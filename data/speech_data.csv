0,Ralph Abraham,0.03976054489612579,R,abraham,abraham," Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, on Friday, July 24, I was unavoidably  detained on rollcall vote No. 166. Had I been present to vote, I would  have voted ``nay'' on rollcall vote No. 166.  Personal Explanation    "
1,Alma Adams,1.7837893962860107,D,adams,adams," Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3 of ', House Resolution 965, ', the yeas and nays are ordered.  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion  will be postponed.    "
2,Robert Aderholt,0.019880272448062897,R,aderholt,aderholt," Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to lend my support of this  fiscal year 2021 appropriations package.  I thank the Chair of the Appropriations Committee, Mrs. Lowey, and my  friend, Chairman Serrano, as they prepare to retire for their many  years of dedication and hard work to this institution and I wish them  both well.  I also want to thank Ranking Member Granger for her outstanding  leadership this year.  I'm pleased that this bill supports the Trump Administration's Moon  to Mars Artemis initiative and rejects radical demands to defund the  police. It also restores long-standing Second Amendment protections  that have enjoyed historical, bipartisan support yet were excluded [["", Page , H7311, ] from the House-passed Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Act.  I am also pleased that this bill rejects issues which previously held  up a COVID relief agreement. This bill provides individuals, families,  health care providers, and businesses the assistance which we can agree  on, to help everyone get through this pandemic. It also looks to the  future by providing additional funding to expand internet access in  rural areas.    "
3,Pete Aguilar,0.04970067739486694,D,aguilar,aguilar," Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  The agreement before us today recognizes that to get our economy  moving again, to return to something that feels like normalcy, we must  get this virus under control.  In this agreement, Democrats secured billions to rapidly distribute a  free and safe vaccine and to invest in nationwide testing and tracing  measures that will save lives.  It isn't perfect, and more action is required to address the  challenges that Americans are facing, but it is everything we can do  right now with this Senate and this President.  With this bill, we have averted a sudden end to unemployment benefits  that millions would have faced and added $300 per week to the benefit.  We funded a new round of survival checks and emergency rental  assistance, included an eviction moratorium, and boosted SNAP and child  nutrition benefits.  And for the small businesses struggling to keep the lights on, this  bill provides billions in economic assistance to forgivable loans.  Across this country, people in communities like mine are hurting.  Frankly, they have been hurting for far too long.  We are going to work with the Biden-Harris administration to build on  this progress and deliver for the American people, and I am confident  that brighter days are ahead.    "
4,Rick Allen,0.03976054489612579,R,allen,allen," Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to vote on December 10, 2020.  Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 242 and  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 243.  personal explanation    "
5,Colin Allred,0.1708884835243225,D,allred,allred," Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I want to speak to the people of north  Texas, many of whom are under Stay Home, Stay Safe orders from smart  leaders like Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins and Dallas Mayor Eric  Johnson.  I know many of you are frightened. I have heard from many of you who  are worried about your family's health, your job, and your business. I  want you to know that we are on your side. We are with you. We will not  let this great country fail. We will defeat this virus in a way that  leaves no one behind.  We should follow the examples of our brave first responders. Every  American owes them a debt of gratitude. But we can best honor their  service by staying home, if you can, and following the orders that have  been issued.    "
6,Justin Amash,0.17892244458198547,R,amash,amash," Mr. AMASH. Madam Speaker, had there been a recorded vote, I would  have voted ``nay'' on "", H.R. 748, ', Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic  Security Act, as amended.    "
7,Mark Amodei,0.36837828159332275,R,amodei,amodei," Mr. AMODEI. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues from Missouri and Ohio  for their graciousness in granting me some time, and also my colleagues  from Tennessee for their comments.  In short, this bill is about savings. It has already been mentioned,  ', H.R. 7995, ' wants to save money when it comes to the fact that it costs  the Mint almost a half-cent to make a nickel. It costs them 1.75 cents  to make a penny. The dime and the quarter are not far behind.  No disrespect to anybody here who has spoken before, but quite  frankly, when all else fails, read the Constitution and read the bill.  The Constitution says that we have the ability to coin money, to  regulate the value of the money, and foreign money, and we also have  weights and measures.  ', H.R. 7995, ' is not a long bill, ladies and gentlemen. Essentially, it  is two pages long, and it talks about changing the metal content.  Nowhere in Article I does it say anything about the content of the  metal of the coin. So when my colleague from Missouri says this is a  commonsense measure that is just meant to save money, it is like that  is it. There is no mystery here.  We lose money on every one of those pennies and nickels that we coin.  We want to regulate. We want to give the Mint the ability to regulate  the metal content.  I am going to say it once more, and then I will stop. We want,  through ', H.R. 7995, "", to give the Mint the ability to regulate the metal  content of the coin. None of the things that are covered in this  provision are in the Constitution, with all due respect.  But guess what? It is not like: Okay, that is it. End of analysis.  Please support the bill.  The last part is this. Despite the fact that it is not in there about  metal content and changing any of the specifically enumerated  constitutional provisions, there are still provisions in this bill that  say: But out of an abundance of caution, let's go ahead and make sure  that the Congress knows when we change the metallic content of a coin,  with the idea of saving money for taxpayers, and make sure that other  stakeholders don't have objections.  So, if anything, we have expanded the meaning of that provision in  the Constitution to say, oh, by the way, [["", Page , H6039, ] let's talk to Congress and make sure they are okay, even though it is  not in this section.  So, with all due respect, I would request your favorable  consideration. I thank the committee of jurisdiction for its look at  this, and I urge your support.    "
8,Kelly Armstrong,0.04970067739486694,R,armstrong,armstrong," Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, with all of the concerns that exist, I  think the goal of transparency and cost effectiveness are still worthy  of this, and I urge support of the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
9,Jodey Arrington,0.19880270957946777,R,arrington,arrington," Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation to  provide relief to our fellow Americans, accelerate our Nation's  economic recovery, and ensure our great Nation comes back better,  stronger, and healthier than ever.  I don't want to belabor my deep concerns with the process except to  say, Mr. Speaker, that it is fundamentally broken and that it was  unnecessarily prolonged for purely political reasons. The American  people waited, and waited for months. They deserve better, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend, fellow Texan and ranking member,  Kay Granger; our leader, Kevin McCarthy; Kevin Brady; and many others  who helped finalize this agreement.  It is far from perfect. I haven't met perfect legislation since  coming to Washington. But it does a good job of supporting our  struggling families, small businesses, healthcare professionals,  teachers, and other frontline workers at a time when many desperately  need it, and all of this at a fraction of Speaker Pelosi's $3.3  trillion bailout bonanza, which included cash for illegals, legalizing  marijuana, and a host of other unnecessary and irresponsible  provisions.  Mr. Speaker, it is no small feat to keep our annual spending below  the budget cap, and I commend my colleagues, including Chairwoman  Lowey, for that.  To do that and prevail in protecting troops and including their pay  raise, funding for the border wall, preserving [["", Page , H7307, ] the sacred protections for our unborn, I have got to tell you, that is  pretty darn good.  It is hard for me to stand for some of this stuff in this bill, this  omnibus. But on balance, it is good for the country, and I am standing  with Chairwoman Lowey, and I am standing with my fellow Texan, Kay  Granger.  God bless America.    "
10,Cindy Axne,1.3378957509994507,D,axne,axne," Mrs. AXNE. Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to cosponsor this amendment  today, to ensure that no taxpayer dollars go toward advancing a lawsuit  that literally threatens the livelihood of millions of Americans.  Mr. Speaker, since 2017, we have seen an administration obsessed with  undermining, sabotaging, and repealing a law that protects millions  living with preexisting conditions in this country.  As we end another month of a devastating health crisis that has taken  the lives of 150,000 Americans, they are doubling down and insisting-- and I quote their own words here--``the ACA must fall.''  This isn't only extraordinarily tone-deaf. It is playing politics  with the lives of people in this country, including Iowans.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman from Illinois  has expired.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to "", House Resolution 1067, ', the  previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Underwood).  The question is on the amendment.  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appear to have it.    "
11,Brian Babin,0.5621753931045532,R,babin,babin," Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of ', S. 1694, ', the One Small Step to  Protect Human Heritage in Space Act.  As an original cosponsor of the House companion bill, ', H.R. 3766, "", I  certainly appreciate the importance of respecting the historic  significance of the Apollo missions.  Mr. Speaker, I represent Johnson Space Center, or JSC, the home of  NASA's Mission Control and the men and women who made the Apollo  missions possible. JSC has a long history of developing spacecraft and  conducting missions in space.  From the very earliest Mercury missions that put the first Americans  in space through Gemini and Apollo missions, as well as the space  shuttle and International Space Station era, Houston has been the  anchor of our Nation's human spaceflight program. As NASA develops the  next generation of human spaceflight capabilities, Houston and JSC will  remain America's tether to deep space.  But while it is important to recognize and respect the  accomplishments of the past, we should not simply rest on our laurels.  We have a lot more to do.  Mr. Speaker, America does not look longingly in the rearview mirror  of history. We stand on the shoulders of giants and carry the torch lit  by those before us farther into the unknown. The bill before us  correctly balances these two competing interests: respecting the past  and enabling the future.  The Outer Space Treaty, drafted at the dawn of the space age, lays  out important principles for all spacefaring nations. It calls for  establishing the Principle of Due Regard, which respects the activities  of actors in space and creates a process for signatories to the treaty  to undertake appropriate consultations before any action that would  potentially cause harmful interference with another party to the  treaty.  More importantly, the treaty establishes, in its opening article, the  overarching principle that outer space, including the Moon and other  celestial bodies, shall be free for exploration and use by all states  without discrimination of any kind on the basis of equality and in  accordance with international law, and there shall be free access to  all areas of celestial bodies.  This bill directs NASA to continue developing recommendations and  best practices that protect this freedom while also respecting the  Principle of Due Regard and informing the practice of consultation  ahead of potentially harmful interference with the Apollo landing  artifacts. The bill also calls on [["", Page , H7222, ] NASA to include these recommendations in all contracts, grants,  cooperative agreements, and partnerships.  The bill does not create any additional regulatory authority.  Instead, the bill offers a carrot rather than a stick. If the private  sector wants to leverage the vast experience and resources that NASA  offers, they simply must abide by NASA's own internal policies.  NASA is not a regulatory agency, and this bill does not grant any  other agency any new power or mechanism to influence commercial space  activities. This will allow our Nation's emerging and vibrant  commercial space sector to continue to innovate, while also respecting  the rich archaeological, anthropological, historical, scientific, and  engineering accomplishments of the Apollo program.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Lucas, Senator Peters, Senator  Cruz, and Chairwoman Johnson for working with me to get this bill  across the finish line.  I also thank Chairwoman Kendra Horn for her leadership over the last  2 years. Her tenure as chairwoman for the Subcommittee on Space and  Aeronautics was marked by significant change and accomplishments for  our Nation's space program.  Her steady and fair treatment for all Members' interests should serve  as a shining example to this distinguished body. She will be missed,  and I wish her the very, very best in the future.  Mr. Speaker, I recommend swift passage of this measure, and I yield  back the balance of my time.  {time} 1615  Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by first thanking Ranking Member Babin,  as well as Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas and Senators  Peters and Cruz, for their work on this.  Particularly, I thank Ranking Member Babin. It has truly been an  honor to be able to work with his on these issues and to do so in a  constructive way that advances policy that is good for the United  States, for discovery, for innovation, and for our leadership in a way  that we can come together.  Space is one of those areas where it is and should be bipartisan,  where we can come together for the best interests of our Nation, to  continue to advance discovery and to encourage innovation.  Mr. Speaker, this bill does just that. It finds the right balance  between preserving the heritage of the Apollo era, for a reminder of  what we can accomplish when we come together to work, to advance  technology, to do what has never been done before, while not placing  too much burden on our ability to move forward into the future and  advance that discovery.  Our Nation's space program has long served as a source of inspiration  and innovation and helped make sure that we, as a nation, are a leader  in technology, innovation, and discovery.  Mr. Speaker, I encourage swift passage of this bill. I encourage all  of my colleagues to vote ``yea,'' and I yield back the balance of my  time.    "
12,Don Bacon,0.8577378392219543,R,bacon,bacon," Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Steve Nelson,  a man who has been at the forefront of Nebraska's booming agriculture  industry and who retired on December 8 of this year as the president of  the Nebraska Farm Bureau, a position he has faithfully served since  2011.  A farmer his whole life, Steve has produced irrigated corn, hybrid  seed corn, and soybeans at his farm near Axtell in south central  Nebraska.  In his work with the Farm Bureau, both before and during his tenure  as president, Steve has helped to secure farm bills and worked to  reform and lower taxes to help protect farm and ranch families.  He has also fought to bolster animal agriculture against those who  want to end it and sought initiatives to grow Nebraska's livestock  industry.  While Texas and Nebraska may have had a rivalry on the football  field, they also have held a rivalry in livestock. During Steve's time  as president, Nebraska was ranked first for several years in commercial  red meat production.  Steve has also advocated for Nebraska's agriculture industry to other  countries, serving as a delegation member to Denmark, Japan, South  Korea, Belgium, and many others.  I am sure his wife, Elma, a retired nurse, is looking forward to  spending more time with her husband and is proud of the work he has  done, as are his kids: Scott and his wife, Amy, who farm with Steve;  and their daughter, Stacy, and her husband, Bobby, who live in Ashland.  Sadly, their daughter, Sarah, passed away unexpectedly in 2006. Of  course, his four grandchildren, I am sure, will spend more time with  grandpa on the farm.  I thank Steve for advocating and bolstering Nebraska's agriculture  industry. I thank him for his friendship and his counsel.  Madam Speaker, I wish Steve the best on his retirement from the  bureau.    "
13,James Baird,0.03976054489612579,R,baird,baird," Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor Linden, Indiana,  resident Dr. Mark Eutsler.  This year marks the 25th year that Dr. Eutsler has co-chaired the  nationally televised IPL 500 Festival Parade. Using his experience as  the former director of bands at McCutcheon High School, he has helped  over 45,000 students from 425 Indiana schools participate in the  nationally acclaimed IPL 500 Festival Parade.  Prior to his appointment as co-chair, Dr. Eutsler has served as an  enthusiastic supporter of the Indianapolis 500 Festival for decades.  Mark has attended the parade consistently since 1980 and has been a  volunteer for the event for 29 years.  Dr. Eutsler's consecutive years of service stand out among the more  than 3,000 volunteers who will fill roughly 7,000 positions for the  month-long May event every year.  Dr. Mark Eutsler is a pillar of the community. I express my deepest  thanks and appreciation for his passion and for the service he has  devoted to a program that defines Hoosier heritage.    "
14,Troy Balderson,0.06958094984292984,R,balderson,balderson," Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Neil A.  Armstrong Test Facility Act. The Buckeye State is honored to have been  the home of American hero Neil Alden Armstrong.  From the Wright brothers to the namesake of this legislation, Ohio  boasts a rich history as leaders in the aerospace industry.  Born in northwest Ohio, Neil Armstrong made history on July 21, 1969,  as he uttered the words: ``That's one small step for man, one giant  leap for mankind.''  As the first human being to step foot on the Moon, Neil Armstrong  inspired generations of Americans to literally follow in his footsteps.  The United States owes a debt of gratitude to Mr. Armstrong for his  service at NASA through multiple space exploration programs, as well as  the U.S. Navy.  The Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility Act would honor this American  hero by bestowing his name on a critical NASA test facility station in  Armstrong's home State of Ohio.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the Neil A.  Armstrong Test Facility Act.  Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    "
15,Jim Banks,0.5771211385726929,R,banks,banks," Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding time  to me today and for his many years of service. America and the world  are safer today because of Mac Thornberry's service in the United  States House of Representatives.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Smith, the chairman of the committee, as  well, for ensuring that this year's NDAA is bipartisan once again.  Mr. Speaker, I want to rise most of all in support of the aptly named  Mac Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act.  While the bill doesn't include everything I want it to and there are  certainly items that I wish would be removed, overall, it ensures that  our Nation is protected, and it supports our men and women in uniform.  So many in the Trump administration have warned us for years that  China is our Nation's long-term strategic competitor, and countering  China is a key focus of the fiscal year 2021 NDAA.  Having just been a part of the Future of Defense Task Force and the  China Task Force, I am more motivated than ever before to stop the  Chinese Communist Party's egregious affronts on the U.S. Government,  its citizens, and our military. I appreciate the inclusion of many  important recommendations from both of those task force reports in this  year's NDAA.  This NDAA establishes the Pacific Deterrence Initiative to strengthen  U.S. posture and capability in the Indo-Pacific region, and it works  better with [["", Page , H6927, ] allies to deter against Chinese malign behavior.  {time} 1330  It also protects against Chinese industrial espionage by requiring a  Presidential assessment on how to deter it and large-scale cyber threat  of intellectual property and personal information.  The NDAA also includes a number of protections for Federal  investments in science and technology by including new mandates on  university research and limiting funding for universities with  Confucius Institutes, for example.  These are just some of the very important provisions in this year's  bill, to not just acknowledge the China threat, Mr. Speaker, but to  address it head-on. That is why I urge all of my colleagues to vote in  favor of this critical legislation.    "
16,Andy Barr,2.2088539600372314,R,barr,barr," Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of long-delayed  legislation to deliver more resources to the [["", Page , H7296, ] American people to defeat the COVID-19 virus and provide much-needed  relief from government-imposed lockdowns of the economy.  Ultimately, no amount of government spending can substitute for a  fully functioning, open economy free of government lockdowns. But I am  confident this relief package, which provides over $284 billion to  reload and strengthen the Paycheck Protection Program, will help bridge  the gap until COVID-19 vaccines are widely distributed. It does so in a  fiscally responsible way by rescinding and reallocating $429 billion in  Federal Reserve emergency lending authority, and it repurposes unused  PPP funds.  Importantly, this bill provides effective, targeted relief, with a  net price tag of approximately $325 billion in new outlays. It does not  include the liberal wish list that was the centerpiece of the Speaker's  originally $3.4 trillion Heroes Act, a fiscally reckless proposal that  needlessly delayed this reasonable bipartisan compromise.  For months, I have called on Congress and the administration to  simplify the PPP forgiveness application for small businesses to ease  their burdens and ensure lender participation. Today, that goal becomes  a reality.  I also support the bill's extension of troubled debt restructuring  relief, which allows lenders to work with their borrowers to modify  loans. And I strongly support its provision to ensure small businesses  can deduct expenses covered by PPP loans.  While it has taken far too long to get to this point, the bill we are  passing today will bring much-needed help to American workers,  families, and small businesses, without putting more massive amounts of  debt on the American people.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.    "
17,Nanette Barragan,0.8301119804382324,D,barragan,barragan," Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of "", H.R. 4499, ', the  NIMHD Research Endowment Revitalization Act, a bill I introduced with  my friend and colleague from Georgia, Congressman Carter.  This legislation moves us closer to ending the disparities in public  health between minority communities and other Americans. We need to  understand why people in minority communities are more likely to get  certain illnesses and how we can prevent that. ', H.R. 4499, "" will fund the  research that will help us find solutions.  If signed into law, this bill will once again allow for current and  former NIMHD or HRSA Centers of Excellence to receive research  endowment funding, money that is critical in the fight to reduce  minority health disparities.  The Research Endowment Program at the National Institute on Minority  Health and Health Disparities provides funding to the endowments of  academic institutions across the country, such as Charles Drew  University in my district.  The goals of the program include:  Promoting minority health and health disparities research capacity  and infrastructure;  Increasing the diversity and strength of the scientific workforce;  and  Enhancing the recruitment and retention of individuals from health  disparity populations that are underrepresented in the scientific  workforce.  Charles Drew University has stated that this legislation and the  funding are critical to their mission and that they support this  legislation because:  ``Restoring eligibility would allow the University to continue its  historic focus on research to close the gap between the burden of  illness and premature mortality experienced more commonly by  communities of color, as well as other medically underserved  populations, as compared to the nation as a whole. It would also help  to grow and enhance the University's capacity and infrastructure for  health disparities research within the Urban Health Institute.''  During the COVID health emergency, where communities of color are  once again disproportionately affected, research into health  disparities is more crucial than ever.  I want to once again thank my colleague Congressman Carter for co- leading this bill with me, as well as the other bipartisan cosponsors:  Congresswoman Kelly, Congressman Rogers, and the late John Lewis. I  also want to thank Chairman Pallone for working with me to help move  this important bill through the Committee.  I urge all my colleagues to vote yes on the NIMHD Research Endowment  Revitalization Act so that these schools can continue this important  research on minority health disparities.  Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science Statement on "", H.R. 4499, '  Charles R. Drew University of Medicine in Science (CDU) is   in strong support of ', H.R. 4499, ' which amend the Public Health   Service Act to provide that the authority of the Director of   the National Institute on Minority Health and Health   Disparities to make certain research endowments applies with   respect to both current and former centers of excellence, and   for other purposes.  If enacted ', H.R. 4499, "" would reinstate the University's   eligibility for NIMHD endowment grants that were withdrawn   because the University had received endowment grants for 10   years despite being underfunded for its critical health   disparities research. [["", Page , H5805, ]  Restoring eligibility would allow the University to continue   its historic focus on research to close the gap between the   burden of illness and premature mortality experienced more   commonly by communities of color, as well as other medically   underserved populations, as compared to the nation as a   whole. It would also help to grow and enhance the   University's capacity and infrastructure for health   disparities research within the Urban Health Institute.  Respectfully Submitted,  David M. Carlisle, MD, PhD,  President and CEO, Charles R. Drew  University of Medicine and Science.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, "", H.R. 4499, ', as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "

Ms. BASS (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  to dispense with the reading of the amendment.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from California?  There was no objection.  The amendment was agreed to.  The concurrent resolution was concurred in.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
19,Joyce Beatty,1.2930370569229126,D,beatty,beatty," Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for  yielding.  I rise today to support this legislation because my constituents  desperately need the unemployment benefits, the stimulus checks, the  food assistance, the eviction moratoriums, the small business Minority  Development Institution funds and the CDFI assistance funds, and other  protections in this bill.  Seven months after the House passed the Heroes Act, Republicans have  finally relented to allow more support to the American people who are  struggling through the three pandemics: COVID-19, economic hardships,  and social injustices.  So let me be clear: The GOP has had a knee on Americans' necks by  holding this bill up, and it still falls short of what we need to get  through this crisis.  But I will continue to stand up for my constituents of the Third  Congressional District and for people across this Nation and my  colleagues to work with the Biden administration to get people the  support they need to build back better.    "
20,Ami Bera,0.9858531951904297,D,bera,bera," Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge support of my resolution,  ', H. Res. 1012, ', which recognizes the transformation of the U.S.-South  Korea relationship into a strong and enduring partnership that benefits  the entire world.  As the proud co-chair of the Korea Caucus and the co-chair of the  Congressional Study Group on Korea, I know how important this  relationship is to our two countries.  This spring, I introduced this resolution because I wanted to  acknowledge and highlight the shared history and ties between our  nations.  It was over 70 years ago that the United States rushed to the aid of  the Republic of Korea after they were attacked by its neighbor to the  north.  The United States, leading the multinational coalition of the United  Nations Command, successfully defended the Republic of Korea.  But the war devastated South Korea. Forty years ago, South Korea was  one of the poorest countries in the world. Today, they are one of the  most advanced. It is a miracle, and it is hard work.  The Republic of Korea became a democracy in the late 1980s. Today, it  is one of the most widely respected countries in Asia and the world. It  has been incredibly successful against the COVID-19 pandemic and has  helped the United States in our own battle against it.  President-elect Biden has recognized the value of our relationship  with Korea, and his call to President Moon Jae-in was one of the first  calls to a foreign leader.  Our ties with the Republic of Korea are enduring. They are based on  our shared people-to-people values, our vibrant Korean-American  community, American expatriates in South Korea, and our economic ties.  We have shared values and respect for democracy and human rights. We  will work together to confront the challenges of this pandemic, as well  as other challenges, like climate change.  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who support and  sustain this alliance, as well as Chairman Engel and Ranking Member  McCaul and their staff, like Theresa Lou, who helped bring this  resolution to the floor.    "
21,Jack Bergman,1.3701997995376587,R,bergman,bergman," Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of "", H.R. 7105, "", the  Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits  Improvement Act of 2020.  I consider the word ``optimism'' to mean hope that actually includes  a plan, and I have sincere optimism that the bipartisan legislative  package before us today will serve as a blueprint for the great work we  can achieve in the next Congress by working together. More importantly,  I have confidence that it will make a positive difference in veterans'  lives.  For example, "", H.R. 7105, "" includes my legislation, the GI Bill Planning  Act of 2019, which will give military enlistees greater ability to  consider which GI Bill benefits are right for them.  Just think, in the heat of the first 2 weeks of their boot camp, 70  percent of enlistees decide to pay $1,200 upfront to opt into their  Montgomery GI Bill benefit, but 97 percent actually end up using the  more robust post-9/11 GI Bill. By delaying this Montgomery GI Bill opt- in decision 6 months and responsibly ending new enrollment in 10 years,  we will actually save recruits money and ensure they are more informed  on their future education benefits.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for  including not only my bill but several other major measures that I have  co-led to improve VA transparency in benefits decisions, as well as  increase accountability in the Department's efforts to address programs  that are at a high risk of waste, fraud, and abuse.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support "", H.R. 7105, "", and I wish  Dr. Roe fair winds and following seas.    "
22,Don Beyer,1.1953010559082031,D,beyer,beyer," Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise to support the CASH Act, which will  send $2,000 checks to the American people.  I want to thank Chairman Neal for coming together very quickly to  create this act in a thoughtful way.  The American people are hurting this holiday season, and they need  our help. Our bill would increase those payments to $2,000, which would  also include adult dependents and students.  We realize that $600 is not enough for people facing eviction and  hunger. For many, this will just pay a past-due rental bill for July.  It is good and important that we are sending support to small  businesses, strong unemployment aid, nutrition and rental assistance,  but this relief is coming 7 months later than it should have. It is  vital that Congress not penny-pinch the American people now.  This CASH bill is bipartisan, and if Senator Mitch McConnell would  put it on the Senate floor, it would be bicameral.  Let me push back, too, that this is too much.  We have 40 million Americans who work full-time and made less than  $18,000 last year. With the minimum wage at $7.25, there isn't a single  two-bedroom apartment you can rent in a county in America for that  money. There are tens of millions without healthcare.  My family sells new cars and used cars. I have watched the debt  burden of so many people just rise and rise and rise over the years.  Is there a better way? You know, my Republican friends hate it when  so-called Big Government decides what we need. The best way to let  people manage their family is to put the money in their hands, give  them that American freedom.  Somehow, we can print money to do a $4 trillion tax cut over 20  years, but we can't print enough money to help the American people.  This is a good bill. I salute Chairman Richard Neal, and I hope every  Democrat and every Republican will vote for it.    "

24,Gus Bilirakis,1.7130862474441528,R,bilirakis,bilirakis," Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of ', H.R. 2477, "",  the Beneficiary Enrollment Notification and Eligibility Simplification  Act, the BENES Act.  Unfortunately, complex and confusing Medicare enrollment rules  combined with a lack of notification cause tens of thousands of older  adults and people with disabilities to incur lifetime fines, coverage  gaps, and other harmful consequences. This is not fair to our seniors.  With fewer people automatically enrolled in Medicare and 10,000 baby  boomers aging into Medicare each day, more people new to Medicare must  actively enroll in the program.  To address this issue, the BENES Act is here for us. It directs the  Federal Government to provide advance notice to individuals approaching  Medicare eligibility about basic Medicare and Medicare Advantage  enrollment rules.  It directs Part B to begin the first of the month following one's  enrollment during both the later months of their initial enrollment  period and during the general enrollment period, closing coverage gaps.  It also requires HHS to submit a report to Congress on how best to  align the annual general enrollment period with the annual enrollment  period for private Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription  drug plans to reduce confusion.  And it enables HHS to create a Part B special enrollment period for  exceptional circumstances; a provision currently used in Medicare  Advantage and Medicare Part D when people are unable to sign up for  Medicare due to occurrences, like living in an area impacted by a  disaster or emergency.  I thank my colleague, Dr. Ruiz, for his leadership and partnership on  this particular bill.  Madam Speaker, all of these bills are so vital to our seniors, very  important bills, and I am glad we are passing them in a bipartisan  fashion.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues, again, to support this  commonsense protective measure for seniors, veterans, and those living  with disabilities.    "
25,Dan Bishop,0.5403762459754944,R,bishop,bishop," Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of "", H.R. 5472, "", the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park Redesignation Act.  The legislation would change the name of the Jimmy Carter National  Historic Site in Plains, Georgia, to the Jimmy Carter National  Historical Park, thereby ensuring that its nomenclature conforms to  other noncontiguous sites within the National Park System.  It would also honor the wishes of our Nation's 39th President, who is  a dear friend of mine, as well as my constituent.  On March 22, 2019, President Carter also became our Nation's longest- living President, surpassing the lifespan of George H.W. Bush. In  October, he celebrated his 96th birthday.  As many of you are aware, President Carter has had a number of health  challenges recently, which has created a sense of urgency around this  legislation and the rich legacy that he and Mrs. Rosalynn Carter want  to leave for their longtime home in Plains, Georgia.  After the Carters left the White House, the Carters and Plains  community took the initiative to preserve and protect the history of  this small, rural, agricultural community.  In 1987, Congress established the Jimmy Carter National Historic  Site. As you have heard, it consists of the Plains Railroad Depot,  which served as Jimmy Carter's campaign headquarters during the 1976  Presidential campaign; Jimmy Carter's boyhood farm; Plains High School,  which the Carters both attended, and which now serves as the visitor  center and museum; and the Carter home and compound, where the Carters  currently live, which is now closed to the public.  In fact, the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site is the only site in  the National Park System, aside from the White House, that is still an  active Presidential home. I have taken my entire staff there on a  number of occasions so that they could get a better feel and  understanding of the values that shaped this great Georgian.  Madam Speaker, "", H.R. 5472, ' enjoys the bipartisan support of the entire  Georgia congressional delegation, as well as the Plains community.  Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member  Bishop on the full committee, and Chairwoman Haaland and Ranking Member  Young on the National Park Subcommittee. I thank Mr. Gallego and his  able staff members, Brandon Bragato and Lily Wang, for all of their  help in bringing this legislation to the House today under suspension  of the rules.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.    "
26,Dan Bishop,0.5403762459754944,R,bishop,bishop," Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I called Lisa Pittman,  who is the counsel for our committee, to make sure we had somebody  covering us for floor time.  She chastised me then, saying that under my condition, I need to ask  about calling a doctor first, not calling a lawyer.  No, Lisa, we call you not just for legal advice but for all sorts of  things. For 38 years, she has been a true public servant, with 33  consecutive years here in the House where she has served with poise  under pressure and always brings an air of stability.  We ask opinions of a lot of people, but we always double-check by  going to Lisa because she understands it all.  She served under 17 Republican leaders in Natural Resources. I still  think I am her favorite one--trust me. But even yesterday, she still  told my chief of staff that she gets choked up when she looks at the  Capitol dome or hears the Pledge of Allegiance. It is still magical to  her.  As our committee mom, when she brings cupcakes to everyone on their  birthdays and special occasions, her kindness is magic to the rest of  us.  So, when I leave at the end of the month, no one is really going to  care. When Lisa leaves at the end of the month, it is going to take  decades to replace the institutional knowledge that she brings to this  place.  Lisa, we thank you. And, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your indulgence.    "
27,Dan Bishop,0.5403762459754944,R,bishop,bishop," Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.  Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Texas' comment that the MORE Act  would make us safer calls for a specific response.  As Representative Jordan just said, the fact that the MORE Act is on  the floor at this time epitomizes Democrats' misplaced priorities. But  it also puts on display their inclination to reckless disregard of  consequences.  Just like the clarion call to defund the police, followed rapidly by  astonished surprise over the ensuing surge in violence, Democrats' rush  to legalize marijuana without any heed or response to the rising  epidemic of drug driving across the country would mean more dead and  injured Americans on our highways.  Consider this: since 2013, in Washington State, the number of fatal  crash drivers who tested positive for THC has more than doubled. In  Vermont, since 2010, fatal crashes linked to marijuana use have  skyrocketed by 173 percent following that State's decriminalization.  Forty-seven percent of Oregonians who died in a car crash in 2018  tested positive for marijuana, according to the Oregon State Police.  More Indiana drivers in deadly car crashes test positive for drugs than  for alcohol.  The data is clear: when governments liberalize marijuana laws,  motorists and passengers die.  {time} 0945  Law enforcement tells us they lack a reliable roadside test to detect  marijuana use or a uniform standard to measure marijuana toxicity, yet  our defund-the-police Democrat colleagues rush to change the status quo  across the entire country while refusing even to consider my  commonsense amendment that would require the Department of  Transportation to develop and prescribe best practices for testing  drivers suspected of marijuana impairment.  My amendment would help law enforcement keep people safe, but  Democrats would rather prioritize criminals. A North Carolina sheriff  recently called drug driving ``one of the leading killers in our  State.'' Just like Democrats' efforts to defund police, the MORE Act's  unintended consequences will include increased danger for our families.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support Americans' safety by  voting against this bill.  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Texas has 17 minutes  remaining. The gentleman from Ohio has 17 minutes remaining, also.  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me indicate that this legislation  does not take away any of the responsibilities of the Department of  Transportation in its regulatory authority, and the facts belie any  worries regarding road safety.  According to a 2018 study of the National Bureau of Economic  Research, States that have legalized marijuana have not experienced  significantly different rates of marijuana- or alcohol-related traffic  fatalities.  All of the State laws dealing with driving under the influence  remain. Operating a motor vehicle under the influence of marijuana is  still illegal in every State--we insist on that--and even in these  States that have legalized the substance, and the MORE Act leaves these  in place.  Mr. Speaker, we need to talk about the many deaths that have occurred  because of the violence over illegal marijuana. I have seen it. We have  seen it. We have lost lives in their future, and we have lost them to  their families.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa), a member of the Committee on the Judiciary.    "

It would also honor the wishes of our Nation's 39th President, who is  a dear friend of mine, as well as my constituent.  On March 22, 2019, President Carter also became our Nation's longest- living President, surpassing the lifespan of George H.W. Bush. In  October, he celebrated his 96th birthday.  As many of you are aware, President Carter has had a number of health  challenges recently, which has created a sense of urgency around this  legislation and the rich legacy that he and Mrs. Rosalynn Carter want  to leave for their longtime home in Plains, Georgia.  After the Carters left the White House, the Carters and Plains  community took the initiative to preserve and protect the history of  this small, rural, agricultural community.  In 1987, Congress established the Jimmy Carter National Historic  Site. As you have heard, it consists of the Plains Railroad Depot,  which served as Jimmy Carter's campaign headquarters during the 1976  Presidential campaign; Jimmy Carter's boyhood farm; Plains High School,  which the Carters both attended, and which now serves as the visitor  center and museum; and the Carter home and compound, where the Carters  currently live, which is now closed to the public.  In fact, the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site is the only site in  the National Park System, aside from the White House, that is still an  active Presidential home. I have taken my entire staff there on a  number of occasions so that they could get a better feel and  understanding of the values that shaped this great Georgian.  Madam Speaker, "", H.R. 5472, ' enjoys the bipartisan support of the entire  Georgia congressional delegation, as well as the Plains community.  Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member  Bishop on the full committee, and Chairwoman Haaland and Ranking Member  Young on the National Park Subcommittee. I thank Mr. Gallego and his  able staff members, Brandon Bragato and Lily Wang, for all of their  help in bringing this legislation to the House today under suspension  of the rules.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.    "
34,Sanford Bishop,1.2581554651260376,D,bishop,bishop," Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I called Lisa Pittman,  who is the counsel for our committee, to make sure we had somebody  covering us for floor time.  She chastised me then, saying that under my condition, I need to ask  about calling a doctor first, not calling a lawyer.  No, Lisa, we call you not just for legal advice but for all sorts of  things. For 38 years, she has been a true public servant, with 33  consecutive years here in the House where she has served with poise  under pressure and always brings an air of stability.  We ask opinions of a lot of people, but we always double-check by  going to Lisa because she understands it all.  She served under 17 Republican leaders in Natural Resources. I still  think I am her favorite one--trust me. But even yesterday, she still  told my chief of staff that she gets choked up when she looks at the  Capitol dome or hears the Pledge of Allegiance. It is still magical to  her.  As our committee mom, when she brings cupcakes to everyone on their  birthdays and special occasions, her kindness is magic to the rest of  us.  So, when I leave at the end of the month, no one is really going to  care. When Lisa leaves at the end of the month, it is going to take  decades to replace the institutional knowledge that she brings to this  place.  Lisa, we thank you. And, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your indulgence.    "
35,Sanford Bishop,1.2581554651260376,D,bishop,bishop," Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.  Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Texas' comment that the MORE Act  would make us safer calls for a specific response.  As Representative Jordan just said, the fact that the MORE Act is on  the floor at this time epitomizes Democrats' misplaced priorities. But  it also puts on display their inclination to reckless disregard of  consequences.  Just like the clarion call to defund the police, followed rapidly by  astonished surprise over the ensuing surge in violence, Democrats' rush  to legalize marijuana without any heed or response to the rising  epidemic of drug driving across the country would mean more dead and  injured Americans on our highways.  Consider this: since 2013, in Washington State, the number of fatal  crash drivers who tested positive for THC has more than doubled. In  Vermont, since 2010, fatal crashes linked to marijuana use have  skyrocketed by 173 percent following that State's decriminalization.  Forty-seven percent of Oregonians who died in a car crash in 2018  tested positive for marijuana, according to the Oregon State Police.  More Indiana drivers in deadly car crashes test positive for drugs than  for alcohol.  The data is clear: when governments liberalize marijuana laws,  motorists and passengers die.  {time} 0945  Law enforcement tells us they lack a reliable roadside test to detect  marijuana use or a uniform standard to measure marijuana toxicity, yet  our defund-the-police Democrat colleagues rush to change the status quo  across the entire country while refusing even to consider my  commonsense amendment that would require the Department of  Transportation to develop and prescribe best practices for testing  drivers suspected of marijuana impairment.  My amendment would help law enforcement keep people safe, but  Democrats would rather prioritize criminals. A North Carolina sheriff  recently called drug driving ``one of the leading killers in our  State.'' Just like Democrats' efforts to defund police, the MORE Act's  unintended consequences will include increased danger for our families.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support Americans' safety by  voting against this bill.  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Texas has 17 minutes  remaining. The gentleman from Ohio has 17 minutes remaining, also.  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me indicate that this legislation  does not take away any of the responsibilities of the Department of  Transportation in its regulatory authority, and the facts belie any  worries regarding road safety.  According to a 2018 study of the National Bureau of Economic  Research, States that have legalized marijuana have not experienced  significantly different rates of marijuana- or alcohol-related traffic  fatalities.  All of the State laws dealing with driving under the influence  remain. Operating a motor vehicle under the influence of marijuana is  still illegal in every State--we insist on that--and even in these  States that have legalized the substance, and the MORE Act leaves these  in place.  Mr. Speaker, we need to talk about the many deaths that have occurred  because of the violence over illegal marijuana. I have seen it. We have  seen it. We have lost lives in their future, and we have lost them to  their families.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa), a member of the Committee on the Judiciary.    "
36,Sanford Bishop,1.2581554651260376,D,bishop,bishop," Mr. BISHOP of UTAH. Mr. Chair, unlike the other amendments that we  have had, this is the only one that is added here that actually has had  a hearing. It has had a markup, it has gone through regular order, and  it is the only one that is not doing something that is duplicative.  This is a problem that does exist and trying to make it to actually  happen. Everything else we have talked about is stuff that is nice, but  it is duplicative. It doesn't actually do anything. This is the only  one that does something, and it does something in a positive way.    "
37,Earl Blumenauer,1.4485374689102173,D,blumenauer,blumenauer," Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's kind  comments and cooperation. Working with the ranking member, working with  Dr. Harris, we made real progress here.  Mr. Speaker, the cannabis laws in this country are broken, especially  those that deal with research. It is illegal everywhere in America to  drive under the influence of alcohol, cannabis, or any other substance.  But we do not have a good test for impairment because we can't study  it. Now, Dr. Harris and I don't necessarily agree on the efficacy of  cannabis, but we agree that this is insane and that we need to change  it.  At a time when there are 4 million registered medical cannabis  patients, and many more who self-medicate, when there are 91 percent of  Americans supporting medical cannabis, it is time to change the system.  Our bill will do precisely that. We have a broad coalition of Members  and organizations who support the bill, including those who do have  concerns about cannabis.  Specifically, the bill will tackle two main issues: research  licensing and manufacturing. For manufacturers, it requires the DEA to  license outside of the NIDA monopoly so we can study the products  Americans are using. For researchers, it shortens the timelines,  reduces unnecessary security measures, and streamlines approval. [["", Page , H7080, ]  This bill will not only reduce barriers to medical research but all  cannabis research. It is a narrow bill that fixes one of many broken  cannabis laws.  I want to hasten to add that this in no way negates the need to move  forward with other areas of legislation, like we did with the MORE Act.  But this is sort of a foundational question. No matter where you are,  there is no reason the Federal Government should impede this critical  research.  One of the most moving moments I have had in the last 2 years working  on this issue was in the backyard of a constituent in southeast  Portland who brought together a half dozen families with children with  extreme seizure disorder. The only thing that stopped those babies from  being tortured was medical cannabis. They had to research it  themselves. They had to formulate it themselves.  At Oregon Health and Science University, they told me: This works. We  know it works. We could go to the street corner and buy something, but  we legally can't do it.  Listening to those heartbreaking stories of the families, of what  they had to do--they crossed their fingers. It sort of worked for them.  But no family should have to do that.  We ought to get the Federal obstacles out of the way of simple,  commonsense research. It will make a difference for families across the  country. We need to move forward, so there is no unnecessary dispute  about cannabis, and get the job done.  Support the Medical Marijuana Research Act  Dear Colleague: We write to encourage you to cosponsor our   bill, the Medical Marijuana Research Act ("", H.R. 3797, "").   Regardless of your stance on marijuana, we can all agree that   there should not be onerous federal barriers to conduct   research and access objective evidence as to the medicinal   properties of marijuana.  Although more than two-thirds of Americans are living in   states with legal marijuana programs, current federal law   greatly limits researchers' ability to research this drug.   This includes the overly burdensome registration process,   redundant protocol reviews, lack of adequate research   material and unnecessarily onerous security requirements. In   fact, a 2017 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and   Medicine report found that ``research on the health effects   of cannabis and cannabinoids has been limited in the United   States, leaving patients, health care professionals, and   policy makers without the evidence they need to make sound   decisions regarding the use of cannabis and cannabinoids.   This lack of evidence-based information on the health effects   of cannabis and cannabinoids poses a public health risk.'' We   could not agree more.  The Medical Marijuana Research Act will reduce many of the   barriers to conducting legitimate medical marijuana research.   First, the bill streamlines the burdensome and often   duplicative licensure process for researchers seeking to   conduct marijuana research, while still maintaining all   necessary safeguards against misuse and abuse. Second, it   addresses the woefully inadequate, both in quantity and   quality, supply of medical-grade marijuana available for use   in such research. Finally, it requires, within five years of   enactment, a report by the secretary of the U.S. Department   of Health and Human Services on the status and results of the   then-available body of research on marijuana.  Irrespective of where one falls on the ideological spectrum   with respect to further legalization, we can all agree that   the American people deserve to know what's going on with   marijuana. The United States leads the world in biomedical   research. It is therefore unconscionable that the federal   government stands as the chief impediment to legitimate   medical research that will ensure American physicians,   patients, purchasers, and constituents have access to the   information they need to make an informed decision about   marijuana.  Sincerely,  Earl Blumenauer,  Member of Congress.  Andy Harris, M.D.,  Member of Congress.    "
38,Lisa Blunt Rochester,1.6579475402832031,D,blunt,blunt," Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with respect  to the McFarland nomination, the motion to reconsider be considered  made [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7136"">Page S7136</a>, ] and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action.    "
39,Suzanne Bonamici,1.9157012701034546,D,bonamici,bonamici," Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Consolidated  Appropriations Act, which includes my bipartisan Water Power Research  and Development Act.  As we work to mitigate the climate crisis and transition to a 100  percent clean energy economy, we cannot ignore our ocean. It covers  more than 70 percent of the surface of our planet, and we can capture  the power of its waves, currents, and tides to power our homes,  buildings, and communities.  Marine energy has tremendous potential as one of the last untapped  renewable energy sources, and federal investment can help unlock it.  Earlier this year, I was pleased to work with my House Oceans Caucus  CoChair, Congressman Don Young, and another marine energy enthusiast  from the east coast, Congressman Ted Deutch, to introduce the  bipartisan Water Power Research and Development Act. The bill would  reauthorize funding for research, development, demonstration, and  commercialization of marine energy within the Department of Energy's  Water Power Technologies Office. Importantly, the bill authorizes  funding for existing and new National Marine Energy Centers, including  the Pacific Marine Energy Center--operated by Oregon State University,  the University of Washington, and the University of Alaska Fairbanks.  Researchers at Oregon State University are leading the way on this  innovative work. Through the Pacific Marine Energy Center, OSU is  currently in the process of developing PacWave, the first of its kind  wave energy test facility off the Oregon Coast. Their leadership  scaling up the PacWave testing facility will catalyze this nascent  industry. Additionally, we are fortunate to have the advanced  manufacturing capacity of companies like Vigor, which recently  constructed an 826-ton wave energy device that was deployed off the  shores of Hawaii. It was not until I visited Vigor to see the device  that I grasped the scale of this resource and what we can gain from it.  I appreciate the support of Chairwoman Johnson in helping to secure  the inclusion of the Water Power Research and Development Act in  today's comprehensive energy package and end of year spending bill, and  I am thrilled that it will soon be signed into law. I urge all of my  colleagues to support this bill, which is an important step forward in  advancing ocean climate action.    "
40,Mike Bost,0.7493078708648682,R,bost,bost," Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I stand in full support of "", H.R. 7105, "", and I am  proud to be the sponsor of several provisions included in today's  veterans' omnibus bill.  The first is a provision that would modernize the Service-Disabled  Veterans Insurance program by increasing the maximum coverage from  $10,000 to $40,000; ensuring that veterans cannot be denied coverage  for any preexisting condition; removing the requirement that veterans  apply for coverage within 2 years of receiving an award of service  connection; and requiring premiums to cover the long-term cost of the  program, like the VA has with other life insurance programs.  Once the modernization program goes into effect, the outdated program  would be sunset for new applicants.  Another provision of mine will authorize a pilot program to extend  license portability to certain nonphysician providers who perform  disability exams under contract with the VA. As a result, contract  vendors will be able to schedule a veteran's exam sooner. [["", Page , H7207, ] This is critical, as the VBA focuses its efforts on reducing the  backlogs of disability exams that has been caused by the pandemic.  Additionally, this bill will address a problem that occurred when a  veteran has a change in their dependency status, but the VA does not  take immediate action to reduce the veteran's benefits payments. As a  result, the veteran may incur an overpayment that the veteran must pay  back. My provision would allow a veteran to remove their dependent from  their award through eBenefits within 60 days of the veteran's input and  without VA approval.  This package also includes another one of my bills, "", H.R. 7445, "", which  would expand eligibility for VA home loans programs to certain members  of the National Guard and Reserve.  Mr. Speaker, it is only right and logical that members of the  National Guard and Reserve who perform Federal Active Duty be given the  same benefits as their full-time Active Duty counterparts.  Before I close, I would like to thank Ranking Member Roe for his  leadership on the committee these past 4 years, both as ranking member  and as chairman. He has done a great job of representing the veterans  of this Nation and making sure that his focus and the committee's focus  is kept on what is best for them.  I want to thank him for how he treats and works with each member of  the staff, as well as each Member, to guide us through. Remember, under  his guidance, we have enacted several pieces of legislative  accomplishments, including appeals reform, the MISSION Act, and the  Forever GI Bill.  Now, as the full committee ranking member, I hope to follow in his  footsteps, and I hope I can do him proud and continue our work to  improve benefits and services for our veterans and their families.

41,Kevin Brady,0.09940135478973389,R,brady,brady," Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I demand the yeas and nays.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3 of ', House Resolution 965, ', the yeas and nays are ordered.  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion  will be postponed.    "
42,Kevin Brady,0.09940135478973389,R,brady,brady," Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Madam Speaker, this bill is a tax cut for the wealthy and a green  light for State and local politicians to raise taxes on local families  even higher.  The Center for American Progress and the Center on Budget and Policy  Priorities are liberal organizations I don't generally agree with, but  today, I have to say I do.  The Center for American Progress has made it plain. They said  repealing the SALT cap shouldn't be a high priority, in fact, that this  is overwhelmingly a tax cut for the rich.  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities agrees. They said  repealing the SALT cap, what Democrats are proposing to do today, is  regressive and overwhelmingly benefits high-income households. And they  go further and say this is little help to the middle class.  {time} 1415  It is a sad day when it is obvious to everyone but Democrats that  they are championing a huge tax cut for millionaires and billionaires,  while the middle class in America get zip.  Today we debate their insistence on hiking taxes on Main Street  businesses across America to pay for their massive tax windfall for the  wealthy 1 percent.  You think your local property taxes are high now? This legislation is  a starter pistol for a new race among State and local leaders.  Who of them will be first to raise property taxes, sales taxes, and  income taxes even higher on working families and local businesses?  These unpopular local taxes, frankly, are brutal enough.  This bill truly is a tax cut for the few.  According to the liberal Tax Policy Center, only 1 percent of  taxpayers in America paid more taxes last year due to the reasonable  SALT cap, 1 percent; in California, only 2; in New York, a mere 3.  The rest of taxpayers in America either received a tax cut or they  broke even. That is because the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  lowered taxes on income across the board. We doubled the child tax  deduction and expanded it to far more families. We doubled the standard  deduction so more working families keep more of what they earn. We  eliminated the alternative minimum tax for households making less than  $1 million.  This was important, because more and more families, including in  high-tax States, especially in high-tax States, found the AMT canceled  out their charitable and SALT deductions completely.  Another myth that has been debunked is that tax reform hurts State  budgets. It is just the opposite.  Many States across America enjoyed a windfall in new revenues, an  average of 6 percent, with stronger economies, more workers, and an  expanded tax base.  California Governor Gavin Newsom wrongly predicted capping SALT would  result in lower revenues for California. In truth, his State brought in  a whopping $3 billion more in personal income taxes than he predicted.  It was the same story in all the high-tax States, including New Jersey.  So the question is, what did these States do with their windfall? Did  they pocket these extra dollars or did they pass them through to their  families and local businesses by reducing State and local taxes?  To their credit, 13 States reduced their SALT tax burden, but not in  the high-tax States, who need it most. [["", Page , H12272, ]  States like New Jersey actually raised their State and local taxes,  while New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts are debating even higher  SALT taxes.  So if governors, legislators, and mayors keep raising local taxes  with a SALT cap, imagine how high they will raise them without it?  There is a price to be paid from high State and local taxes. In  truth, these are terrific States with dynamic economies and really good  people. But according to MoneyWise.com, the four States Americans are  fleeing from the most are New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and  Illinois.  Millennials, young people, are doing the same, but you can add  California to that list. These young people love their States, with  good reason, but they just can't see a future there with high taxes and  impossibly high costs.  In the end, though, why should low-tax States be forced, through the  tax code, to subsidize high-tax States?  Why should a farmer in Nebraska subsidize a banker in Manhattan?  Why should a single mom in New Jersey or a janitor in a building who  doesn't itemize their taxes subsidize the billionaire in the penthouse  who does?  LeBron James, an iconic athlete, legendary really, of the Lakers, he  will receive an estimated $2.4 million tax break next year because of  the Democrats' bill, but the janitor and the beer vendor in Staples  Center, they get nothing.  Gerrit Cole, a former Astros, is going to the Yankees as their new  ace. He will get an estimated $850,000 next year, but that parking lot  attendant at Yankee Stadium gets nothing.  That is what this bill does, because more than half of the SALT  deduction goes to millionaire and billionaire households.  Madam Speaker, the SALT cap of $10,000 is higher than the national  average of SALT deductions, and because of Republican lawmakers in  high-tax States, who weighed in aggressively during tax reform, it can  be used for property, sales, or income taxes. And the AMT, which is  worth up to $10,000 in tax breaks, was eliminated.  Thanks to pro-growth tax reform, our U.S. economy has roared into  gear as the most competitive economy on the planet, with the lowest  unemployment in half a century, paychecks increasing the fastest in  more than a decade, wage growth outpacing inflation by $1,000 a year  for average working families, American manufacturing is back, and we  have a million more job openings than workers.  America is once again a land of opportunity.  Placing a cap on the SALT deduction to let middle-class families--not  the wealthy--keep more of what they earned is a crucial component of  achieving this economic victory for American workers and their  families.  That old, broken, regressive SALT tax break for the wealthy has no  place in a fair, modern tax code, and the positive growth in America  since its removal is a clear demonstration of that fact.  One final thing: We often hear that limiting the SALT deduction is  double-taxation and unconstitutional. The courts and tax policy experts  have debunked these myths.  We hear a lot about moocher States, but the only moochers in this  debate are the State and local politicians who think it is their money,  and they are mooching off the backs of hardworking families and small  businesses in high-tax States.  I know my Democrat colleagues are sincere in this effort. But with  this bill, you have officially claimed the mantel ``party of the  rich.''  Madam Speaker, I strongly urge all my colleagues to vote ``no'' on  this bill.  And, again, I offer this: Republicans are committed to working with  Democrats to make our tax code even more competitive, to make our  economy even stronger, and to never stop working to help the little guy  in the middle class, and giving tax breaks to billionaires, encouraging  States to raise their taxes even more is not the way to do it.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    "
43,Anthony Brindisi,2.034342050552368,D,brindisi,brindisi," Mr. BRINDISI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of "", H.R. 7105, "".  I am proud that this bill includes the Chuck Osier Burial Benefits  Act, which would require the VA to furnish an urn or a plaque if a  deceased eligible veteran was not interred in a traditional cemetery.  All veterans deserve to be honored for their service, regardless of how  their families choose to lay them to rest.  It is named in honor of Chuck Osier, an Air Force veteran from  Sherrill, New York, who passed away in 2015. Because Chuck was not  interred in a traditional cemetery, his family could not honor him with  a VA-furnished marker.  His widow, Donna, has been working with Members of Congress from  central New York for years to get this fixed. I am proud to stand here  for Chuck and Donna and finally get this bill passed.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation for our Nation's veterans and their families.  Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), my good friend, my neighbor just  north of me in Kentucky, and a very, very prominent member of the  Veterans' Affairs Committee.    "
44,Mo Brooks,0.08946122229099274,R,brooks,brooks," Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, that was outstanding.  And to my dear friend and colleague, best to you in retirement and in  your next chapter of life. You have an amazing family; you have a  passion for our country. Thank you for reminding us all of the great  history of this country. And what an amazing country we are both proud  to be born in and lucky to be born in. So I wish you well.  Mr. Speaker, fellow Members of Congress, my dedicated staff past and  present, my family and friends, and most importantly to the Hoosiers of  the Fifth District of Indiana: I stand before you today at the end of  an incredibly challenging year, at the close of a tumultuous decade,  and in the final days of my tenure as a Member of this esteemed body.  When I decided to run for Congress in 2011, it was because I wanted  to make a difference in my community and my country. I believed that  despite the dysfunction that did and does dominate the headlines, I  could get things done for my home State of Indiana and my fellow  Hoosiers.  Above all, I wanted to restore confidence in Congress, to reassure  people that our government can and does do enormous good, that their  elected representatives are dedicated public servants who, while still  human, wake up each day committed to ensuring a brighter future for  every American, where the opportunity to thrive is not limited to some,  but afforded to all.  {time} 2030  How do you go about rebuilding trust and faith with some 328 million  people? We still have a long way to go. Congressional approval ratings  continue to hover in the teens and twenties.  But over the course of my 8 years here, I have identified four steps  I believe can and will go a long way to restoring public trust and  faith in Congress.  The first sounds relatively simple. We just need to do the work. As  every Member of this esteemed body knows, in practice, making an idea  into an effective law takes careful planning, hours of learning,  listening to the experts, deep discussions, debates with constituents,  and colleagues across the political spectrum, not to mention actually  writing the legislation and earning the votes to get it signed into law  by the President.  These days, it seems like ideas we can all get behind are few and far  between. Wherever you look, it is hard not to see the deep divisions in  our country, along party lines to be sure, but also along racial,  socioeconomic, gender, geographic, and religious lines as well.  Following a very contentious election, those divisions are on full  display, for better or for worse. It is easy to point out the problems  we face, but it is the difficult, humbling work to set aside our  differences, to roll up our sleeves, and to focus on finding solutions.  My time in Congress has taught me that it is work worth doing.  Some of the most important work that I have been involved in here has  been in response to the number of Americans lost to opioid overdoses  each day that is still alarmingly high and being pushed higher by the  pandemic.  I am especially proud to have been a part of getting a comprehensive  piece of legislation passed to work against every facet of the heroin  opioid crisis. [["", Page , H7034, ] From prevention and education, to treatment and recovery, to getting  overdose reversal drugs into the hands of first responders, and  supporting law enforcement in their fight against illicit drugs, I am  even prouder that the legislation that was ultimately signed into law  incorporated hundreds of smart solutions and proposals from individual  Members of Congress from across the country and the political spectrum.  The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act epitomizes the way our  government can and should work for us. I have worked hard to ensure  that I approach each day ready to collaborate, debate, and work  alongside my colleagues, regardless of party, and to really address the  challenges facing our country.  I believe government's first priority is security, keeping its  citizens safe, the people directly responsible for ensuring our  security, our brave servicemen and -women. It is impossible to  overstate my admiration and gratitude for the difficult work they do,  the sacrifices they and their families make for our safety, and their  willingness to pay the ultimate price for our freedom.  I was lucky enough to be a part of a delegation led by retiring  Members Representatives Martha Roby and Susan Davis to Afghanistan,  Iraq, and Jordan to thank moms for serving away from their families on  Mother's Day. These were among the most meaningful moments of my  congressional career. They reinforced my belief that Congress' top job  is to support our troops and our diplomats, to give them the tools they  need to perform their duty and to never forget the sacrifice they have  made and will continue to make for our country.  While contentious and difficult, my work on the Select Committee on  Benghazi was, at its core, to make sure we do a better job of  protecting our diplomats and Americans serving overseas. They deserve  to know that we are doing everything in our power to keep them safe  while they protect our interests and defend our Nation abroad.  At home, it is our first responders who are on the front lines of  ensuring our safety and upholding the rule of law. Because I worked  closely with our partners in law enforcement, first as a deputy mayor  in Indianapolis and later as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of  Indiana, I wanted to be a voice for law enforcement in Congress. I saw  their dedication and the sacrifices they and their families make.  There were and are areas where we can make both our citizens and our  first responders safer.  Following the Boston Marathon bombing, I worked to help first  responders use social media as an effective tool for disaster response.  Later, my fellow Hoosiers, Senators Young and Donnelly, and a  bipartisan group of my colleagues in the House led efforts to give  first responders critical access to mental health support to manage the  trauma inherent in their day-to-day work.  Today, law enforcement needs our support more than ever, even as we  look for ways to ensure our laws are enforced justly and fairly.  Time and time again during my congressional career, we found areas of  agreement, no matter how small, where positive change can be made for  our fellow citizens. And sometimes we go big. We came together to pass  the 21st Century Cures Act led by Representative Fred Upton and  Representative Diana DeGette from Colorado, which speeds up the  research, development, and deploying of lifesaving medicines,  treatments, and, yes, vaccines.  I joined breast cancer survivor Representative Wasserman Schultz to  ensure young women can access lifesaving mammograms and detect breast  cancer early.  Beyond the big headlines about gridlock and dysfunction, there is  good, meaningful work being done on Capitol Hill, but none of it is  done alone.  To my beloved friends and family, ``thank you'' doesn't begin to  cover it. You have kept me grounded in purpose, honest and strong. Your  unwavering support and love and laughter have made the hard days easier  and the happy days more joyful.  My husband, David, and my children, Jessica and Connor, having you by  my side every step of the way has made all the difference. I love you  very much and couldn't be prouder of all that you have accomplished in  the last 8 years.  To the rest of my family and friends at home and across the country,  thank you for being my champions, my cheerleaders, and, above all, for  walking alongside me even during the difficult parts of this journey.  You were the first volunteers for my campaign and you always have my  back. I look forward to more time spent with all of you in the months  and years to come.  To my dedicated team, past and present, some of whom have been with  me since the beginning of this wild ride, I share every accomplishment  and every accolade with you. It is hard to find people with whom you  can share a passion and a purpose, let alone a few laughs and tears  along the way.  From the day I announced my candidacy to the day we turn off the  lights, there are countless individuals who have contributed to my work  with integrity and grit and who served the Fifth District honorably. We  have become a family.  While working side by side, we have celebrated life's great joys-- weddings, babies, first grandchildren--and cheered one another on  during periods of transition--new jobs, pursuing graduate degrees,  first homes, and cross-country moves. And we have grieved together  during life's inevitable sorrows, mourning friends and family members  taken too soon, including Judy Christofolis, who died this past spring  after a long battle with breast cancer.  Through it all, I have been lucky to have been surrounded by smart  people who are willing to work late nights and early mornings to  crisscross the Fifth District to hear directly from our constituents,  to learn and grow alongside, and craft effective legislation that  really fixes problems for people.  I am proud of all the work we have done together, and I am looking  forward to cheering each of you on during all the exciting twists and  turns that are yet to come in your life's journey.  To my colleagues, most of whom I now call friends, particularly the  Indiana delegation, my brothers and sister Hoosiers, thank you for your  collaboration, your intelligence, your patriotism, and your service. It  is a privilege to work with each of you, and I am grateful for all the  opportunities we had to tackle big problems together.  I want to especially recognize my esteemed congressional mentors,  Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who believed in me and supported  me in my very first primary; former Speaker John Boehner, who gave me  many opportunities to lead and make a difference; Representative Fred  Upton and Representative Greg Walden, who were amazing leaders on the  House Energy and Commerce Committee; and to our Republican leadership  team, who I have become very close to, Leader Kevin McCarthy, Whip  Steve Scalise, and Conference Chair Liz Cheney.  They approached their difficult jobs with enthusiasm, integrity, and  vision. Thank you for your encouragement, counsel, and wisdom, and for  all of our staffs.  Finally, to the people of the Fifth District, it has been the great  honor of my life to serve as your voice in Congress, your advocate, for  the last 8 years.  I would like to especially recognize the young people who  participated in my youth advisory groups, the thousands of constituents  who visited with me at Connect With Your Congresswoman events, the  educators and business leaders who made our Connecting Careers and  Classroom events such a success. You make me proud to be a Hoosier.  That brings me to my second step in rebuilding confidence in  Congress. We must remain closely connected, more closely than ever  before, to our home States, our communities, and the people we  represent. The laws we pass in Congress are focused on the national  level, but my first priority is and always has been serving the people  of the Fifth.  In 8 years, we worked with more than 4,500 constituents to help them  navigate government, resolve issues with Federal agencies like the  Veterans Administration, Medicare, assist with stalled international  adoptions, and even bring terrorists to justice for the murder of a  young Hoosier.  We worked with communities to support critical grants and initiatives  that are making the Fifth District of Indiana an even greater place to  live, work, [["", Page , H7035, ] and grow. In Anderson, after years of effort, we secured support for  the 8th Street Bridge, a critical transportation link downtown.  We commemorated the 50th anniversary of Robert Kennedy's speech  following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. I worked  with my fellow Hoosier Representative Andre Carson and Senators Young  and Donnelly to establish the Landmark for Peace Memorial in  Indianapolis as part of the African American Civil Rights Network.  It was the honor of a lifetime to be with the late civil rights icon  and my friend, Representative John Lewis, in Indiana to celebrate that  50 years of struggle and progress.  And, yes, we grieved with the city of Noblesville following a tragic  school shooting, but we honored the heroes, the teachers, the nurses,  and the school police officers who saved lives that day.  Yes, the job is difficult. But sometimes, this job is just fun.  Whether it is calling a brilliant young Hoosier to tell them they  received an appointment to attend a military academy, or whether we  have traveled the district and learned how puzzles are made at a  factory in Tipton, or we joined Indiana Wesleyan University students in  Marion to celebrate three national sports titles and their 100th  anniversary.  At Launch Fishers and zWorks in Zionsville, we saw the latest and  cutting-edge technology and met entrepreneurs on the cusp of the next  great idea.  It wouldn't be a trip home without mentioning the food, whether it  was enjoying the waffles after ringing the bell to open the farmers  market in my hometown of Carmel or grabbing a bite at the Indiana State  Fair Midway.  I can't thank all the farmers enough across the Fifth District for  opening their farms to me and helping me understand all the work that  goes into providing the food on our tables, both at home and around the  world.  I even got to try my hand at a few jobs, like spending a day as a UPS  driver in suburban Indianapolis.  But it is the conversations with the young Hoosiers that gave me so  much hope. I will never forget visiting the JROTC program at Blackford  High School and celebrating Veterans Day with them. The adventures  across the district and the warm welcomes I received will stay with me  for the rest of my life.  Beyond the job and remaining rooted in our districts, the third way  we can restore confidence in Congress is to take a hard look at  ourselves in the mirror to ensure that Congress truly embodies the  diversity that makes our Nation strong and to commit to a culture of  continuous improvement.  When my close friend, Representative Jackie Walorski, who is one of  my best friends here--we were elected in 2012--we were the first  Republican women to represent the State of Indiana in Washington, D.C.,  in 50 years. Representative Cecil Harden had come before us.  We joined a small, but mighty, group of women in the House who,  despite our political differences, agreed that Congress needed more  women. And last year, I took the baton from my dear friends,  Representative Elise Stefanik and Ann Wagner before her, and we led  Republican efforts to recruit more women and more people of color to  run for Congress.  This fall, more Republican women ran and won than ever before. Our  work must continue on both sides of the aisle if Congress is to truly  reflect the diversity of our country. It is one of the reasons I agreed  to co-chair the Bipartisan Women's Caucus with Representative Lois  Frankel.  Together, we led efforts to improve access to school around the globe  for girls. We worked to recognize the female leaders who came before  us, from the 100th anniversary of the first woman to serve in Congress,  Jeannette Rankin, to the annual Memorial Day service where we honor our  female veterans.  Importantly, we acted on the findings of the Indianapolis Star  investigation into sexual abuse of young Olympic hopefuls, to protect  young athletes from harm and to ensure that victims have access to  justice, and we did so across party lines.  Nowhere was bipartisanship more at work, though, than during my  service, first as a Member and then as chairwoman of the House Ethics  Committee. Holding that gavel not only made me the first Hoosier woman  to chair a congressional committee, but it was an unprecedented  opportunity to ensure transparency, accountability, access, and justice  in Congress. Little did I know that I would preside over the committee  at the same time that the #MeToo movement shone a light on the  pervasive problem of sexual harassment in our society and in our  government.  Like many of you, my good friend and the ranking member Ted Deutch  and I were shocked to learn that millions of dollars in settlements had  been paid by Congress to victims of sexual assault. Over the next year,  a bipartisan group of Members worked to reform the Congressional  Accountability Act to make it easier for victims to report sexual  harassment and to make sure that financial settlements aren't paid by  Members of Congress and that they must be disclosed to the public.  There is still so much work to be done, but I have to tell you, at  the end of my service here in Congress, the Select Committee on the  Modernization of Congress gives me much hope. I have been a proud  member of that committee. We recently published 97 bipartisan  recommendations focused on making Congress work more efficiently and  transparently and to be more responsive and accessible to the American  people.  A quarter of our recommendations have already been enacted, and I  hope the rest will soon follow, because if we are to debate 21st  century issues, we must bring our policies, technology, staff, and  communications into the modern age.  So, I strongly encourage and urge my colleagues and the new Members  of Congress to first read our report and then take up the select  committee's recommendations and continue the hard work. I want to thank  Representatives Kilmer and Graves for their leadership.  That brings me to my fourth and final step of rebuilding trust and  faith in Congress: ensuring we are looking ahead, beyond the most  pressing challenges of today, to those on the horizon.  Following the recession in 2009, many Americans were out of work.  Still more were underemployed. Our economy was and is moving quickly to  Industry 5.0 where careers in tech, connected devices, and AI become  the norm.  {time} 2045  If we aren't careful, this future will leave many of our fellow  citizens behind.  To that end, we have passed legislation to improve training and  workforce programs to retrain and deploy Americans who are out of work,  to expand 5G networks and rural broadband so more people can  participate in this industrial revolution and provide clear guardrails  for the technology industry to continue its rapid growth, while  offering better protection for our personal information, preventing  cyber threats and attacks.  Our world is changing fast, and Congress must keep up. When former  Representative Mike Rogers approached me about continuing his work to  strengthen our national biodefense, I knew it was important work.  Alongside my incredible partner who became a very dear friend,  Representative Anna Eshoo and I began engaging again in the biodefense  efforts that have been going on since the early 2000s, the  reauthorization of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act. It  was signed into law in 2019.  This legislation represents years of bipartisan collaboration and  thoughtful input from medical and public health preparedness and  response leaders. It helped bolster our response to natural disasters  and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats.  When it was passed, I thought the greatest threats we faced were from  terrorist organizations like ISIS using chemical or biological weapons  in their attack, which are still a significant concern today. But  little did I realize that our Nation--our world--was on the verge of a  pandemic that would grind business, travel, and life as we knew it to a  halt.  I am glad we passed PAHPA when we did, and I know we must do better  in [["", Page , H7036, ] the future. When the next novel virus or biological unforeseen event  occurs, Americans will expect more from this institution. We can learn  from our successes and failures over the last 9 months and in the  months to come as we look toward a COVID-19 vaccine and, ultimately, a  return to our normal pace of life. We know some things will never be  the same.  Change must happen in our country to make good on our founding  promise that all people are created equal and that our rights to life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are protected. How we do that is  a matter great debate playing out in our streets in protests, on social  media, around dinner tables, and in headlines.  It seems like there is no good solution and no way forward. It is up  to us--to every American--to forge a path together and to mend the  fissures that are breaking apart our Nation and our democracy.  I have spent the last 8 years engaged in this work day in and day  out. It is work I will continue for the rest of my life because the  truth is we have far more in common than we don't.  We are up to this task. I believe in the American spirit, in the  power of our ingenuity, and in the strength of our resolve.  We will get through these difficult days. This pandemic will end. We  will get Americans and businesses back to work and school.  We will overcome the scourge of racism and prejudice.  We will restore trust and confidence in our government and in  Congress.  We will once again see this Chamber full of big ideas aimed at  ensuring the American Dream is within reach for everyone.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the very last time, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    "
45,Mo Brooks,0.08946122229099274,R,brooks,brooks," Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, this is my eighth speech in a  series on voter fraud, election theft, and the Presidential election.  There are three major flaws in America's elections that socialist  Democrats exploit to steal elections.  First, voting by illegal aliens and other noncitizens is rampant  because socialist Democrats made it illegal to require proof of  citizenship when illegal aliens and other noncitizens demand to be  registered to vote. In 2020, hundreds of thousands, and more likely  millions, of illegal aliens and other noncitizens legally voted for Joe  Biden after he promised them amnesty and citizenship if he is elected  President.  Second, vote-by-mail schemes are both horribly prone to voter fraud  and are illegal because they violate Article I, Section 4 of the  Constitution and Congress' ensuing designation, with minor exceptions,  of one 24-hour day as the election day during which citizens can vote.  Yet, in 2020, socialist Democrats foisted vote-by-mail schemes on  America in order to more easily engage in voter fraud and election  theft.  Third, the lack of photo ID requirements makes it easier for paid  socialist Democrat election thieves to steal elections with voter  impersonators. While socialist Democrats and the fake news media  repeatedly and falsely claim there was no voter fraud in 2020, what is  most startling is this: America was warned 15 years ago that this would  happen.  In 2005, a bipartisan Commission on Federal Election Reform co- chaired by Democrat President Jimmy Carter and Reagan White House Chief  of Staff James Baker issued a 105-page report specifically warning  about the very same systemic flaws the socialist Democrats used in 2020  to steal elections. The commission report warns: ``Elections are the  heart of democracy. If elections are defective, the entire democratic  system is at risk.''  Concerning noncitizen voting, the commission warned of a growing  noncitizen voting threat, citing 784 noncitizen votes in a contested  California congressional race. The commission recommended that ``all  States should use their best efforts to obtain proof of citizenship  before registering voters.''  Of course, that means repealing the socialist Democrat law that makes  it illegal for voter registrars to require proof of citizenship when  illegal aliens and other noncitizens demand to be registered to vote.  Concerning vote-by-mail schemes, the commission warned that vote by  mail is ``likely to increase the risks of fraud and of contested  elections,'' adding that it remains ``the largest source of potential  voter fraud'' because it is ``vulnerable to abuse in several ways.  Blank ballots mailed to the wrong address or to large residential  buildings might get intercepted. . . . Vote buying schemes are far more  difficult to detect when citizens vote by mail.''  The commission recommended minimizing voting by mail.  On voter ID, the commission warned that the lack of photo ID opens  the door to voter fraud and strongly recommended a photo ID requirement  for voters, noting that ``photo IDs currently are needed to board a  plane, enter Federal buildings, and cash a check. Voting is equally  important,'' and that ``voters in nearly 100 democracies use a photo  identification card without fear of infringement on their rights.''  The commission recommended that ``citizens should identify themselves  as the correct person on the registration list when they vote.'' The  problem ``is not the magnitude of the fraud. In close or disputed  elections, and there are many, a small amount of fraud could make the  margin of difference.''  How prophetic.  Mr. Speaker, America's republic is only as good as its election  system. On January 6, 2021, I have a choice. I can ignore truth,  surrender to socialism, and accept electoral college submissions from  States with election systems so badly flawed as to render their vote  submissions unreliable, untrustworthy, and unworthy of acceptance. Or I  can fight for America and move to reject them.  I can't speak for anyone else, but as for me, Mo Brooks from  Alabama's Fifth Congressional District, I choose to fight for America.    "
46,Susan Brooks,0.05964081361889839,R,brooks,brooks," Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, that was outstanding.  And to my dear friend and colleague, best to you in retirement and in  your next chapter of life. You have an amazing family; you have a  passion for our country. Thank you for reminding us all of the great  history of this country. And what an amazing country we are both proud  to be born in and lucky to be born in. So I wish you well.  Mr. Speaker, fellow Members of Congress, my dedicated staff past and  present, my family and friends, and most importantly to the Hoosiers of  the Fifth District of Indiana: I stand before you today at the end of  an incredibly challenging year, at the close of a tumultuous decade,  and in the final days of my tenure as a Member of this esteemed body.  When I decided to run for Congress in 2011, it was because I wanted  to make a difference in my community and my country. I believed that  despite the dysfunction that did and does dominate the headlines, I  could get things done for my home State of Indiana and my fellow  Hoosiers.  Above all, I wanted to restore confidence in Congress, to reassure  people that our government can and does do enormous good, that their  elected representatives are dedicated public servants who, while still  human, wake up each day committed to ensuring a brighter future for  every American, where the opportunity to thrive is not limited to some,  but afforded to all.  {time} 2030  How do you go about rebuilding trust and faith with some 328 million  people? We still have a long way to go. Congressional approval ratings  continue to hover in the teens and twenties.  But over the course of my 8 years here, I have identified four steps  I believe can and will go a long way to restoring public trust and  faith in Congress.  The first sounds relatively simple. We just need to do the work. As  every Member of this esteemed body knows, in practice, making an idea  into an effective law takes careful planning, hours of learning,  listening to the experts, deep discussions, debates with constituents,  and colleagues across the political spectrum, not to mention actually  writing the legislation and earning the votes to get it signed into law  by the President.  These days, it seems like ideas we can all get behind are few and far  between. Wherever you look, it is hard not to see the deep divisions in  our country, along party lines to be sure, but also along racial,  socioeconomic, gender, geographic, and religious lines as well.  Following a very contentious election, those divisions are on full  display, for better or for worse. It is easy to point out the problems  we face, but it is the difficult, humbling work to set aside our  differences, to roll up our sleeves, and to focus on finding solutions.  My time in Congress has taught me that it is work worth doing.  Some of the most important work that I have been involved in here has  been in response to the number of Americans lost to opioid overdoses  each day that is still alarmingly high and being pushed higher by the  pandemic.  I am especially proud to have been a part of getting a comprehensive  piece of legislation passed to work against every facet of the heroin  opioid crisis. [["", Page , H7034, ] From prevention and education, to treatment and recovery, to getting  overdose reversal drugs into the hands of first responders, and  supporting law enforcement in their fight against illicit drugs, I am  even prouder that the legislation that was ultimately signed into law  incorporated hundreds of smart solutions and proposals from individual  Members of Congress from across the country and the political spectrum.  The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act epitomizes the way our  government can and should work for us. I have worked hard to ensure  that I approach each day ready to collaborate, debate, and work  alongside my colleagues, regardless of party, and to really address the  challenges facing our country.  I believe government's first priority is security, keeping its  citizens safe, the people directly responsible for ensuring our  security, our brave servicemen and -women. It is impossible to  overstate my admiration and gratitude for the difficult work they do,  the sacrifices they and their families make for our safety, and their  willingness to pay the ultimate price for our freedom.  I was lucky enough to be a part of a delegation led by retiring  Members Representatives Martha Roby and Susan Davis to Afghanistan,  Iraq, and Jordan to thank moms for serving away from their families on  Mother's Day. These were among the most meaningful moments of my  congressional career. They reinforced my belief that Congress' top job  is to support our troops and our diplomats, to give them the tools they  need to perform their duty and to never forget the sacrifice they have  made and will continue to make for our country.  While contentious and difficult, my work on the Select Committee on  Benghazi was, at its core, to make sure we do a better job of  protecting our diplomats and Americans serving overseas. They deserve  to know that we are doing everything in our power to keep them safe  while they protect our interests and defend our Nation abroad.  At home, it is our first responders who are on the front lines of  ensuring our safety and upholding the rule of law. Because I worked  closely with our partners in law enforcement, first as a deputy mayor  in Indianapolis and later as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of  Indiana, I wanted to be a voice for law enforcement in Congress. I saw  their dedication and the sacrifices they and their families make.  There were and are areas where we can make both our citizens and our  first responders safer.  Following the Boston Marathon bombing, I worked to help first  responders use social media as an effective tool for disaster response.  Later, my fellow Hoosiers, Senators Young and Donnelly, and a  bipartisan group of my colleagues in the House led efforts to give  first responders critical access to mental health support to manage the  trauma inherent in their day-to-day work.  Today, law enforcement needs our support more than ever, even as we  look for ways to ensure our laws are enforced justly and fairly.  Time and time again during my congressional career, we found areas of  agreement, no matter how small, where positive change can be made for  our fellow citizens. And sometimes we go big. We came together to pass  the 21st Century Cures Act led by Representative Fred Upton and  Representative Diana DeGette from Colorado, which speeds up the  research, development, and deploying of lifesaving medicines,  treatments, and, yes, vaccines.  I joined breast cancer survivor Representative Wasserman Schultz to  ensure young women can access lifesaving mammograms and detect breast  cancer early.  Beyond the big headlines about gridlock and dysfunction, there is  good, meaningful work being done on Capitol Hill, but none of it is  done alone.  To my beloved friends and family, ``thank you'' doesn't begin to  cover it. You have kept me grounded in purpose, honest and strong. Your  unwavering support and love and laughter have made the hard days easier  and the happy days more joyful.  My husband, David, and my children, Jessica and Connor, having you by  my side every step of the way has made all the difference. I love you  very much and couldn't be prouder of all that you have accomplished in  the last 8 years.

It is hard to find people with whom you  can share a passion and a purpose, let alone a few laughs and tears  along the way.  From the day I announced my candidacy to the day we turn off the  lights, there are countless individuals who have contributed to my work  with integrity and grit and who served the Fifth District honorably. We  have become a family.  While working side by side, we have celebrated life's great joys-- weddings, babies, first grandchildren--and cheered one another on  during periods of transition--new jobs, pursuing graduate degrees,  first homes, and cross-country moves. And we have grieved together  during life's inevitable sorrows, mourning friends and family members  taken too soon, including Judy Christofolis, who died this past spring  after a long battle with breast cancer.  Through it all, I have been lucky to have been surrounded by smart  people who are willing to work late nights and early mornings to  crisscross the Fifth District to hear directly from our constituents,  to learn and grow alongside, and craft effective legislation that  really fixes problems for people.  I am proud of all the work we have done together, and I am looking  forward to cheering each of you on during all the exciting twists and  turns that are yet to come in your life's journey.

I want to especially recognize my esteemed congressional mentors,  Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who believed in me and supported  me in my very first primary; former Speaker John Boehner, who gave me  many opportunities to lead and make a difference; Representative Fred  Upton and Representative Greg Walden, who were amazing leaders on the  House Energy and Commerce Committee; and to our Republican leadership  team, who I have become very close to, Leader Kevin McCarthy, Whip  Steve Scalise, and Conference Chair Liz Cheney.

Little did I know that I would preside over the committee  at the same time that the #MeToo movement shone a light on the  pervasive problem of sexual harassment in our society and in our  government.  Like many of you, my good friend and the ranking member Ted Deutch  and I were shocked to learn that millions of dollars in settlements had  been paid by Congress to victims of sexual assault. Over the next year,  a bipartisan group of Members worked to reform the Congressional  Accountability Act to make it easier for victims to report sexual  harassment and to make sure that financial settlements aren't paid by  Members of Congress and that they must be disclosed to the public.  There is still so much work to be done, but I have to tell you, at  the end of my service here in Congress, the Select Committee on the  Modernization of Congress gives me much hope. I have been a proud  member of that committee. We recently published 97 bipartisan  recommendations focused on making Congress work more efficiently and  transparently and to be more responsive and accessible to the American  people.  A quarter of our recommendations have already been enacted, and I  hope the rest will soon follow, because if we are to debate 21st  century issues, we must bring our policies, technology, staff, and  communications into the modern age.  So, I strongly encourage and urge my colleagues and the new Members  of Congress to first read our report and then take up the select  committee's recommendations and continue the hard work. I want to thank  Representatives Kilmer and Graves for their leadership.  That brings me to my fourth and final step of rebuilding trust and  faith in Congress: ensuring we are looking ahead, beyond the most  pressing challenges of today, to those on the horizon.  Following the recession in 2009, many Americans were out of work.  Still more were underemployed. Our economy was and is moving quickly to  Industry 5.0 where careers in tech, connected devices, and AI become  the norm.  {time} 2045  If we aren't careful, this future will leave many of our fellow  citizens behind.  To that end, we have passed legislation to improve training and  workforce programs to retrain and deploy Americans who are out of work,  to expand 5G networks and rural broadband so more people can  participate in this industrial revolution and provide clear guardrails  for the technology industry to continue its rapid growth, while  offering better protection for our personal information, preventing  cyber threats and attacks.  Our world is changing fast, and Congress must keep up. When former  Representative Mike Rogers approached me about continuing his work to  strengthen our national biodefense, I knew it was important work.  Alongside my incredible partner who became a very dear friend,  Representative Anna Eshoo and I began engaging again in the biodefense  efforts that have been going on since the early 2000s, the  reauthorization of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act. It  was signed into law in 2019.  This legislation represents years of bipartisan collaboration and  thoughtful input from medical and public health preparedness and  response leaders. It helped bolster our response to natural disasters  and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats.  When it was passed, I thought the greatest threats we faced were from  terrorist organizations like ISIS using chemical or biological weapons  in their attack, which are still a significant concern today. But  little did I realize that our Nation--our world--was on the verge of a  pandemic that would grind business, travel, and life as we knew it to a  halt.  I am glad we passed PAHPA when we did, and I know we must do better  in [["", Page , H7036, ] the future. When the next novel virus or biological unforeseen event  occurs, Americans will expect more from this institution. We can learn  from our successes and failures over the last 9 months and in the  months to come as we look toward a COVID-19 vaccine and, ultimately, a  return to our normal pace of life. We know some things will never be  the same.  Change must happen in our country to make good on our founding  promise that all people are created equal and that our rights to life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are protected. How we do that is  a matter great debate playing out in our streets in protests, on social  media, around dinner tables, and in headlines.  It seems like there is no good solution and no way forward. It is up  to us--to every American--to forge a path together and to mend the  fissures that are breaking apart our Nation and our democracy.  I have spent the last 8 years engaged in this work day in and day  out. It is work I will continue for the rest of my life because the  truth is we have far more in common than we don't.  We are up to this task. I believe in the American spirit, in the  power of our ingenuity, and in the strength of our resolve.  We will get through these difficult days. This pandemic will end. We  will get Americans and businesses back to work and school.  We will overcome the scourge of racism and prejudice.  We will restore trust and confidence in our government and in  Congress.  We will once again see this Chamber full of big ideas aimed at  ensuring the American Dream is within reach for everyone.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the very last time, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    "
47,Susan Brooks,0.05964081361889839,R,brooks,brooks," Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, this is my eighth speech in a  series on voter fraud, election theft, and the Presidential election.  There are three major flaws in America's elections that socialist  Democrats exploit to steal elections.  First, voting by illegal aliens and other noncitizens is rampant  because socialist Democrats made it illegal to require proof of  citizenship when illegal aliens and other noncitizens demand to be  registered to vote. In 2020, hundreds of thousands, and more likely  millions, of illegal aliens and other noncitizens legally voted for Joe  Biden after he promised them amnesty and citizenship if he is elected  President.  Second, vote-by-mail schemes are both horribly prone to voter fraud  and are illegal because they violate Article I, Section 4 of the  Constitution and Congress' ensuing designation, with minor exceptions,  of one 24-hour day as the election day during which citizens can vote.  Yet, in 2020, socialist Democrats foisted vote-by-mail schemes on  America in order to more easily engage in voter fraud and election  theft.  Third, the lack of photo ID requirements makes it easier for paid  socialist Democrat election thieves to steal elections with voter  impersonators. While socialist Democrats and the fake news media  repeatedly and falsely claim there was no voter fraud in 2020, what is  most startling is this: America was warned 15 years ago that this would  happen.  In 2005, a bipartisan Commission on Federal Election Reform co- chaired by Democrat President Jimmy Carter and Reagan White House Chief  of Staff James Baker issued a 105-page report specifically warning  about the very same systemic flaws the socialist Democrats used in 2020  to steal elections. The commission report warns: ``Elections are the  heart of democracy. If elections are defective, the entire democratic  system is at risk.''  Concerning noncitizen voting, the commission warned of a growing  noncitizen voting threat, citing 784 noncitizen votes in a contested  California congressional race. The commission recommended that ``all  States should use their best efforts to obtain proof of citizenship  before registering voters.''  Of course, that means repealing the socialist Democrat law that makes  it illegal for voter registrars to require proof of citizenship when  illegal aliens and other noncitizens demand to be registered to vote.  Concerning vote-by-mail schemes, the commission warned that vote by  mail is ``likely to increase the risks of fraud and of contested  elections,'' adding that it remains ``the largest source of potential  voter fraud'' because it is ``vulnerable to abuse in several ways.  Blank ballots mailed to the wrong address or to large residential  buildings might get intercepted. . . . Vote buying schemes are far more  difficult to detect when citizens vote by mail.''  The commission recommended minimizing voting by mail.  On voter ID, the commission warned that the lack of photo ID opens  the door to voter fraud and strongly recommended a photo ID requirement  for voters, noting that ``photo IDs currently are needed to board a  plane, enter Federal buildings, and cash a check. Voting is equally  important,'' and that ``voters in nearly 100 democracies use a photo  identification card without fear of infringement on their rights.''  The commission recommended that ``citizens should identify themselves  as the correct person on the registration list when they vote.'' The  problem ``is not the magnitude of the fraud. In close or disputed  elections, and there are many, a small amount of fraud could make the  margin of difference.''  How prophetic.  Mr. Speaker, America's republic is only as good as its election  system. On January 6, 2021, I have a choice. I can ignore truth,  surrender to socialism, and accept electoral college submissions from  States with election systems so badly flawed as to render their vote  submissions unreliable, untrustworthy, and unworthy of acceptance. Or I  can fight for America and move to reject them.  I can't speak for anyone else, but as for me, Mo Brooks from  Alabama's Fifth Congressional District, I choose to fight for America.    "
48,Anthony Brown,0.9607285261154175,D,brown,brown," Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Robert Greenstein, founder and president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, for his work over nearly four decades, fighting for a more just and equal society. Bob founded CBPP in 1981 to push for policies that expand opportunity for the lowest income children and families, and ensure that this country's prosperity is shared with the workers who create it, not just the wealthiest CEOs and the largest corporations. He built CBPP from the ground up and transformed it from a tiny organization with a shoestring budget to one of the most influential policy shapers in the country. Under Bob's leadership, CBPP combined in-depth analysis and research with clear-headed strategy to drive the debate and deliver results. We worked together to spearhead efforts to permanently expand the earned income tax credit and child tax credit in 2015, and Bob was vital to our success. It is probably the most important thing we have done to life people out of poverty in the last 25 years, and it could not have happened without Bob's leadership on this issue, stretching back decades. Of course it is not only tax credits; from passing the Affordable Care Act to strengthening SNAP, from protecting and expanding Medicaid, to fighting for more affordable housing, Bob's work at CBPP has meant that millions of ordinary Americans have more food on the table, more money in their pockets, and a little more economic security. Over his career he has touched so many lives, and he has so much to be proud of. We know we have a lot more work to do, and while Bob has earned his retirement, I have faith that he will continue to be a force for the progressive change that our country needs.<bullet>   "
49,Anthony Brown,0.9607285261154175,D,brown,brown," Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the exemplary  service of my now former chief of staff, Maia Hunt Estes.  Maia has been an indispensable adviser and confidante to me for more  than a decade, including my first days in Congress and during my tenure  as Maryland's Lieutenant Governor. It is fair to say that I wouldn't be  here today without her extraordinary counsel.  I could count on Maia day and night to get the job done. Maia brought  an unmatched level of commitment to every issue, every challenge, every  single fight, every constituent case, no matter how big or small.  Throughout our time together, Maia has provided strategic advice and  clear-eyed leadership on national security and defense, transportation  and infrastructure.  Maia served as my key liaison to the Congressional Black Caucus and  Democratic leadership on core issues to me and the people of Maryland.  Her deep understanding of the issues, candid advice, insightful  opinions, and passionate drive for serving others has helped me deliver  for my State, my constituents, our servicemembers, and our country.  Maia served as a mentor for my team, both in my district office and  on Capitol Hill. She led my staff to always put the needs of our  constituents first and work hard to enact real change.  I look forward to seeing the great work that Maia will do as she  takes on new challenges and, no doubt, excels.  Maia, thank you very much for your years of service. You have made a  difference in the lives of many, and I know you will continue to do so  in the years ahead.    "
50,Julia Brownley,2.2297823429107666,D,brownley,brownley," Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  "", H.R. 3798, ', the Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act, my bill  to ensure [[', Page , H4771, ] that women veterans have access to the same contraception coverage as  women currently serving in the military and on the same basis of women  who receive private healthcare.  I thank the chairman for working with me to advance this legislation,  and I am proud that my bill passed the committee with broad bipartisan  support.  As you may know, because of the Affordable Care Act, all women using  civilian health insurance may access basic contraceptive services, like  the pill or an IUD, without a copay.  Last year, the Access to Contraception for Servicemembers and  Dependents Act passed with overwhelming bipartisan support as part of  the annual National Defense Authorization Act to ensure that TRICARE  also provides this basic health benefit to servicemembers and their  dependents. While this was an important step, women veterans currently  do not receive this benefit from the VA.  Clearly, we need to make sure all women who have served our country  receive the same care. My bill will fix this inequity.  The benefits of contraception are widely recognized. Choosing when or  if to have a family is essential to women's health and to their  economic security.  Today, there are 2 million women veterans living in the United  States, and women comprise the fastest growing subpopulation of both  the military and veteran populations. Yet, many of their health needs  go unaddressed in a VA system that has not evolved to equitably serve a  rapidly changing population.  As the chairwoman of the Women's Veterans Task Force and chair of the  House Veterans' Affairs' Subcommittee on Health, members of the task  force and I have worked to identify disparities in healthcare for women  veterans and, where necessary, introduce, advocate for, and pass  legislation that eliminates those gaps.  Mr. Speaker, our veterans have sacrificed so much for us and our  country. It is way past time that we address this inequity and fix this  glaring gap in care of our women veterans. I urge my colleagues to  support our women veterans and vote ``yes'' on "", H.R. 3798, "".  Mr. Speaker, before I conclude, I, too, would just like to publicly  acknowledge my gratitude to Dr. Roe. When the Speaker says the  ``gentleman from Tennessee,'' I believe he truly is a gentleman in the  eyes, I think, of all Members of Congress and, certainly, particularly  mine.  He is a great storyteller that underscores the point that he is  making at all times. There is no question that his leadership and his  advocacy for our veterans, both men and women, are untouchable and  unwavering. I would say how much I have enjoyed working with him on the  Committee of Veterans' Affairs, and I know that he will be missed by  the entire House, but sorely missed within the Committee of Veterans'  Affairs and our daily work there.  I thank him for all that he has done. Whatever his next chapter is in  his life, I hope that he and his new bride enjoy every minute of it.  Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I very, very much appreciate the incredibly kind words.  Some of those stories are probably even true that I tell.  Mr. Speaker, I would take a point of personal privilege before I  close. This will probably be the last time I am down here to speak on  the House floor as the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs before this Congress adjourns in January.  Mr. Speaker, what an honor and privilege it has been. And you cannot  be successful--and I think the chairman will also emphasize this-- without an incredible staff. I have been so blessed with very, very,  very competent people on both sides of the aisle. And it has been fun  working with Ray and the gentleman's staff, and I thank him for that.  They have always been respectful, and I have appreciated that.  Mr. Speaker, you know it is probably time to retire from Congress  when you have delivered one of your staff members, which I have, that  is on our side.  Mr. Speaker, it is not about us. It is about the veterans that we  serve--all of us in this incredible body. How many times in your life  do you get an opportunity to really do good for people?  I will tell you what has influenced me. I grew up in a military town,  Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Clarksville, Tennessee, where the 101st  Airborne is. My scoutmaster, First Sergeant Thomas E. Thayer, was  killed in 1965 in Vietnam. He left four children. I saw what it did to  that family. I have never forgotten that.  After my service was over--I served in Korea in 1973-1974 in the  Second Infantry Division--I came back home, saw what happened to our  Nation's veterans, how they were treated. That has changed.  I am thankful that this country no longer treats the veterans like  they did my Vietnam brothers and sisters who served.  We had the opportunity in this committee, in a bipartisan way, as I  said, to make a difference. In the last Congress, we passed the  Accountability and Whistleblower Protection bill; the Appeals  Modernization that has helped so many people; the Forever GI Bill, and  I used the GI bill when I got out of the military, and it helped me as  a young family, and I know how it transformed this country after World  War II; the MISSION Act, and I could go on and on--the bills we passed  yesterday and the bills we passed today, and we will pass Congresswoman  Brownley's bill in just a moment here.  I got an email last week. We get these all the time. We talked about  the blue water Navy for, I don't know, 10 years, I guess. I get this  email from a widow, who is a veteran, whose husband died in his late  forties with complications of Agent Orange. He served on a service ship  outside Vietnam that offloaded Agent Orange.  Finally, after all these years and the work, Mr. Speaker, we got this  passed in February, I think, of 2019. She got backpay and a stipend for  her and her family for the service that her husband had done. She was a  veteran who had served, too, but not there. I thank the entire body for  doing that because you made a difference in this veteran's life.  Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank the body, the committee, all the people  who have worked, and I certainly want to support Ms. Brownley's bill  and her kind words--I much appreciate that--and I encourage all Members  to vote for this.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
51,Vern Buchanan,0.49950623512268066,R,buchanan,buchanan," Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to  express my strong support the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and  Economic Security (CARES) Act.  The coronavirus is one of the most serious public health threats we  have ever faced, particularly for our seniors and people with  underlying health conditions.  That's why I was pleased to see members of Congress on both sides of  the aisle and the Trump administration work together to craft this $2  trillion emergency relief bill addressing the coronavirus pandemic--the  largest emergency aid bill in history.  This legislation provides much-needed financial assistance for  individuals, families, small and medium-sized businesses, hospitals,  medical facilities and state and local governments. The bill also  includes significant resources for our front-line health care workers  and first responders to ensure they have the vital equipment and  medical supplies they need to protect the American public and  themselves.  Going forward, we need to dramatically ramp-up the supply of test  kits, increase the number of locations where people exhibiting symptoms  can easily get tested, and accelerate the process of getting results  back--hopefully in less than 24 hours.  We also need to accelerate the development of an affordable,  effective vaccine, continue to implement proper quarantine and self- isolation procedures, and ensure the safety of our health workers who  are testing, diagnosing, and treating confirmed cases.  And while I am confident that the legislation before us today is a  significant step in the right direction, there is still much more work  to be done to help my constituents and the American people during this  unprecedented period of health and economic challenges.  With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both side of the  aisle to support this sweeping rescue package and look forward to  President Trump signing it into law.    "
52,Ken Buck,0.15904217958450317,R,buck,buck," Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of amendment No. 58  to the National Defense Authorization Act and to alert America to a  serious national security threat.  The Chinese Communist Party is using TikTok to collect massive  amounts of data from American citizens and our government that could be  used in a cyberattack against our Republic.  We must take action to protect our Nation and stop the Chinese  Communist Party's efforts to undermine our national security. That  starts by passing my commonsense amendment to ban TikTok on all  government-issued technology devices. The clock is ticking.  Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the amendment.    "

54,Larry Bucshon,0.9918940663337708,R,bucshon,bucshon," Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Walden) for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege to call Greg Walden a  colleague and friend. His time as chairman of the House Energy and  Commerce Committee is another chapter of accomplishment and success in  the committee's storied history.  As chairman, Greg approached every issue before the committee with  his eye on achieving results for the American people. That is why we  are here. He strove to reach across the political divide, because he  understood, and still does, our work on behalf of the American people  is far too important to always be derailed by needless partisanship. Of  course, we will have our squabbles back and forth, but at the end of  the day, it is about the American people, and Greg understands that.  From the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act to RAY BAUM'S Act,  as well as too numerous bills signed into law to even list here, Greg's  leadership of the Energy and Commerce Committee produced important  legislation that is, today, making a difference in the lives of the  American people.  Mr. Speaker, I want to personally thank Greg for taking the time to  bring me in and ask for my professional medical diagnosis of many major  healthcare-related issues or other pieces of legislation before the  committee.  I know at times we doctors can tell you things you don't want to  hear--and quit laughing--but Greg always listened intently and worked  with me to help find a cure, so to speak, or a remedy, and for that, I  will always be appreciative.  Greg, your wisdom, charisma, and unflappable leadership will be  greatly missed in the 117th Congress.  I wish you and Mylene the best as you both begin this new chapter of  your lives, and I look forward to continuing to call you friend.  {time} 1330    "
55,Ted Budd,0.5275022983551025,R,budd,budd," Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the frustrated and,  frankly, exhausted small business job-creators in my district and  across the Nation who are struggling to survive while the Speaker  continues to play politics with people's livelihoods.  While many States and localities begin to make the same mistake of  instituting massive shutdowns, small businesses have been left high and  dry. [["", Page , H6916, ]  Imagine pouring everything you have emotionally and financially into  an idea; then you watch it grow and thrive, but, through no fault of  your own, it gets ruined because your local government shuts you down  and the Federal Government refuses to help.  The Speaker can solve this problem today by allowing a vote to  unleash over $130 billion in already-appropriated leftover PPP funding.  In addition, the House should immediately consider the Small Business  Expense Protection Act, which was introduced by my friend and fellow  North Carolinian, George Holding. That bill would clarify the confusion  at the IRS and make sure that recipients can deduct PPP-financed  expenses on their taxes.  Mr. Speaker, for the sake of our Nation's job creators and for the  sake of our workers, it is time that we act to support our fellow  citizens as we enter the final stages of our battle against this virus.    "
56,Tim Burchett,0.44988739490509033,R,burchett,burchett," Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, the American entrepreneurial spirit is the  bedrock of our Nation's economy, creating good-paying jobs, solving  everyday problems, and providing the goods and services we rely on. I  rise today to celebrate the A.G. Heins Company, which rode the  entrepreneurial spirit from humble beginnings to 100 years of success  in our community.  Currently in its fourth generation of family ownership, the A.G.  Heins Company has long provided building materials to the east  Tennessee region. The company provides necessary resources to complete  projects of all sizes, from individual household repairs, to  construction at the University of Tennessee.  Staying in business for 100 years is no easy accomplishment, and the  A.G. Heins Company persevered through many challenging economic times,  such as the Great Depression and the Second World War. The company's  history is a reminder that small businesses can grow and innovate even  in the face of adversity, Mr. Speaker.  I extend my congratulations to the Heins family as they celebrate  their 100th year in business this month, and I wish them many more  years of success.    "
57,Michael Burgess,1.0068398714065552,R,burgess,burgess," Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, hearing some of the earlier discussion,  just for a data point, this is December 21, the longest night of the  year, as they say.  On August 21, the former Vice President, in accepting the Democratic  Party nomination for President, in his acceptance speech, said: Look,  let's be clear. No miracle is coming.  Well, here we are, 4 months later, with not one but two vaccines,  each in excess of 90 percent effective; absolutely phenomenal.  As another data point, in August 2014, the Ebola crisis was raging in  Western Africa. A vaccine was out of phase 1 trials. It took 5\\1/2\\  years to deliver that vaccine. This one was delivered in 10 months. It  is absolutely incredible.  Look, in the bill before us today, there are some high points, and  there are some low points. A couple of things I do want to point out.  The Independence at Home Act that I introduced with Congresswoman  Dingell several years ago was continued and expanded.  One of the biggest deals for me is coverage for immunosuppressive  drugs after a renal transplant. I have been working on this for 10  years. Now, we have provided additional protection for people who are  recipients of renal transplants so that they can continue to get their  immunosuppressive drugs.  Some flexibility has been provided in the bill to allow for value- based care. The alternative payment model threshold is frozen for 2  years. That is important.  Project ECHO, which allows for primary care doctors in remote areas  to be able to consult with specialists, has been continued. That is a  big deal.  The out-of-network billing has been tough, and it has been tough in a  year that has been tough on our Nation's frontline healthcare  personnel. The out-of-network billing language has improved  dramatically over the last 18 months. I cannot say that it is perfect,  but some of the more recent improvements, such as the prevention of  putting payment data from public payers in the independent dispute  resolution process, are pretty big wins for our physicians.  I will also add that it is an unusual time that they should have to  be facing additional cuts when our doctors have been on the front lines  of providing care for America's patients during this pandemic. Faced  with out-of-network payment reductions from the insurance companies and  with reductions through the evaluation and management codes, the E and  M codes, it is a funny way to go about rewarding those that we would  refer to as our Nation's heroes.  Still, Mr. Speaker, the American people do need the relief that is  provided in this coronavirus package.    "
58,Cheri Bustos,0.9142681956291199,D,bustos,bustos," Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of Daniel  Miller, the eldest of six children, from Galesburg, Illinois.  A member of the varsity football team, his principal described him as  ``always smiling'' and ``caring about everyone.''  In 2004, he joined the Air Force and continued to lead as a senior  airman. With great courage, he defused explosive devices and worked  with chemical and biological weapons.  On January 7, 2007, Senior Airman Miller, Senior Airman Elizabeth A.  Loncki, and Technical Sergeant Timothy R. Weiner all made the ultimate  sacrifice, attempting to defuse a car bomb in Iraq.  Our Nation will never be able to repay them, but it is our duty to  remember their service. It is my honor today to commemorate the service  of Senior Airman Miller with the dedication of the U.S. Post Office on  East Main Street in Galesburg, Illinois, as the Senior Airman Daniel  Miller Post Office Building.    "
59,G.K. Butterfield,0.9802416563034058,D,butterfield,butterfield," Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I thank all the speakers this evening.  I understand the time has been precious, and I thank all of them for  their patience and willingness to participate.  The 13th Amendment reads as follows: ``Neither slavery nor  involuntary servitude . . . shall exist within the United States, or  any place subject to their jurisdiction.''  This amendment was added to the United States Constitution by an act  of Congress on January 31, 1865, ratified by the requisite number of  States on December 6, 1865, 155 years ago.    "
60,Bradley Byrne,0.27331817150115967,R,byrne,byrne," Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. My  grandparents were from Indiana, and the gentlewoman from Indiana  represents her State well, and I have appreciated our relationship.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give my farewell speech to this House,  and I am going to surprise some people by saying that I rise today with  hope and optimism. I know that is unusual because there are people on  both sides of the House that want to say this country is in a bad place  and heading in the wrong direction.  I believe that view ignores two very important things. One is our  history, and the other is what I hear the people of America telling us.  Several years ago, a number of us from the Senate and the House, both  parties, had the privilege of spending an evening at the Library of  Congress with the noted American history writer David McCullough. At  the end of the evening, the moderator turned to him and said: What  parting words do you have for these Members of Congress?  And he said: I think if the people of America knew their history  better, they would be more hopeful, they would be more optimistic.  I have been listening to the people of my district for the last 7  years. When I was listening to them, I had no preconceived notions  about what they thought, and, buddy, they told me. And the American  people, through elections, have told us, too. And the great thing about  our elections is there are no filters.  If you go back and look at the history of this country, you will see  some notable things. One is that this country was founded by people who  believed in principles, in morals, and values that defined who we are.  They took a tremendous risk in fighting the most powerful military  nation in the world, Great Britain, and they did it after declaring  something very important, not just that they were declaring  independence, but the reasons for why they were doing it.  That Congress was the Second Continental Congress. The First  Continental Congress, which met in 1774, is the forerunner to this  House, a group of people elected to represent the people of this  country. It is a notion as old as the creation of Parliament and the  House of Commons of England, something that was their heritage.  Now, they took a great risk because they felt they faced a great  risk. They had been told when those colonies were founded that they  would have the same rights as all English people, and they found after  the French and Indian war that that wasn't true, that those rights were  going to be taken from them, and they were willing to fight for those  rights.  Now, Mr. Speaker, let me say this very clearly. They didn't come into  this with clean hands. When the Europeans came to this continent, this  was not a new world. This was an old world. There was a civilization  already here that had been here for thousands of years. And between our  germs, which they had no defense against, and other things worse than  that, we essentially took this land from them.  In 1619, European slave traders brought the first slave to this  country. So when they went into that fight with the British, they  didn't have clean hands. But societies are complex things, and because  they didn't have clean hands didn't mean they didn't have clean hearts.  And they did.  They waged an incredible war for 5 years against this great military  power and won. And they won because of what they stood on. Go back and  look at the Declaration of Independence. One sentence in there really  says it all: ``We hold these truths. . . . `'  Truths, absolutes, not something you get to change your mind about.  ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created  equal. . . . `'  Yes, I know they used the word ``men,'' but the principle of equality  was in there. It was in what they were standing on. And they said we  were created equal, which means we had a Creator. And they go on in the  very next phrase and they say: ``We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their  Creator. . . . `'  They were gifted. Endowed means gifted. They were gifted by their  Creator, by God himself with certain unalienable rights, rights that  can't be taken away from them. And that [["", Page , H7032, ] among these rights are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And  that governments are instituted among men to secure those very  liberties, `` . . . deriving their just powers from the consent of the  governed.''  We need to reread that sentence over and over again. Government  doesn't exist for the politicians. Government exists to secure rights,  and the power we have is the power the people give us.  Now, I know very well that we had to follow up that desperate war and  that declaration by creating a Constitution, the Constitution we are  under today. Sadly, it is a Constitution I fear too many people,  including too many people in power, don't know much about. Because the  purpose of the Constitution was not only to create a government that  had enough power to do what needed to be done for the things that are  listed in the preamble of the Constitution, it also put limits on that  government. And some of us act as if there are no limits on this  government.  And our Founders knew because they had to fight against a tyrannical  central government that there needed to be limits on government. Those  same English rights that they had inherited had been secured because  people, for hundreds of years, had to fight back against British kings  that wanted to take power and use it against the people.  {time} 2015  People lost their lives. There was great suffering, as there was in  our Revolution, because tyrannical central governments don't give their  power back easily, they don't give them back without a fight. That  fight continued in the Constitution.  The Bill of Rights, which was adopted by this House in the very first  Congress under the leadership of James Madison, as he said in his  speech to the House when he introduced the Bill of Rights, he said,  this is all about making sure that we take away from this powerful  government we have created any notion that they can trample on certain  specific rights, and they laid them out. And in a couple years, all the  States necessary ratified those amendments, and they are part of the  fundamental law of this country, although sometimes we act like they  are not.  I have listened, by the way, to some of the debates about what rights  we have under the Free Exercise Clause. The Free Exercise Clause is in  the First Amendment to the Constitution, and it says, Congress can't  make any law that establishes a religion or infringes upon the free  exercise of that religion; exercise, action. We have a right to freely  exercise our religion, and we need to remember that fundamental right  along with the others.  Now, that was our founding: the Declaration of Independence, the War  for Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights. That was our  founding, not 1619. And we need to remember the principles of our  founding, because they are central to who we are as people.  Now, over the course of the 19th century, we were invaded by Great  Britain, the Capitol Building here was burned, the White House was  burned. We could have given up, but we didn't, because that is not who  we are.  We not only survived, we fought on and built this great country so  that by 1860, we not only bordered on the Atlantic Ocean, we bordered  on the Pacific Ocean and we bordered on the Rio Grande. We grew by  leaps and bounds.  Then in 1861, we entered another tragedy, because the people that put  that Constitution together failed in at least one critical regard: they  failed to address the issue of slavery, and we fought a terrible Civil  War that cost the lives of 600,000 Americans to solve a problem that  should have been solved in 1787.  Despite that war, we came back, we ended slavery, we adopted the  Fourteenth Amendment and the Fifteenth Amendment, and we grew as a  Nation throughout the rest of the 19th century.  Finally, in the early 20th century, we did the right thing and gave  women the right to vote. Neither of my grandmothers, as young adult  women with families, could vote. It is amazing that that was true just  that long ago, but it was. But we corrected it, as we always do.  In World War II, this country fought an incredibly difficult world  war on three different continents and beat the most powerful nations in  the world, and at the end of that war, stood as the only real power  left on the Earth.  And we had a choice. We could have walked away, come right back to  our shores and said, we are going back to being the insular country we  have been. We could have also said, we have got more power than  everybody else; we are going to use it against everybody else to make  ourselves wealthy.  We did neither.  We stood up and led the world, and created a rules-based order that  has benefited people all over the world, that has lifted billions of  people out of poverty, that has increased the lifespan of billions of  people, that spread democracy and freedom around the globe, because  that is who we are.  While we were doing that, we were also facing our problems here at  home. Yes, we have problems here at home. We didn't finish the work of  the Civil War. We had to go through a difficult civil rights movement,  and in this House, we adopted the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and in this  House, we adopted the 1965 Voting Rights Act. We did that.  We provided things for the education of the children of this country  they didn't have. We provided things for healthcare in this country  that people didn't have. We provided for clean air and clean water.  We addressed our own problems while we were leading the world,  because that is who we are. We do those things.  Now, I understand that there are people that want to give us a  different version of that history. They want to tell us that we are all  evil from birth, that somehow this country is inherently evil.  That just doesn't square with historic facts.  They want to rewrite history.  The first thing any authoritarian government does is rewrite history  or attempt to do it. The authoritarian wannabes in this country are  trying to rewrite our history, and they want to do that to pursue a  radical agenda that doesn't match up with what the American people  want.  They try to call themselves Progressives. That is not progressive.  Wanting a powerful central government is regressive. That is regressing  back to what we rebelled against in 1776.  They are not progressive. They are Socialists. They are at least  honest in saying that. But they are not progressive. It is regressive.  Let me tell you what I hear the American people say in my district  and around this country. They are saying this: We Americans aren't  evil. We are and have been a force for good here and around the world.  We aren't Socialists. We don't want a powerful, overreaching central  government.  We don't want Medicare for all, where the government makes decisions  for us and our doctors, and rations when and how we get our healthcare.  We believe our healthcare system is the best in the world, and we want  to keep it that way, but we also want to assure that everyone in this  country has real access to it.  We don't want a Green New Deal, which jacks up our utility bills,  saps our economic competitiveness, and destroys jobs.  We don't want to defund the police. In fact, we think spending on  public safety is a good thing. We value our law enforcement officers  and we grieve when one is killed, as dozens are every year.  We want our government to defend our shores and interests and protect  us here at home. We rely upon the men and women wearing our uniform to  do that, and we want our government to take care of them.  I have gotten the chance to travel all over the world to see our men  and women in uniform, many of them in harm's way, and I am so proud of  them. And like most Americans, I want to make sure we are doing the  right thing by them.  We want to make sure that there is opportunity in this country for  everyone. Everyone. Don't leave anybody out. We want everybody to be  able to take advantage of all that this Nation has to offer. And to  achieve that goal, we need quality education for everybody in this  country, and not just for the privileged.  It shouldn't be the case that you get one caliber of education  because of [["", Page , H7033, ] where you live, one type of education, one quality of education, and a  worse one if you live in some other place. We should give everybody the  freedom to have quality education so that they can take advantage of  those opportunities.  We want justice for everyone. Everyone. Because injustice to anyone  is injustice to us all.  We want our air and water to be clean.  We want to continue to be the economic leader of the world.  Let me stop and say a word about China.  The greatest external threat to this country is China; not the  Chinese people, but the Communist Party that runs China. They seek to  become the only power in the world; not a power, the only power. And  they will do anything--anything. They will stop at nothing to get it.  It is past time for us to wake up and understand the threat that they  are, not just to us, but to the entire world and that rules-based order  we created after World War II.  And, Mr. Speaker, we the American people are tired of being divided,  divided by our region. Since when is it okay for the coasts to look  down on the other parts of the country?  We don't want to be divided by race. People aren't defined by the  color of their skin, they are not defined by their ethnicity, they are  not defined by their national origin. That is anti-American to think  that way. We should come together over that.  We don't want to be divided by our gender.  We don't want to be divided by religion. Whether you have got a  religion or not, we don't want to be divided by it.  We don't want to be divided by generation, the young versus the old.  It has always been that the old handed something valuable to the next  generation. That is what we should be about.  That division in our country is the greatest internal threat we have  got. And I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, it is the greatest threat of  all, because there is nothing that this great Nation can't accomplish  when we are united, when we are e pluribus unum, out of many, one.  That is who America is, that is who the American people want us to  be, and that is the great challenge before this House.  I have had a great experience here in Congress. I have met some  wonderful people. I have had the privilege of serving on the House  Armed Services Committee, the Education and Labor Committee, and the  Rules Committee. I have seen a lot of important things be done here and  be done right.  The best legislation passed in this House is bipartisan legislation.  The worst legislation is almost always partisan legislation. Usually it  doesn't make it across the finish line, by the way.  Our ability to work together should be what we should all be striving  for in this House, and I hope the House to follow will do that.  Mr. Speaker, before I take my leave, I want to say a few things.  I want to thank the many Members of this House who have befriended me  and helped me on both sides of the aisle. I particularly want to thank  my fellow colleagues in the Alabama delegation. They have been a great  family to be a part of.  I want to thank the staff. The staff of this House is amazing, so  very helpful, so very competent, and we just couldn't get our jobs down  without you.  I want to thank the good people of southwest Alabama. They gave me  the great privilege of being here to represent them as their only  representative. What an honor that has been. I hope and pray that I  have fulfilled the trust that they put in me, because they are my  bosses.  I want to thank my many supporters who time and time again helped me,  and sometimes it wasn't so easy to do what they had to do.  I want to thank my office staff here in Washington and the district.  They made me look good every day, and I could not have done what I have  done without them. So to all of my staff, present and former, thank you  for what you have done for me.  And I want to thank my long-suffering family. You know, they have  loved me and they supported me, even when I wasn't so lovable and even  when it wasn't so easy to support me. I could not have done it without  them.  So to my son Patrick, his wife, Carolyn, my grandchildren MacGuire  and Ann Roberts; my daughter Kathleen and her husband, Steve, and son,  Cooper; my daughter Laura, her husband, Lieutenant Commander Stephen  Prugh, now presently at the Pentagon; my son Colin; and most of all, I  want to thank my wife, Rebecca.  You know, these are hard positions and it is really hard to be the  spouse of somebody in these positions, and Rebecca has done a  tremendous job in supporting me in every way you could ask. She is  truly the love of my life for 40 years now, and I want to thank her for  all that she has done for me in all those 40 years, but particularly  these last 7 years.  And now, Mr. Speaker, I say farewell to this House. God bless you  all, and God bless the United States of America.    "
61,Ken Calvert,0.2932676076889038,R,calvert,calvert," Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation.  First, I want to thank Chairwoman Lowey for her hard work and her  dedication to this institution, and I wish her well in her retirement.  And I certainly want to thank our ranking member for her hard work  and all the things that went into getting this bill together. I know it  is difficult. We certainly appreciate it.  And, finally, Chairman Pete Visclosky, not only my chairman, but my  close friend, who has worked hard on this bill, and he has done a  wonderful job over the years and is certainly a patriot who deserves  the credit in putting this Defense bill together.  The Constitution grants Congress the explicit and sacred  responsibility to provide for our Nation's defense. This bill before us  today does just that. It provides funding for many key programs  consistent with the National Defense Strategy and its focus on great  power competition with China and Russia.  The bill prioritizes and funds programs essential to our continued  military dominance. It provides our combatant commanders with the  resources and equipment they need to carry out their missions around  the world.  We continue key investments in fifth-generation combat aircraft,  ships, [["", Page , H7304, ] and two Virginia-class submarines, while also continuing to invest in  the essential research and development of new technologies essential to  maintaining U.S. military superiority.  We continue to prioritize the health and welfare of our men and women  in uniform. The funding in this bill reflects the longstanding concerns  that so many of our Members have had with Defense health programs,  sexual assault prevention, suicide prevention, and the long-awaited  electronic health record, which we need to get fixed.  We must get this bill signed into law as soon as possible. According  to the DOD comptroller, a continuing resolution wastes $1.7 billion per  month and stops many of the modernization priorities that are the  cornerstone of maintaining our military's superiority over near-peer  threats such as China and Russia.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we were able to overcome politically  charged issues to negotiate this final passage. I urge all the Members  to vote for it.    "
62,Salud Carbajal,0.8887825608253479,D,carbajal,carbajal," Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, more than 245,000 Americans have already  died due to COVID-19. Cases are surging to unprecedented levels.  Millions are facing poverty, food insecurity, and eviction. Low-income,  homeless, and minority communities have been hit especially hard and  disproportionately.  With the winter and holidays upon us, this wave threatens the health  and economic well-being of our entire country. I am proud that we have  already enacted four bipartisan economic relief packages that delivered  targeted assistance to those impacted by this pandemic. We need to do  it again. We must act now during this Congress.  Another relief package should include a robust national strategy for  testing, tracing, and vaccination. Businesses, local governments,  workers, and families need help to make ends meet. We must come  together to deliver and help America with the urgent needs that it has  and get this virus under control.    "
63,Tony Cardenas,1.3369059562683105,D,cardenas,cardenas," Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the Appropriations  Committee and the subcommittee chairs for including two amendments that  I submitted to "", H.R. 7617, ', division [[', Page , H4134, ] B and division F, in the en bloc being considered today.  For years, we have been funding a juvenile justice system that is  robbing children of their futures and wasting taxpayer dollars. Today,  experts, academics, advocates, and police departments agree we must  change that for the better.  I am proud to have introduced two amendments to ', H.R. 7617, ', division  B, that will increase funding for programs that focus on girls in the  juvenile justice system and invest in collaborative mental health and  antirecidivism initiatives.  I have also cosponsored an amendment led by my colleague, Congressman  Rush, that will increase funding for community-based violence  prevention initiatives and also introduced an amendment to ', H.R. 7617, "",  division F, that will increase funds for the National Child Traumatic  Stress Initiative. This investment will help increase evidence-based  support for youth with mental health needs that have been exacerbated  by this pandemic.  I ask for my colleagues to support this bill and my amendments that  are offered today. We need to have a better system for our children.    "
64,Andre Carson,0.1591608226299286,D,carson,carson," Ms. CARSON. In 2014, were there concerns in Washington,   here in Washington, and European capitals that Russia might   not stop in Ukraine?    "
65,Andre Carson,0.1591608226299286,D,carson,carson, Mr. CARSON. And which country stands to benefit the most--  would stand to benefit the most from such a withdrawal?    
66,Andre Carson,0.1591608226299286,D,carson,carson," Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Tri-Caucus' Special Order to highlight the disproportionate impact of  COVID-19 on communities of color. Our nation is currently overwhelmed  by unprecedented numbers of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and  deaths. After more than eight months of suffering, the COVID-19  pandemic continues to ravage our communities, creating incalculable  pain, massive economic disruption, and immense strain on our public  health system. As of this moment, more than 246,000 Americans have lost  their lives from this deadly disease. More than eleven million have  been infected, and nearly 70,000 are currently hospitalized with severe  cases of COVID-19. While all Americans are suffering from this  pandemic, communities of color are experiencing acute and  disproportionate pain.  From the beginning of this pandemic, it was clear that the phrase  ``when white America catches a cold, Black America gets pneumonia''  would be particularly true with COVID-19's devastating consequences. In  fact, the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately harms Black and Brown  communities with dramatically unequal infection rates,  hospitalizations, and deaths. Specifically, Black people are three  times more likely to become infected with COVID-19 than whites.  Moreover, Black people die from COVID-19 at around twice the rate of  white people. These aren't just statistics. They represent our friends,  neighbors, and loved ones. They are people like my cousin who died from  COVID-19 earlier this year, and so many others who are no longer with  us.  Like past disease outbreaks and natural disasters, the COVID-19  pandemic lays bare the consequences of systemic injustices suffered by  communities of color. Institutional racism, compounded by environmental  and economic injustices, have resulted in severe health disparities for  communities of color which make the COVID-19 pandemic so uniquely  devastating. Despite the disproportionate harm the COVID-19 pandemic  has caused among communities of color, many states still do not provide  transparency regarding racial and ethnic demographic data for COVID-19  cases and deaths. For example, in my state of Indiana, the State only  provides an aggregate breakdown of the racial and ethnic demographics  for cases and deaths during the entire pandemic. This results in a  profoundly incomplete picture of the disproportionate sickness, death,  fear and tragedy this virus is inflicting on communities of color.  As Congress considers much-needed, additional measures to combat  COVID-19 and provide relief for businesses, hospitals and workers, one  thing is clear: Communities of color must receive substantial relief  and support that matches the devastation they've suffered from this  pandemic. In addition, states and public health departments must  provide updated and daily demographic information, including a racial  and ethnic breakdown, for the daily numbers of COVID-19 cases and  deaths. This data transparency is essential to fully understand how the  pandemic is affecting different communities and how we can best  respond. With this data, we can better target our COVID-19 relief funds  and support to ensure that communities of color get all the help we  need to weather the storm of this pandemic and combat the underlying  inequities in our health care system that this pandemic has  exacerbated.  I am committed to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to act now and to act boldly to implement a national plan that will  save lives from this terrible disease.    "

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about division D of "", H.R. 7608, "", the  Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill for  fiscal year 2021.  Throughout my time in Congress, I have focused on three things:  soldiers, their families, and veterans. It is an honor to serve as the  ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee that has their  interests in the forefront of our minds.  Overall, I strongly support the funding provided for military  construction projects. I am pleased the bill includes funding for the  services' unfunded priorities: privatized military housing, resilient  and energy-efficient installations, and cleanup of contaminated sites.  On a bipartisan basis, the bill increases funding for women veterans,  mental health and homeless programs, and supports construction of new  VA facilities.  Veterans have earned special attention for their service and  sacrifice. In many ways, this bill helps to fulfill our promises to  them.  However, unfortunately and regretfully, I must express my opposition  to "", H.R. 7608, "". Less than a year ago, we agreed to the 2019 Bipartisan  Budget Act. I believe it is irresponsible to designate some funding as  emergency just to avoid the caps set by that act. This is especially  true since we all acknowledged the growing costs of veterans'  healthcare programs when we agreed to the budget deal.  I recognize the budget realities we face, but we should not unravel  that agreement through this year's appropriations process. I am also  concerned that this bill includes provisions that limit the President's  ability to address the national emergency on our southern border.  Regardless of one's position, the fact remains that cartels and  criminal gangs take advantage of our political disagreements and  continue to flood our Nation with dangerous and illegal drugs and  exploit and traffic men, women, and children seeking a better life.  This is unacceptable.  While I oppose the final passage of the bill, I believe that the  committee can continue to work together to fund programs important to  soldiers, their families, and veterans in a responsible manner.  In closing, I would like to thank my subcommittee chairwoman, Ms.  Wasserman Schultz, for her dedication to our subcommittee and its  responsibilities. Also, I want to thank Chairwoman Lowey for her  service and leadership in this Congress, and I want to thank Ranking  Member Granger for her support and commitment to enacting responsible  spending bills.

I know there are those of us in this Chamber for whom the spending of  one Federal dollar is a physically painful event, but now is not the  time to be deficit hawks. Now is the time for us to come together.  The United States of America is more than the sum of its parts. In  times of great danger to our Nation, we come together, and the Federal  Government leads the way. We did it when we defeated fascism in Europe  and Asia. We did it when we rebuilt Europe and Asia to become great  allies and peaceful and productive partners.  We can do it again. We have a terrible enemy right now in the COVID  virus. It is wrecking our economy, and it is killing our people. We  have lost more than 300,000 people, more than our combat losses in  World War II.  Let's work together for robust COVID relief for our economy. Let's  get it done, Mr. Speaker.    "
72,Ed Case,0.6298374533653259,D,case,case," Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of ', H.R. 6585, ' with deep  reservations.  I support the substance of the measure as addressing key concerns for  American Indians and Alaska Natives. My grave concern is with the  inexplicable omission of Native Hawaiians as indistinguishably  indigenous peoples of this country to be treated and included the same.  I spelled out my concerns at length in a submission to the record of  my Committee on Natural Resources on this measure and I include in the  Record my statement:  U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources:  July 29, 2020 Full Committee Markup on ', H.R. 6535, ':  Additional Remarks for the Record:  U.S. Congressman Ed Case:  Chairman Grijalva, Ranking Member Bishop and fellow   Committee members, I respectfully submit these additional   remarks for the record on ', H.R. 6535, "", introduced by my friend   and colleague on the Committee, Mr. Gallego, also Chair of   the Committee's Subcommittee on Indigenous Peoples of the   United States on which I am also honored to serve.  "", H.R. 6535, "", considered and unanimously reported by this   Committee on July 29, 2020, would extend federal tort claims   coverage for certain personal injury claims to urban Indian   organizations by deeming them part of the Public Health   Service, similar to current coverage provided to Indian   tribes, tribal organizations, Indian contractors and   employees. I fully endorse this measure and was pleased to be   able to support it in both Subcommittee and full Committee.  However, I must register my deep concern that Native   Hawaiian Health Care Systems (NHHCS) have not also been   extended the same coverage in this measure or otherwise.   Although there are legitimate procedural and related non-  substantive reasons for not including them in this specific   vehicle, I wish to affirm for the record that this is clearly   unfinished business that should and must be remedied by this   Committee and Congress at the earliest opportunity.  The current federal tort claims coverage extends to many   health care providers serving American Indian and Alaska   Native individuals in the Indian Health Service (IHS) and   tribal facilities as part of the undertakings and obligations   of our country to our indigenous peoples. Whole segments of   our indigenous populations depend on these providers for   their health needs, in particular primary and preventive   care. The practical effect of covering these critical   organizations under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) is to   simplify the processing and resolution of medical malpractice   and other personal injury claims against the organization,   which expedites settlement of legitimate claims and decreases   administrative and related expense burdens, thus enabling   providers to deliver more extensive and better service to   their communities.  FTCA coverage has extended for decades to the IHS and   tribal organizations including indigenous-focused federally   qualified health centers (to include Native Hawaiian   Community Health Centers (NHCHC).) However, for reasons that   reflect simple omission rather than any other explanation,   urban Indian organizations and NHHCS, first established under   the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act of 1988, are   not currently covered under the FTCA. This bill would correct   that as to urban Indian organizations but not NHHCS.  There is no policy or functional differentiation among   urban Indian organizations, NHHCS, tribal organizations and   NHCHC in FTCA coverage, nor between NHHCS and urban Indian   organizations. Both urban Indian organizations and NHHCS are   devoted to the same needs for the same reasons as the others.   In fact, in Hawai'i, where we have the largest population of   Native Hawaiians of any state but relatively few Native   Americans and Alaska Natives, our NHHCS actually contract   with the IHS to provide our own and visiting Native Americans   and Alaska Natives with reduced cost health care and payer of   last resort services (and at actual costs that far exceed the   contracted amounts).  Moreover, in the public health context, there is every   reason for Native Hawaiians to seek the same benefits as   afforded to other indigenous organizations under FTCA   coverage. Even aside from COVID-19, Native Hawaiians suffer   from the shortest life expectancy of the major ethnic groups   in Hawai'i due to underlying medical conditions such as   diabetes, coronary heart disease and asthma. With higher   unemployment rates, Native Hawaiians are in particular need   of the culturally relevant, lower cost health care options   offered by Native Hawaiian-focused organizations like NHHCS.   All this has been worsened by COVID-19, which has inflicted   some of the highest infection and mortality rates on Native   Hawaiian/Pacific Islander communities nationwide. The   extension of FTCA to NHHCC is just one of many initiatives   that can make a real difference in ensuring NHHCS can   continue to serve their own populations in these times of   great challenge and need.  During my Subcommittee on the Indigenous Peoples of the   United States' July 19, 2020 hearing on "", H.R. 6535, "", I asked   IHS Director RADM Michael D. Weahkee whether there was any   policy reason to differentiate between NHHCS, urban Indian   organizations and other tribal health care providers in FTCA   coverage. Director Weahkee responded: ``In one of my roles as   Indian Health Service Director, I serve as the Vice Chair of   the Interdepartmental Council on Native American Affairs at   the Department of Health and Human Services, and that   responsibility extends not only to our American Indian and   Alaska Native populations, but also to our Native Hawaiian   and Pacific Islanders, and so in that chair I would see the   same advantage toward Native Hawaiian programs as I discussed   here today for our American Indian urban Indian   organizations.'' Further, the Congressional Budget Office   previously reviewed similar legislation, the Native Hawaiian   Health Care Improvement Reauthorization Act of 2003, and   determined there was no appreciable cost to the federal   government.  Aside from these bill specifics, I ask this Committee to   understand and appreciate my Native Hawaiian community's goal   of extending FTCA coverage to NHHCS, and its great concern at   being excluded from "", H.R. 6535, "", as not just a policy   inconsistency but in a much broader context. To repeat,   Native Hawaiians are the indigenous peoples of our country to   the same degree and extent as other indigenous peoples. As   such, the United States has undertaken a similar special   trust responsibility to Native Hawaiians dating back to   Hawaii's entry into the United States as a territory in 1900,   and continuing through the seminal century-old Hawaiian Homes   Commission Act of 1920 and some 150-plus more Native Hawaiian   federal statutes and equally if not more numerous specific   regulations, administrative actions and other initiative   since including the Native Hawaiian Education Act and Native   Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act. This is not a new or   questionable relationship in any way and has the same long   and often difficult history as other indigenous peoples.  Notwithstanding, Native Hawaiians have faced decades of   being overlooked, ignored and excluded in our federal   initiatives to fulfill our country's trust responsibilities   to our indigenous peoples. It has proven too easy to ask   Native Hawaiians to just wait while we take care of another   indigenous concern first, while too often the wait has not   materialized into any later action. So please understand that   when Native Hawaiians express great concern over exclusion   from a seemingly straightforward bill like "", H.R. 6535, "", their   skepticism, apprehension and distrust has deep roots that   transcend this specific bill.  Chair, Ranking Member and Committee colleagues, I   personally appreciate your consideration of my additional   remarks on behalf of our country's vital Native Hawaiian   community, and hope that I have provided you with some   broader appreciation of why we believe that inclusion of   NHHCS in FTCA coverage as is provided for virtually all other   indigenous health care organizations is so important. I look   forward to working with your and our like-minded colleagues   to achieve such inclusion in other appropriate vehicles.  Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much).  I fully expect that further measures I am asked to support   of benefit to American Indians and Alaska Natives will   include Native Hawaiians.  Thank you.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

73,Sean Casten,0.8515360951423645,D,casten,casten," Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Madam Speaker, imagine that you are a banker  reviewing a corporate loan application. Over the last decade,  competition has eroded this company's market share. They slashed prices  in response; they burned through their cash. 250 similar companies have  gone bankrupt since 2014.  Would you make that loan?  This is today's U.S. fossil fuel industry. Since 2010, coal demand is  down 45 percent. Natural gas prices are down 40 percent. Oil prices are  down 45 percent. Shale producers have chewed through $342 billion of  free cash flow. Exxon just wrote off $20 billion in value. Wells Fargo  booked $121 million in sector losses.  And yet, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has recently  proposed a rule to mandate that banks provide ``fair access to  capital'' to this sector. They would force you to use your balance  sheet to take on excessive risk without commensurate return. They would  reduce our financial stability and raise our energy costs.  I look forward to a full-throated and bipartisan condemnation of the  OCC's attempt to use, dare I say, socialist tools to prop up an  industry that is unable to succeed in the rough-and-tumble world of  free-market capitalism.

75,Kathy Castor,1.031051754951477,D,castor,castor," Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Pallone for  yielding me the time.  We are in the grips of a climate crisis, a climate emergency, and  time is running out. Time is running out to avoid the worst  consequences of a heating planet. Time is running out to avoid the  escalating costs that are weighing down families and businesses across  America.  So this Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act is an important step.  It brings us a little bit closer to the major ambitious steps that we  must take towards a 100 percent clean energy economy.  Here are a few things that are important about this package. It  follows the science. The scientists and experts tell us that we truly  are running out of time to reduce carbon emissions and greenhouse  gases. We must do it as soon as possible, but no later than 2050. That  means we have to get going right away.  This package also puts money back in the pockets of consumers and  businesses and it will create thousands of jobs. These are the jobs  that the younger generation are hungry for, in manufacturing and  science, and building resilience among communities all across this  country.  This bill also empowers environmental justice communities to address  pollution and to protect their health. Very importantly, on a  bipartisan basis, bicameral basis, we have to address  hydrofluorocarbons. A hydrofluorocarbon is a very damaging greenhouse  gas, much more damaging than carbon dioxide.  We have an opportunity in this Congress to address those  hydrofluorocarbons and bring them under control. If we don't do this  now, it is going to be much more difficult to do it in the future.  So I thank Chairman Pallone, Chairwoman Johnson, and I thank my  colleagues for doing what they can.  Next up are the ambitious policies to truly solve the climate crisis.    "

I would like to thank the ranking member, Mr. McCaul, for his work on  this important issue. This is a strong bill that I am pleased to  support, and I urge my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, to do the  same.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, "", H.R. 5664, ', as amended.  The question was taken.

77,Joaquin Castro,1.187753438949585,D,castro,castro," Mr. CASTRO. Mr. Speaker, this month, the American people were  unwillingly taken to the brink of war at the reckless direction of this  administration. As a coequal branch of government, we must ensure that  no President can take any military action without coming to Congress  first.  Repealing the 2002 AUMF and passing the No War Against Iran Act will  prevent any future escalation or military action without the full  consideration and consent of this body. At the same time, they preserve  the military's ability to take actions in self-defense to protect our  forces.  The American people are tired of unnecessary wars that leave our  country less safe. It is our responsibility as elected Representatives  to prevent our Nation from entering an unnecessary war with Iran. These  measures are critical in that respect.  We cannot allow recklessness to lead us into a protracted conflict  that is not in our interests and will lead to suffering.    "
78,Steve Chabot,1.8913886547088623,R,chabot,chabot," Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for  his leadership on this issue and so many other issues over the years.  Madam Speaker, for months now, our Nation's entrepreneurs and small  business owners have been pleading for additional help from Congress. I  have been hearing this from small businesses back in my district in the  greater Cincinnati area. I know that my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle have been hearing the same thing from their constituents.  While I am relieved that Congress is finally acting on those cries  for help, I am dismayed that it has taken this long. I introduced a  bill back in September, 3 months ago, that could have been brought to  the floor and helped those small businesses that so desperately needed  that help back then.  That bill included many of the same provisions that we are voting on  today. Instead, this House, under Democratic control, considered bills  about marijuana and online conspiracy theories, for example. It is an  embarrassment that it has taken this long because every moment of delay  put more small businesses at risk of permanent closure.  These small businesses, restaurants, shops, and manufacturers employ  nearly half of this country's workers and form the backbone of  communities all across the country. Fortunately, the provisions in  today's relief package will bring critical assistance to these workers  and their families.  The Paycheck Protection Program, which has supported over 50 million  employees, will be reopened for new and second-time applicants. Funds  will be reserved for very small businesses and community lenders. The  list of eligible expenses will be expanded so that small business  owners can purchase PPE, for example, to keep employees and their loved  ones safe.  There are many more details in the package, too many to go into here.  But the bottom line is this: These provisions will bring meaningful  help to millions of Americans.  Just in my district in Cincinnati and the surrounding area, a PPP  loan helped keep 140 employees on the payroll at the Silver Spring  House restaurant. A PPP loan enabled HomeWell Care Services, an  assisted living facility, to continue their important work for our  community's elderly population. And the folks at Neyer Plumbing used  PPP funding to carry on as an essential business.  These are real people with real families to support and bills to pay.  That is why it is so important that we pass this package without  additional delay.  Small businesses and their employees are tough; they are resilient.  Across the country, we hear stories about small businesses giving back  to their communities, even when they are struggling themselves.  It is time for Congress to meet the moment and get further help in  the hands of working Americans. As a matter of fact, it is far overdue.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this long- overdue legislation.    "
79,Liz Cheney,0.15109007060527802,R,cheney,cheney," Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this NDAA conference  report named after a true American patriot, our Armed Services  Committee Ranking Member Mac Thornberry, whom we will very much miss  and who has dedicated his career to serving this Nation.  Mr. Speaker, I also thank the chairman of our committee, Mr. Smith,  for his work on this bipartisan product.  Congress has no greater responsibility, Mr. Speaker, than providing  for the defense of our Nation.  At a time when the United States faces the most complex array of  threats in our history, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that our  servicemembers have the tools they need to deter and defeat our  adversaries.  The 2021 defense bill before us today makes critical progress towards  modernizing our military, supporting our military families, protecting  supply chains, and deterring Russia and China.  At this crucial moment when we have troops deployed overseas,  including those from Wyoming's 153rd, 187th, and 243rd Air National  Guard units, it is imperative that they have the full support of the  United States Congress behind them as they execute their missions.  Failure to pass this act would force hundreds of thousands of our men  and women in uniform and their families to endure cuts to their pay  right before the holidays. Over 250,000 military families would lose  their hazardous duty pay.  Given the sacrifices they make for all of us, our troops should never  have their livelihoods threatened by political battles in Washington,  D.C.  In addition to all that this NDAA does to support our troops, it also  builds on the Trump administration's successful efforts to counter the  Chinese Communist Party, including through provisions I authored that  require publication of the names of Chinese Communist military  companies operating in the United States.  It also includes my bipartisan provision seeking to reduce DOD's  dependence on China for critical rare earth minerals. States like  Wyoming are blessed with these resources, and we must rebuild our  Nation's capacity to mine and process rare earths here at home.  This legislation funds the modernization of our nuclear triad and  contains crucial provisions to strengthen our deterrence capability in  the Indo-Pacific.  American security requires that we maintain a military that is second  to none, that we arm our troops with the world's best equipment, and  that we provide for their families. Our men and women in uniform put  their lives on the line to defend our freedom. We owe them the tools to  do their job.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this year's NDAA, and I urge all  my colleagues to vote for it.    "

This Act may be cited as the ``Bankruptcy Administration   Improvement Act of 2020''.  SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:  (1) Because of the importance of the goal that the   bankruptcy system is self-funded, at no cost to the taxpayer,   Congress has closely monitored the funding needs of the   bankruptcy system, including by requiring periodic reporting   by the Attorney General regarding the United States Trustee   System Fund.  (2) Congress has amended the various bankruptcy fees as   necessary to ensure that the bankruptcy system remains self-  supporting, while also fairly allocating the costs of the   system among those who use the system.  (3) Because the bankruptcy system is interconnected, the   result has been a system of fees, including filing fees,   quarterly fees in chapter 11 cases, and other fees, that   together fund the courts, judges, United States trustees, and   chapter 7 case trustees necessary for the bankruptcy system   to function.  (4) This Act and the amendments made by this Act--  (A) ensure adequate funding of the United States trustees,   supports the preservation of existing bankruptcy judgeships   that are urgently needed to handle existing and anticipated   increases in business and consumer caseloads, and provides   long-overdue additional compensation for chapter 7 case   trustees whose caseloads include chapter 11 reorganization   cases that were converted to chapter 7 liquidation cases; and  (B) confirm the longstanding intention of Congress that   quarterly fee requirements remain consistent across all   Federal judicial districts.  (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act and the amendments   made by this Act is to further the long-standing goal of   Congress of ensuring that the bankruptcy system is self-  funded, at no cost to the taxpayer.

81,Katherine Clark,0.15904217958450317,D,clark,clark," Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, House Democrats took the  necessary action to defeat this virus and restore the economy in May,  but Mitch McConnell said let's hit the pause button. So Americans have  waited 7 long months for the GOP to take action to end their suffering.  As over 300,000 Americans lost their lives, they said more testing  was not necessary.  As veterans and children waited in lines at food banks, they proposed  a tax credit for business lunches.  As 8 million more Americans fell into poverty, they proposed cutting  unemployment benefits.  As one out of four women have lost their jobs and have left the  workforce, they fought to limit paid leave and access to childcare.  As 40 million Americans teeter on the verge of homelessness, they  fought to shield corporations from negligence and deny workers basic  safety protections.  This bill is too little too late, but it is a lifesaving bridge to a  better time and a new President who will focus on restoring Americans'  jobs and their health.    "
82,Yvette Clarke,0.9882755875587463,D,clarke,clarke," Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  Uterine Fibroids Awareness Month.  Uterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors that affect an estimated 26  million women between the ages of 15 and 50 in the United States.  As vice chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee and a survivor of  uterine fibroids myself, I know that increasing awareness about uterine  fibroids is critical to our efforts to address the national maternity  mortality crisis and prevent pregnancy-related deaths.  While more than 80 percent of African Americans and 70 percent of  Caucasians develop fibroids by the time they reach menopause,  hospitalization rates for uterine fibroids are three times higher for  African American women and twice as high for Latina women. However, the  exact number of affected women is unknown because it is difficult for  healthcare providers to detect and accurately diagnose this condition.  This issue has not received the attention or funding it deserves.  This is why I was proud to introduce ', H.R. 6383, ', the Uterine Fibroid  Research and Education Act of 2020.  This awareness month is an opportunity to cast the spotlight on the  forgotten issue that impacts the lives of women of color.    "
83,Emanuel Cleaver,1.721877098083496,D,cleaver,cleaver," Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise to commemorate and thank Blake  Hurst for his service to the Missouri Farm Bureau and to Missouri's  agriculture community.  Blake is a well-respected gentleman throughout the State of Missouri,  not just in my home district, the Fifth. He is well known in the ag  community, serving as president of the Missouri Farm Bureau since 2010  and vice president and district board member before that.  I can attest to Blake's kindness and open-mindedness because he has  worked with this urban representative from Kansas City. For 10 years,  Blake has reached out to develop a relationship and partnership as we  work together to do things for our district.  He understands the symbiosis that exists between rural areas and  urban ones. He knows the importance of making sure that all families  can put food on their tables.  I wish Blake well on his retirement as president of the Missouri Farm  Bureau, but I know that as a farmer, he will keep busy with his family  farm in northwest Missouri and their wholesale greenhouse business.    "
84,Ben Cline,0.8596439957618713,R,cline,cline," Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Rockbridge  Christmas Baskets program.  Originally founded as the Santa Clause Truck, the Rockbridge  Christmas Baskets program has been a blessing to the Shenandoah Valley  since 1948.  This tremendous, all-volunteer organization assembles and delivers  thousands of food and toy care packages to struggling families each  year.  While the coronavirus may have put a damper on the holiday season for  some, it was no match for the generosity and spirit of the folks at the  Rockbridge Christmas Baskets program. Moving their packing day to a  larger facility and spreading it out over packing week to ensure the  health of those involved, the organization will donate a record 68,000  pounds of food and 1,300 toys to families throughout Lexington,  Rockbridge, and Buena Vista this year.  Having worked side by side with this incredible group many times,  along with my family, I can tell you it is the overwhelming community  effort that makes it such a success--plus the doughnut holes they  serve.  Folks coming together from all walks of life to help their neighbors  in need truly embodies the spirit of the holiday season, and I thank  the Rockbridge Christmas Baskets program for their continued efforts to  bring cheer to so many in our area.    "
85,Michael Cloud,0.3385578691959381,R,cloud,cloud," Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Mrs.  Susan Day, a beloved teacher in the Corpus Christi community who passed  away on October 5, 2020.  Mrs. Day was a passionate and dedicated educator at Calallen High  School who retired this past May after 36 years of service to our  community. Students and parents alike described her as devoted,  energetic, and inspiring. She would challenge her students with quality  education while encouraging them with her enthusiasm and charm.  The students of Calallen High School tell stories of the many  experiences she gave them, including coaching the Calallen Challenge  Team to three wins in the local TV quiz show.  The English department chose to recognize her with a plaque declaring  the English hallway, a place she had spent so much time with her  students, to be the Susan Day Hallway.  Susan Day was an amazing member of our community who has touched the  lives of hundreds of students, parents, and teachers.  I offer my condolences to her family, friends, and students as they  grieve the loss of a great woman. She will be fondly remembered by all  for the investment and impact she has made in the lives of so many  students.    "
86,James Clyburn,0.8380640745162964,D,clyburn,clyburn," Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, while today's vote to provide relief to  families who are suffering due to circumstances far beyond their  control is welcome, it is long overdue and insufficient to fully meet  their needs.  Democrats put forth our priorities last May to bring relief to those  who are sick, unemployed, homeless, and hungry. Republicans instead  chose to ignore and obfuscate the widespread suffering.  This short-term package will provide direct payments and unemployment  benefits extension and some assistance to help families afford rent,  food, water, and broadband. I applaud our Speaker for negotiating these  critical provisions and my colleagues who came together in a bipartisan  way to drive this compromise, but this package must be viewed only as a  downpayment.  Most of us can hardly wait to begin the new year with renewed hope.  Our resolve as we come into 2021 with a new Congress and a new  administration is to provide the leadership and support Americans need  and deserve to get us beyond this pandemic. There can be no greater  pursuit in 2021.    "

It is  also cosponsored by 43 of our colleagues in the House of  Representatives and nine Senators.  This bill would begin the process to establish a Julius Rosenwald &  Rosenwald Schools National Historical Park to focus on the incredible  impact of Julius Rosenwald, a successful entrepreneur and renowned  philanthropist who made lasting contributions to the advancement of  African American education during the twentieth century.  Mr. Rosenwald was the President of Sears, Roebuck & Company who used  his fortune to enhance the lives of others--establishing museums,  community centers, and housing as well as helping Jews in Europe and  new immigrants to the U.S. Moved by Booker T. Washington's  autobiography Up from Slavery, Mr. Rosenwald committed his time and  finances to improving the lives of African Americans. Notably, he  established the Julius Rosenwald Fund that partnered with local  communities to create over 5,300 schools in the south to address the  lack of education for African Americans. During the 1920s, 1930s, and  1940s, one-third of all African American children in the south were  educated in Rosenwald schools. A 2011 study by two Federal Reserve  economists concluded that the schools played a significant role in  narrowing the education gap between black and white students in the  south.  In addition, Mr. Rosenwald provided matching funds to communities for  construction of YMCA's for African Americans during the Jim Crow era.  The Rosenwald Fund supported the early NAACP cases that eventually led  to the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, provided fellowship to  African Americans in the arts and sciences, and supported a number of  Historically Black Colleges and Universities, including Fisk, Dillard,  and Howard. Mr. Rosenwald improved the lives of those in Chicago as  well, creating the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago and the  Museum of Science and Industry among many other local initiatives. When  I was seven years old, our first family vacation was to my mother's  hometown of Chicago. During that trip, we went to the Museum of Science  and Industry, which my mother and others referred to as ``the  Rosenwald.'' That memory led me to dig into the life of Julius  Rosenwald as an adult. My dear and late friend, Julian Bond, told me  about the Rosenwald schools and that furthered my appreciation of this  man's farsightedness, empathy and wisdom.  The esteemed contralto singer Marian Anderson, discriminated against  in the Jim Crow South, won a prestigious Julius Rosenwald Fellowship  that allowed her to tour Europe, entertaining heads of state, making  headlines in American newspapers and creating ``Marian Mania'' around  the world. Returning to the United States, she was invited by President  Franklin Roosevelt and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt to play the White  House in 1936 and, famously, sang ``My Country 'Tis of Thee'' from the  steps of the Lincoln Memorial on Easter Sunday 1939 after being denied  the stage of the Daughters of the American Revolution Constitution Hall  by segregationists.  The documentary, ``Rosenwald,'' by Aviva Kempner was a fitting  tribute to Julius Rosenwald. I was privileged to be present for a  showing at the White House East Wing when Barack Obama was president  and Valerie Jarrett was his senior advisor. Ms. Jarrett's maternal  grandfather, Robert Rochon Taylor, was involved in carrying on the  legacy of Julius Rosenwald by helping to plan, build and manage what  became known as Rosenwald Courts, a multiunit housing complex in  Bonzeville.  Julius Rosenwald was a visionary philanthropist whose altruism--and  philosophy of giving embodied the Jewish concept of tzedakah--social  justice and charity. It's past time to ensure his legacy receives its  due place in history. I urge my colleagues to support the swift passage  of the Julius Rosenwald and Rosenwald Schools Study Act.    "
88,Tom Cole,0.34849801659584045,R,cole,cole," Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to have the Labor, Health  and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies' bill included in  this important appropriations package. As we have done every year since  I have served on the subcommittee, we have been able to reach a  compromise. I want to highlight a few of the many provisions in the  Labor-HHS section of the bill.  The agreement boosts funding for the National Institutes of Health by  $1.25 billion. I am proud to say this increase represents the sixth  straight year of sustained increases for the NIH, thanks to bipartisan  and bicameral support.  And funding resources, expertise, and investments we have made over  the past 6 years in biomedical research, along with public health  planning through mechanisms like the Infectious Disease Rapid Response  Reserve Fund, are helping us come out of this pandemic faster than  predicted.  Make no mistake, this is not an accident. It is a result of years of  quiet investment, planning, and scientific dedication. I am glad this  conference agreement continues these investments in biomedical  research. It will benefit the Nation.  Finally, the bill also funds the President's childhood cancer  initiative and continues support to end the HIV epidemic.  This conference agreement before us today also increases funding for  education and training programs, including $52 million for an increase  in career and technical education, a $10 million increase for TRIO and  GEAR UP. We have increased funds for Impact Aid and special education  and provided funds for veterans to integrate back into the workforce.  Finally, the bill continues existing funding restrictions, including  those important to the pro-life community, and drops new controversial  language.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to conclude by thanking Ranking Member Kay  Granger and Labor, Health and Human Services Chair Rosa DeLauro. Ms.  Granger has been a valiant leader navigating our members through some  difficult decisions to bring us here today.  Mr. Speaker, I also want to acknowledge the negotiating skills of the  chair of the Labor-HHS Subcommittee, Ms. DeLauro. I very much look  forward to serving with her as both the chair of my subcommittee, as  well as the chair of the full committee in the next Congress.  Last, but certainly not least, I also want to thank our full  committee chair, Mrs. Lowey, who has had an outstanding career and  navigated us to this point.    "
89,Chris Collins,0.09940135478973389,R,collins,collins," Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:37 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, December 23, 2019, at 10 a.m.    "
90,Chris Collins,0.09940135478973389,R,collins,collins," Mrs. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from  Arizona, Senator Sinema, in introducing legislation to support the  operation of a national child abuse hotline. Of all the major national  help hotlines, the crisis line for child abuse and neglect, which is  currently operated by a national nonprofit, is the only one without a  federal authorization and dedicated federal funding. Our bill, the  National Child Abuse Help Hotline Act of 2020, would give the  Administration for Children and Families the authority to award a grant  to a national nonprofit to support a hotline dedicated to the  prevention and intervention of child abuse and neglect. The child abuse  and neglect crisis happening across the United States has only been  exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.  On average, five children die every day from child abuse and neglect.  According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Child  Maltreatment Report, which was published in January 2020 and reflects  2018 figures, 678,000 children were victims of maltreatment in 2018 and  a heartbreaking 1,770 children died--including three in Maine. These  statistics reflect an unfortunate increase in both child fatalities and  victims of maltreatment, and is the first increase for the number of  victims who suffered maltreatment since 2015.  Access to prevention and intervention services nationwide has only  become more critical in the face of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The  current crisis threatens to severely exacerbate child abuse and  neglect, and a number of experts predict that child abuse is currently  being underreported. In Maine, when schools closed their doors on March  16 and stay-at-home orders went in place, calls to Maine Child and  Family Services decreased immediately, falling 32 percent in the first  month. Of note, only seven percent of calls were from school personnel,  which is a dramatic drop from the 22 percent of teachers and other  school staff--more than any other group--who call in typically to  report abuse and neglect.  With stay-at-home orders, school closures, and high unemployment,  families are experiencing financial stress, isolation, and new  anxieties at the very time when children have less exposure to  mandatory reporters--such as teachers, physicians, and coaches--and  safe environments where one may normally escape or seek help. In April,  Dr. Larry Ricci, a child abuse pediatrician at Spurwink, located in  Portland, Maine, said ``our sense is that not only is abuse still  happening at the same rate it was happening before, in all likelihood  it has increased.'' Dr. Ricci pointed out that ``We've known for many  years that the abuse rate mirrors the unemployment rate.'' And as  Michelle Fingerman, Vice President for Childhelp, a national nonprofit  and the current operator of the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline  located in Arizona, details: ``There is a wide range of fallout from  pandemic anxiety and school shutdowns. There is more abuse already  occurring in homes where caregivers are melting down from the stress,  children are trapped at home with abusers, schools and daycare are  closed, and therapists and other frontline providers are now more  difficult to access.''  During a time when children are not going to school, day care, or  family resource centers, and, therefore, traditional resources may not  be as easily accessible, the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline is  a resource that is accessible to children and families across the  country. The hotline, 1-800-4-A-CHILD, saw call volume increase by 33  percent from February to May. Childhelp's text and online chat  platform, which is supported by a $1 million ACF Innovation Grant that  I have advocated for as a member of the Appropriations Committee,  experienced a 66 percent increase in outreach since February.  The helpline importantly serves a wide range of individuals in every  single state--at-risk children, distressed parents seeking crisis  intervention, and concerned individuals who suspect that child abuse  may be occurring. In Maine, where one in every 71 children is a victim  of abuse, the National Child Abuse Hotline assisted nearly 200 callers  in fiscal year 2019. Those in need are connected--either on the phone  or by text or online chat--with masters-level social workers who are  there to offer confidential crisis intervention and information,  literature, and referrals to emergency, social service, and support  resources.  The bill we are introducing today would provide a small but  meaningful federal investment to protect children across the country-- authorizing $1 million annually for the Administration for Children and  Families (ACF) to award a grant to a nonprofit entity to support a 24- hour, national, toll-free telephone hotline that will provide  information and assistance to victims of [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S4547"">Page S4547</a>, ] child abuse or neglect, parents, caregivers, mandated reporters, and  other concerned community members. This does not interfere with any  state-mandated reporter hotlines and can be a resource for these  individuals. In fact, the current operator has more than 80 community  partners in just Maine alone.  The helpline's dedication to the prevention and intervention of child  abuse and neglect is both successful and well-documented, and more  federal support for this resource will improve our ability to reach  children of all ages, as well as parents or caregivers in need. During  a time when these supports are needed more there an ever, I believe the  existing infrastructure and experience of the National Child Abuse  Hotline should be used. Even with just more outreach and  communications, we could better support the needs of children and  families during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and economic recovery.  Action and investment now can help prevent the worst possible outcome-- letting children fall through the cracks during an already traumatizing  crisis.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to put the welfare of our  nation's children at the forefront of our national Covid-19 response  and to support the adoption of this important legislation, which will  benefit children and families in the age of Covid-19, as well as after  this pandemic passes.  Thank you, Mr. President.    "
91,Chris Collins,0.09940135478973389,R,collins,collins," Mr. COLLINS. Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, it has been interesting, the discussion on the floor  today. It has been interesting on both sides to hear the different  aspects of why this bill is on the floor, why we are doing it, why we  shouldn't be doing it, and many things. It has been interesting, the  discussion, if you go from a strictly number-of-States category.  What has been interesting is my colleagues across the aisle have  talked about that there are now 38 States, but they fail to mention 5  States that rescinded their votes. Five States would put you under 38.  What was interesting to me in the Rules Committee the other night,  the argument was that, if they rescind it, it is not valid to rescind,  yet you can add States after the time limit is up. That is an  interesting argument to make if you are actually looking at it from the  perspective of if they rescind it within the timeframe yet passed it  after the timeframe, that that is okay.  Then I heard one of my colleagues actually mentioned the fact that,  if we passed it in here today, that this would now become part of the  process, along with the State of Virginia ratifying it, it is now part  of our Constitution.  I am sure this was just a euphoric discussion about how this would  actually go about, but they were also forgetting the Senate is involved  in this. It is amazing.  I was really worried at one point in the discussion that it was said  on multiple occasions that there was no protection in the Constitution  for women. I was almost scared for a moment that the 14th Amendment had  been repealed and I didn't know it.  It is in there and still is in there. I checked just a few minutes  ago. It is safe.  It is interesting to determine, when Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the  foremost architects in looking at this bill even in the 1970s, coming  forward, has said: If you want to do this, start over. Do it the proper  way.  As my chairman has said earlier, basically, a deadline should not get  in the way of what we want. A deadline should not get in the way of  what I want to have happen. That is becoming more and more of a concern  in this body, that the rules and parliamentary procedures don't matter  if it interferes with what we want.  But, at the end of the day, the question really becomes: Why are we  doing this? Why are we bringing this forth when there is absolutely no  legal precedent, no constitutional precedent, no anything out there-- including some of the founders who actually started this whole process  40-plus years ago, who said this is not the way you do it.  The reason I know that that is a concern is because some of those who  have actually said this have been criticized in the media from the  perspective of supporters of the ERA to say Ruth Bader Ginsburg's  comments have now killed the ERA, or effectively done it. The reason is  because she is speaking the truth about this issue.  We disagree on most everything from a legal perspective, but on this  one, we happen to agree, and she has laid forth clearly what should  happen here.  But let me also say--and it has been talked about a great deal, so I  think we just need to come to the real scenario why this is happening.  It is not that we believe it will actually happen. For anybody here who  believes that today is actually going to put it in part of the  Constitution, that is not going to happen.  So what is it? It is a political nod to the understanding of those  who are speaking for this.  As we have heard earlier, NARAL Pro-Choice America:  With its ratification, the ERA would reinforce the   constitutional right to abortion by clarifying that the sexes   have equal rights, which would require judges to strike down   anti-abortion laws.  Also, NARAL:  The ERA will support protecting women's right to abortion.   With five anti-choice Justices on the Supreme Court and Roe   v. Wade on the chopping block, it is more important than ever   we codify women's bodily autonomy in our lives.  Codirector of Reproaction:  Abortion restrictions amount to sex discrimination because   they single out people for unfair treatment on the basis of   sex.  The senior counsel of National Women's Law Center:  The ERA would help create a basis for challenging abortion   restrictions.  This is what this is actually about. This is what the basis has  needed because there has been a shifting in this [["", Page , H1140, ] country to understand that, in our opinion--in the opinion of many-- abortion is simply murder in the womb. It is not about life.  It is interesting, we are talking about the rights of women today-- which, again, this bill doesn't have anything to do with--but we are  not concerned if the young women in the womb are even able to have a  birthday. That is not a concern.  So what would happen from these folks who are supporting your  resolution today? Why do they want it? Because it gives a claim, from  start to finish, unfettered abortion.  So what does that mean? That means let's bring back partial-birth  abortion, which, if I have to remind anybody here, means the delivery  of the child all the way until the moment the chin comes almost out,  and then actually crushing their skull. That is what that is.  If that is a right we are protecting, I don't want any part of it,  and neither do most Americans. They don't want a part of it. But that  is one of those restrictions that will be laid back.  It would also continue to allow unlimited abortions in any State for  any reason, including sex selection.  It is interesting that we would talk about this today, the ERA, and  use this, yet a family could choose to abort a child because it is a  male or a female. Let's be honest about this.  But the bottom line for me, what really bothers me the most about  when it is unlimited, unfettered access to abortion that this bill  opens up, if it were to have passed, is one that hits close to home for  me.  You see, a European country recently stated that a geneticist in  Iceland said: We have almost basically eradicated Down syndrome people.  I thought to myself, for a second: That would be great. I mean, if we  could actually remove Down syndrome and help those and cure that, that  would be an amazing medical discovery for all people. Except there is  one portion.  Do you know how they have done it? Through genetic testing and  killing the children in the womb. They don't even let them have a  birthday.  One Icelandic counselor counsels mothers as follows:  This is your life. You have the right to choose how your life will  look. She said: We don't look at abortion as murder. We look at it as a  thing that we ended.  Do you want to know why this has opened up, America? This is why.  And for those of us like myself who have a disabled child, I do not  want to hear that we are protecting disabled rights and other rights  when we are not even allowing them to be born in certain arenas.  Every day, I get a text on this phone. It is from my daughter. Jordan  is 27 years old. She has spina bifida. She cannot walk and has never  taken a step, and I believe it probably, given the medical condition,  will not happen this side of Heaven. But she rolls and she smiles. She  goes to work 3 days a week. She gets herself up early to put her  clothes on and take her shower and get a bus that she calls, and she  goes to work.  The folks in Sweden, do you know what they want to do? Kill her.  Because she is not as valuable, as a Down syndrome child is not as  valuable.  Do you want to open this Pandora's box of no abortion restrictions?  Then own what you are doing.  But when Jordan texts me, she texts me: Good morning, Daddy. I love  you. How was your day?  Madam Speaker, when we found out 27 years ago--a week ago, 27 years  ago--that Jordan was going to have spina bifida, we were a young couple  just happy that God gave us a child, and to find out that she had a  disability only kept our hearts more in tune to what God had given.  My wife went to school the next week, and she was telling the teacher  about what was going on. She said: We are trying to figure out where we  need to go to have Jordan, help when she is born and get some more  medical attention.  This person looked at her and said: You know you have choices,  correct?''  And my wife said: Well, yes. There is Northside Hospital and others.  She said: No. Oh, no, dear. You don't have to go through with this.  That is your choice.  {time} 1045  In other words, as my wife looked at her and said: ``You're talking  about my baby.''  You see, when we go down this path, don't flower this bill up. Look  at the ones who actually talk about it and say this is an open door to  abortion on demand, with no restrictions, no government interference-- in fact, government pays for it.  But before you do that, America, as we look around, I want you to  think of the picture on the new Gerber baby ad of the young person with  Down syndrome, who is now the face of Gerber baby food. If he was in  Iceland, he would have been one of those that, as it said: Oh, we  ended.  Think about my daughter, who, when we allow it out there for people  who are struggling--and to get news that you have a child with a  disability, that is one of the most amazingly devastating things that  you can hear because you don't know what the future holds.  But what you do know is life is a gift from God, and that it is my  joy to take care of her. We had 30 major surgeries before she was 5  years old, three of which were 9 hours in length. Tell me her life  doesn't matter.  For someone who doesn't have the possibility of understanding, and  they are given a choice because they have a disability, and somebody  tells them and gets to them and says: Don't worry. Disabilities are  bad. Just go ahead and end that life, and go on with your life.  This is what this opens up.  So don't give me a bill that is going nowhere for the reasons that  have been given. The true reasons are found in your own supporters. The  true reasons are found in what we know to be true.  When you understand what this is about, then I will stand till I have  no more breath in my body for the rights of those who can't speak for  themselves.  It is amazing to me that it was said: What would I be saying to my  daughter if I voted against this?  I would be saying to Jordan, as I will: Jordan, the 14th Amendment is  still there. Protections in law are still there. And by the way,  restrictions on abortion will not be done away with, and your life  matters.  So if you want a picture of this, picture Jordan.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
92,Chris Collins,0.09940135478973389,R,collins,collins," Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, in the quest of their further  radical agenda, the left has cast a shadow over an entire town in  Georgia.  This is more than just political fodder here for this floor when the  majority has nothing else to put on this floor and is wasting the  American people's time here. This goes back to disparaging a respected  doctor in the community, an Indian-American immigrant, who provides  free medical services to low-income patients simply for political gain.  The doctor has been viciously slandered by the left's accusation that  he carried out mass hysterectomies.  Frankly, he should sue these organizations.  It is truly sad to see the lengths that the majority is willing to go  to advance their own misguided policies, and they should apologize to  the doctor and to the center.  It is clear to me that Project South has ulterior motives, and it is  dangerous that the majority is permitting the group's complaint to  serve as the foundation of a resolution when so many of the claims have  already failed under scrutiny, and the credibility of the entire  complaint is shattered by Project South's anti-ICE motives.  Despite Democrats' wishes, the American people deserve to know the  truth, and they deserve to see the motives behind the claim. An  investigation is always there; an investigation can start. But it is  pretty amazing that the investigation--173 of my majority colleagues  rushed to sign a letter without even knowing the facts, and especially  because it has salacious details that they could get at ICE and to get  at a system that they don't like, actually protecting the American  public, enforcing our immigration laws.  Project South is an anti-law enforcement organization that has a  stated mission of shutting down detention facilities. They included  patently false claims in a complaint to the DHS IG.  Detention facilities like the Irwin County Detention Center serve an  important purpose in upholding our Nation's immigration laws, and  efforts like this one to disparage them and shut them down by choosing  to ignore facts in favor of fiction is disgraceful, not even meeting  with the hospital administrator.  Again, what are we here for? This is shown to be exactly what it is.  This train is on the tracks. We are putting this up here for political  purposes because, frankly, Madam Speaker, the majority has nothing else  to put up, so let's get a last couple of days in to throw at our  favorite targets: ICE and this administration. And who cares who we  hurt, a hospital, a community, and a doctor who simply was doing his  job.  This is an investigation that needs to happen, and the smear needs to  stop now.    "
93,Chris Collins,0.09940135478973389,R,collins,collins," Mr. COLLINS of New York. Madam Speaker, today I rise to commemorate  the 100th anniversary of Boy Scout Troop 578, one of the oldest troops  in our Nation.  Troop 578 was chartered on September 11, 1919, by the First Church of  Evans in Derby, New York. Historically, they were known as Troop 78,  and, unlike any other Boy Scout troop in America, they remained active  during World War II. During that war, these Scouts were official  dispatch bearers, and they collected recycled metals and other goods to  support the war effort.  In the 1950s, redistricting changes required the troop to add a  number 5 to the 78, making them Troop 578, as they are known today.  As an Eagle Scout myself, I am proud to honor Troop 578 as they  continue to be an important part of the western New York community and  Scouting history. I wish Troop 578 many more active years of Scouting. [[', Page , H7587, ]      "

The helpline's dedication to the prevention and intervention of child  abuse and neglect is both successful and well-documented, and more  federal support for this resource will improve our ability to reach  children of all ages, as well as parents or caregivers in need. During  a time when these supports are needed more there an ever, I believe the  existing infrastructure and experience of the National Child Abuse  Hotline should be used. Even with just more outreach and  communications, we could better support the needs of children and  families during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and economic recovery.  Action and investment now can help prevent the worst possible outcome-- letting children fall through the cracks during an already traumatizing  crisis.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to put the welfare of our  nation's children at the forefront of our national Covid-19 response  and to support the adoption of this important legislation, which will  benefit children and families in the age of Covid-19, as well as after  this pandemic passes.  Thank you, Mr. President.    "
96,Doug Collins,1.31859290599823,R,collins,collins," Mr. COLLINS. Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, it has been interesting, the discussion on the floor  today. It has been interesting on both sides to hear the different  aspects of why this bill is on the floor, why we are doing it, why we  shouldn't be doing it, and many things. It has been interesting, the  discussion, if you go from a strictly number-of-States category.  What has been interesting is my colleagues across the aisle have  talked about that there are now 38 States, but they fail to mention 5  States that rescinded their votes. Five States would put you under 38.  What was interesting to me in the Rules Committee the other night,  the argument was that, if they rescind it, it is not valid to rescind,  yet you can add States after the time limit is up. That is an  interesting argument to make if you are actually looking at it from the  perspective of if they rescind it within the timeframe yet passed it  after the timeframe, that that is okay.  Then I heard one of my colleagues actually mentioned the fact that,  if we passed it in here today, that this would now become part of the  process, along with the State of Virginia ratifying it, it is now part  of our Constitution.  I am sure this was just a euphoric discussion about how this would  actually go about, but they were also forgetting the Senate is involved  in this. It is amazing.  I was really worried at one point in the discussion that it was said  on multiple occasions that there was no protection in the Constitution  for women. I was almost scared for a moment that the 14th Amendment had  been repealed and I didn't know it.  It is in there and still is in there. I checked just a few minutes  ago. It is safe.  It is interesting to determine, when Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the  foremost architects in looking at this bill even in the 1970s, coming  forward, has said: If you want to do this, start over. Do it the proper  way.  As my chairman has said earlier, basically, a deadline should not get  in the way of what we want. A deadline should not get in the way of  what I want to have happen. That is becoming more and more of a concern  in this body, that the rules and parliamentary procedures don't matter  if it interferes with what we want.  But, at the end of the day, the question really becomes: Why are we  doing this? Why are we bringing this forth when there is absolutely no  legal precedent, no constitutional precedent, no anything out there-- including some of the founders who actually started this whole process  40-plus years ago, who said this is not the way you do it.  The reason I know that that is a concern is because some of those who  have actually said this have been criticized in the media from the  perspective of supporters of the ERA to say Ruth Bader Ginsburg's  comments have now killed the ERA, or effectively done it. The reason is  because she is speaking the truth about this issue.  We disagree on most everything from a legal perspective, but on this  one, we happen to agree, and she has laid forth clearly what should  happen here.  But let me also say--and it has been talked about a great deal, so I  think we just need to come to the real scenario why this is happening.  It is not that we believe it will actually happen. For anybody here who  believes that today is actually going to put it in part of the  Constitution, that is not going to happen.  So what is it? It is a political nod to the understanding of those  who are speaking for this.  As we have heard earlier, NARAL Pro-Choice America:  With its ratification, the ERA would reinforce the   constitutional right to abortion by clarifying that the sexes   have equal rights, which would require judges to strike down   anti-abortion laws.  Also, NARAL:  The ERA will support protecting women's right to abortion.   With five anti-choice Justices on the Supreme Court and Roe   v. Wade on the chopping block, it is more important than ever   we codify women's bodily autonomy in our lives.  Codirector of Reproaction:  Abortion restrictions amount to sex discrimination because   they single out people for unfair treatment on the basis of   sex.  The senior counsel of National Women's Law Center:  The ERA would help create a basis for challenging abortion   restrictions.  This is what this is actually about. This is what the basis has  needed because there has been a shifting in this [["", Page , H1140, ] country to understand that, in our opinion--in the opinion of many-- abortion is simply murder in the womb. It is not about life.  It is interesting, we are talking about the rights of women today-- which, again, this bill doesn't have anything to do with--but we are  not concerned if the young women in the womb are even able to have a  birthday. That is not a concern.  So what would happen from these folks who are supporting your  resolution today? Why do they want it? Because it gives a claim, from  start to finish, unfettered abortion.  So what does that mean? That means let's bring back partial-birth  abortion, which, if I have to remind anybody here, means the delivery  of the child all the way until the moment the chin comes almost out,  and then actually crushing their skull. That is what that is.  If that is a right we are protecting, I don't want any part of it,  and neither do most Americans. They don't want a part of it. But that  is one of those restrictions that will be laid back.  It would also continue to allow unlimited abortions in any State for  any reason, including sex selection.  It is interesting that we would talk about this today, the ERA, and  use this, yet a family could choose to abort a child because it is a  male or a female. Let's be honest about this.  But the bottom line for me, what really bothers me the most about  when it is unlimited, unfettered access to abortion that this bill  opens up, if it were to have passed, is one that hits close to home for  me.  You see, a European country recently stated that a geneticist in  Iceland said: We have almost basically eradicated Down syndrome people.  I thought to myself, for a second: That would be great. I mean, if we  could actually remove Down syndrome and help those and cure that, that  would be an amazing medical discovery for all people. Except there is  one portion.  Do you know how they have done it? Through genetic testing and  killing the children in the womb. They don't even let them have a  birthday.  One Icelandic counselor counsels mothers as follows:  This is your life. You have the right to choose how your life will  look. She said: We don't look at abortion as murder. We look at it as a  thing that we ended.  Do you want to know why this has opened up, America? This is why.  And for those of us like myself who have a disabled child, I do not  want to hear that we are protecting disabled rights and other rights  when we are not even allowing them to be born in certain arenas.  Every day, I get a text on this phone. It is from my daughter. Jordan  is 27 years old. She has spina bifida. She cannot walk and has never  taken a step, and I believe it probably, given the medical condition,  will not happen this side of Heaven. But she rolls and she smiles. She  goes to work 3 days a week. She gets herself up early to put her  clothes on and take her shower and get a bus that she calls, and she  goes to work.  The folks in Sweden, do you know what they want to do? Kill her.  Because she is not as valuable, as a Down syndrome child is not as  valuable.  Do you want to open this Pandora's box of no abortion restrictions?  Then own what you are doing.  But when Jordan texts me, she texts me: Good morning, Daddy. I love  you. How was your day?  Madam Speaker, when we found out 27 years ago--a week ago, 27 years  ago--that Jordan was going to have spina bifida, we were a young couple  just happy that God gave us a child, and to find out that she had a  disability only kept our hearts more in tune to what God had given.  My wife went to school the next week, and she was telling the teacher  about what was going on. She said: We are trying to figure out where we  need to go to have Jordan, help when she is born and get some more  medical attention.  This person looked at her and said: You know you have choices,  correct?''  And my wife said: Well, yes. There is Northside Hospital and others.  She said: No. Oh, no, dear. You don't have to go through with this.  That is your choice.  {time} 1045  In other words, as my wife looked at her and said: ``You're talking  about my baby.''  You see, when we go down this path, don't flower this bill up. Look  at the ones who actually talk about it and say this is an open door to  abortion on demand, with no restrictions, no government interference-- in fact, government pays for it.  But before you do that, America, as we look around, I want you to  think of the picture on the new Gerber baby ad of the young person with  Down syndrome, who is now the face of Gerber baby food. If he was in  Iceland, he would have been one of those that, as it said: Oh, we  ended.  Think about my daughter, who, when we allow it out there for people  who are struggling--and to get news that you have a child with a  disability, that is one of the most amazingly devastating things that  you can hear because you don't know what the future holds.  But what you do know is life is a gift from God, and that it is my  joy to take care of her. We had 30 major surgeries before she was 5  years old, three of which were 9 hours in length. Tell me her life  doesn't matter.  For someone who doesn't have the possibility of understanding, and  they are given a choice because they have a disability, and somebody  tells them and gets to them and says: Don't worry. Disabilities are  bad. Just go ahead and end that life, and go on with your life.  This is what this opens up.  So don't give me a bill that is going nowhere for the reasons that  have been given. The true reasons are found in your own supporters. The  true reasons are found in what we know to be true.  When you understand what this is about, then I will stand till I have  no more breath in my body for the rights of those who can't speak for  themselves.  It is amazing to me that it was said: What would I be saying to my  daughter if I voted against this?  I would be saying to Jordan, as I will: Jordan, the 14th Amendment is  still there. Protections in law are still there. And by the way,  restrictions on abortion will not be done away with, and your life  matters.  So if you want a picture of this, picture Jordan.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
97,Doug Collins,1.31859290599823,R,collins,collins," Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, in the quest of their further  radical agenda, the left has cast a shadow over an entire town in  Georgia.  This is more than just political fodder here for this floor when the  majority has nothing else to put on this floor and is wasting the  American people's time here. This goes back to disparaging a respected  doctor in the community, an Indian-American immigrant, who provides  free medical services to low-income patients simply for political gain.  The doctor has been viciously slandered by the left's accusation that  he carried out mass hysterectomies.  Frankly, he should sue these organizations.  It is truly sad to see the lengths that the majority is willing to go  to advance their own misguided policies, and they should apologize to  the doctor and to the center.  It is clear to me that Project South has ulterior motives, and it is  dangerous that the majority is permitting the group's complaint to  serve as the foundation of a resolution when so many of the claims have  already failed under scrutiny, and the credibility of the entire  complaint is shattered by Project South's anti-ICE motives.  Despite Democrats' wishes, the American people deserve to know the  truth, and they deserve to see the motives behind the claim. An  investigation is always there; an investigation can start. But it is  pretty amazing that the investigation--173 of my majority colleagues  rushed to sign a letter without even knowing the facts, and especially  because it has salacious details that they could get at ICE and to get  at a system that they don't like, actually protecting the American  public, enforcing our immigration laws.  Project South is an anti-law enforcement organization that has a  stated mission of shutting down detention facilities. They included  patently false claims in a complaint to the DHS IG.  Detention facilities like the Irwin County Detention Center serve an  important purpose in upholding our Nation's immigration laws, and  efforts like this one to disparage them and shut them down by choosing  to ignore facts in favor of fiction is disgraceful, not even meeting  with the hospital administrator.  Again, what are we here for? This is shown to be exactly what it is.  This train is on the tracks. We are putting this up here for political  purposes because, frankly, Madam Speaker, the majority has nothing else  to put up, so let's get a last couple of days in to throw at our  favorite targets: ICE and this administration. And who cares who we  hurt, a hospital, a community, and a doctor who simply was doing his  job.  This is an investigation that needs to happen, and the smear needs to  stop now.    "
98,Doug Collins,1.31859290599823,R,collins,collins," Mr. COLLINS of New York. Madam Speaker, today I rise to commemorate  the 100th anniversary of Boy Scout Troop 578, one of the oldest troops  in our Nation.  Troop 578 was chartered on September 11, 1919, by the First Church of  Evans in Derby, New York. Historically, they were known as Troop 78,  and, unlike any other Boy Scout troop in America, they remained active  during World War II. During that war, these Scouts were official  dispatch bearers, and they collected recycled metals and other goods to  support the war effort.  In the 1950s, redistricting changes required the troop to add a  number 5 to the 78, making them Troop 578, as they are known today.  As an Eagle Scout myself, I am proud to honor Troop 578 as they  continue to be an important part of the western New York community and  Scouting history. I wish Troop 578 many more active years of Scouting. [[', Page , H7587, ]      "
99,James Comer,0.2670707404613495,R,comer,comer," Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk about the ongoing  investigation within the House Committee on Oversight and Reform among  oversight Republicans.  The minority--the Republicans--have requested several hearings, but  unfortunately, Chairwoman Maloney and the majority House Democrats are  uninterested or unwilling to comply. So we have taken it upon ourselves  to inquire and pretty much open up investigations with our staff, with  our investigators, and have taken data from our whistleblowers and  different stakeholders with each investigation.  We currently have caught a situation before the election, in  California, where--with the CARES Act--there was a part called the Help  America Vote Act that allocated funds for different States to educate  voters on how to vote. In other words, to educate voters on where their  precincts are and how to fill out an absentee ballot--things that are  perfectly legal and things that the Federal Government should fund, and  the State government should administer.  Mr. Speaker, within the rules--something that a lot of times my  friends on the other side of the aisle don't think apply to  themselves--but in the rules of the Help America Vote Act, it  specifically says what those Federal funds can and cannot be used for.  One of the things that it specifically says the Federal funds cannot be  used for is to get out the vote efforts.  But in California, which was awarded $35 million in the CARES Act of  Help America Vote Act funds, their Secretary of State Padilla took the  $35 million. The normal process would be to advertise bids for a  contract, but Secretary Padilla did what a lot of Democrat secretaries  of state--and unfortunately, some Republican secretaries of state did-- they said, Oh, there is a pandemic. We can't do this the normal way. We  have to do it a special way.  So he awarded this contract with no bid. There were plenty of vendors  that were interested in bidding on that contract but he awarded it to  one. And in the Help America Vote Act it specifically says that vendors  can't be partisan. That is common sense, right?  This contract that he awarded, a $35 million of our Federal taxpayer  funds in a no-bid process, the firm that received that contract was  called SKDKnickerbocker. I invite you right now to get your phone out  and put in ``SKDKnickerbocker,'' and look at their website.  It will pop up, and what you will see is a picture of Joe Biden and  Kamala Harris shaking hands. And it proudly says--on the very top of  the website--``We want to congratulate our clients, Joe Biden and  Kamala Harris, for changing America, and for winning.'' So this firm,  SKDKnickerbocker was clearly a partisan firm. This firm represented the  Biden campaign.  Now, my question to anyone interested in this--and I think most  taxpayers would be interested in this--obviously, the House Democrats  on the [["", Page , H6887, ] Committee on Oversight and Reform are uninterested in this, but if the  secretary of state awards a no-bid contract to a Joe Biden partisan  firm to get out to vote, do you really think they are going to target  Republican voters, or do you think they are going to target Democrat  voters? That is illegal.  Mr. Speaker, we have sent letters to Secretary Padilla asking him  what his intentions were and why he did not follow the law on this  contract. He has not replied. I have made this public. I went on the  Tucker Carlson Show a few months ago and brought this to the Nation's  attention. As a result of this, and our messaging and our inquiries,  the media in California has been writing about this.  The Sacramento Bee wrote just this past week that the California  comptroller has refused to pay the $35 million bill to SKDKnickerbocker  because they know there is a problem with this no-bid contract awarded  to a partisan firm that was Joe Biden's main digital firm to  microtarget certain voters in California.  Mr. Speaker, what I am asking for now is for the comptroller of  California to just go ahead and do the right thing and send that $35  million back to the Treasury. We don't want taxpayer dollars being  spent on improper, illegal, unethical, and partisan instances. And that  is what happened in California.  Now, another reason this isn't going to go away--I am not an expert  on California politics--but while I was waiting for my time to speak, I  read several things that said Secretary of State Padilla is the  frontrunner to fill Kamala Harris' seat for the U.S. Senate. I strongly  encourage the secretary of state to answer House Republicans' inquiries  on this issue, because if he doesn't answer it now and he does, in  fact, get confirmed to the U.S. Senate, he is probably going to have to  answer it in front of the Senate Committee on Ethics.  Now, one thing that I pledged to do when I became ranking member of  the House Committee on Oversight and Reform is, we weren't just going  to identify problems. We were going to try to represent the taxpayers,  and we weren't just going to identify instances of waste, fraud and  abuse, like this $35 million no-bid contract in California. We were  going to try to claw back that money--get the money back. It seems like  forever in Congress, Members of Congress do the right thing and they  identify wrongful spending, but nothing ever happens. No one is ever  held accountable. Certainly, the taxpayers never get their money back.  This is an instance we are not going to let up.  Mr. Speaker, we are operating in a huge deficit. We have to be  accountable for the taxpayers. That is the job of this Congress. The  Committee on Oversight and Reform is serious. The Republicans on the  Committee on Oversight and Reform are going in a new direction. Not  only are we going to identify problems, but we are going to try to  solve problems because we are going to get the backs of the American  taxpayer.  And I think I have clearly spelled out the problems with this  contract. And I believe that the fact that the comptroller in  California isn't willing to write that check for the bill, that proves  that there was a problem there. If anything I have said today is  incorrect, then I welcome Secretary Padilla to answer our inquiry. And  if anything I have said that was not right, I will apologize to the  secretary of state for that. But clearly, sitting there not responding,  is not helping the situation and, again, it is not going to go away.  Mr. Speaker, now another thing with this contract, I have spelled out  the problem that the State of California, the secretary of state has  with this $35 million no-bid contract. The next part of the problem  with this particular investigation is our committee has sent numerous  letters to a government agency that a lot of people probably never  heard of, called the Election Assistance Commission.  The Election Assistance Commission is a government agency,  bureaucracy, entity--whatever you want to call it--that is supposed to  be the watchdog for Federal funding pertaining to elections. They have  an inspector general. I have written--and on those letters, they were  signed by my colleague on the Committee on Oversight and Reform, Jody  Hice of Georgia, and the ranking member of the House Administration  Committee, Rodney Davis of Illinois--we have jointly written letters to  the Inspector General of the Election Assistance Commission for the  Inspector General to investigate this $35 million contract. We wrote  these letters weeks in advance of the November elections. And we have  gotten back form letters, kind of like form letters that we send out to  people that call our office every day and ask for things that we are  probably not going to be able to do. We always reply with nice form  letters. That is what the ranking members of the House Committee on  Oversight and Reform and the House Administration Committee got.  If the Election Assistance Commission can't investigate this one  thing in this election--and I am not even going to get into a debate  today about whether there were irregularities or not. That is not what  I am discussing today. I am discussing a specific irregularity that  involved taxpayer dollars.  {time} 1615  If the Election Assistance Commission inspector general cannot  investigate that and come up with an answer and say, ``Okay, the  Secretary the State was right,'' or, ``Okay, you were right, and the  money should be returned,'' if they can't get us an answer on that,  then the next step we are going to suggest, as Republican members of  the Committee on Oversight and Reform, will be to eliminate the  Election Assistance Commission.  If you can't take an inquiry from Congress and investigate it,  especially when the media in California--not exactly a bastion of  Republican support--when they are calling the Secretary of State out on  this contract, then I think we have a problem with this government  agency.  Government is too big. I have been in Washington 4 years now. There  are a lot of buildings in this city with a lot of government employees,  a lot of government programs. Honestly, in my opinion, we don't have  the ability to continue to fund all of these government programs, all  of these government agencies, and all of these government employees. If  we can find government agencies that refuse to do their jobs, then we  should eliminate those government agencies.  So, my remarks today are specifically about the contract in  California with the Secretary of State, the contract for the Help  America Vote Act, which was in the CARES Act, which was a no-bid  contract to a partisan firm to do illegal things, like microtarget  voters. That is my first complaint, the $35 million.  My second complaint is the Election Assistance Commission. With the  one request that we made, I have been very unimpressed, disappointed,  shocked, to the point now I am angered. Now, as a taxpayer and someone  who wants to get the back of the taxpayer, I think it is time to look  at this agency and say: Is this something that we need moving forward?  Mr. Speaker, I am going to conclude my remarks, again, with reference  to the Committee on Oversight and Reform. As a member of the committee  for the past 4 years, I have heard a lot of Democrats complain about  the 2016 election, imply that there were irregularities in the  election. I have heard my friend Debbie Wasserman Schultz complain,  probably rightfully so, about the emails being hacked at the Democratic  National Committee. We have had discussions about that.  I know that when Elijah Cummings became chairman of the committee,  the first witness he had was Michael Cohen to talk about irregularities  in the 2016 election that he saw from the Trump campaign and things  like that. We had those committee hearings, and we have had a lot of  those committee hearings.  Here we are today, several weeks after the Presidential election.  Regardless of your opinion of the election, regardless of your opinion  of the rightful winner, regardless of your opinion of whether there  were major irregularities or not, there are a lot of Americans who have  a lot of questions about the election process.  There were a lot of things in this election that were unique, not  just the absentee voting process where the rules were changed in the  middle of the game, but also the number of people who voted by mail and  voted absentee. [["", Page , H6888, ]  I feel like the American people deserve one committee in this Chamber  to step up and hold a hearing and hear both sides. If I were Chairwoman  Maloney or Jamie Raskin or Gerry Connolly or Mr. Clay, or anybody on  the committee who hears this request, if I believed there weren't any  irregularities, I would want to have a hearing to make the Republicans  look bad. I am disappointed that we are not doing our job in the  Committee on Oversight and Reform.  But with the specific investigation that Republicans have done in  California, without any help from the Democrats--we don't need their  help. We don't need their help on this. We have already proven it. The  comptroller in California knows it. We are now asking to send the money  back.  If you are not going to explain, Secretary Padilla, if you don't want  to talk about it, that is fine. Send the money back, and taxpayers will  move on.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
100,Michael Conaway,0.2689608931541443,R,conaway,conaway," Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Colorado (Mr.  Lamborn) for those overly kind words, and I certainly appreciate his  sentiments for my service. And I, too, will miss our Armed Services  Committee hearings and sitting beside him. He is a terrific God-fearing  man, and I am better for having known him in that regard.  Mr. Speaker, I was blessed to be raised in a God-fearing Christian  family. Not everybody gets that blessing, but I did. I have never not  known about the Bible or Christ or God throughout my entire life.  My mother believed in being at church every single Sunday morning,  regardless of the consequences or whatever else was going on.  At the age of nine, I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal savior.  And you can become a Christian with knowing a limited amount of the  Bible, but I don't believe you can lead a good Christian life without  studying the Bible, without understanding God's truths that are  contained therein and the instruction that that gives us as to how to  conduct our lives.  Mr. Speaker, Second Timothy 3:16 has already been quoted, but I will  quote it again. It says:  All Scripture is breathed out by God, the Word of God, and   profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for   training in righteousness, that the man of God may be   competent, equipped for every good work.  Mr. Speaker, this Nation is at a crossroads, and we are a divided  Nation across a lot of lines, the partisan divides we fight in this  House day in and day out. There are other moral lines of which our  Nation is divided across. The Bible is important because it is that one  place where the truths never change.  Customs come and go, ideologies come and go, but the truths of God  don't. So if we are to heed the instructions of our Founding Fathers,  that John Adams said, as was mentioned, that are a moral and religious  people, then we need a guidebook. We need an understanding of what  those morals are based upon. If the morals are based upon what I think  are correct or you think are correct, then that is a pretty flimsy  stance to take. We need a foundational truth that is there regardless  of who is Speaker, regardless of who is President. God is always on  that throne, and so, the Bible is obviously important for that regard.  Mr. Speaker, there is a verse in Second Chronicles that I think  contains both a promise for our Nation and a solution for our Nation.  The backdrop on that was that the Nation of Israel, God's chosen  people, if you read through the Old Testament, they had a running  narrative of where their hearts would be good, right with God, things  would be going well, and then within a generation or two they would  fall off, their hearts would get wrong with God, they would be doing  things that would offend God and their mighty ways, and God would use  awful, horrible things to reset that narrative, reset the Nation of  Israel's hearts, so that they could, in fact, be his chosen people.  That tool is still in God's toolbox. I believe the United States is a  Nation of God's chosen people. If you look at what our Nation has done  over the last 100 years, I would argue that no Nation on Earth has ever  done as much good as we have done for the rest of the world and asks so  little in return as this Nation.  Mr. Speaker, I believe that is God's divine mission for us as a  people. But do we continue to be worthy of that mission?  And I would argue that as God looks at this unblessable thing that is  going [["", Page , H7101, ] on in our Nation that we may be rapidly becoming unworthy of that  mission. And if we lay that mantle down, if it is taken away from us,  Mr. Speaker, who will pick it up?  Russia, China, radical Islam?  I don't believe so.  I believe it is important not only for America to continue to be that  God-fearing Nation but also important for the rest of the world.  That verse in Second Chronicles 7:14 says:  If my people, who are called by my name love themselves,   turn from their wicked ways, seek my face and pray, then I   will hear them in Heaven. I will forgive their sins, and I   will heal their land.  Our land needs healing. That is God's promise. It is written in  stone. God doesn't change any of his promises. And that promise is  available to us as a Nation. That is the promise.  The solution, however, lies with us. We must be that people who will  turn from our wicked ways, seek God's face, pray, and then he will hear  us from Heaven, he will heal our land, and forgive our sins.  Mr. Speaker, our land needs healing, probably more so than at any  time since the Civil War. We are a divided Nation, and only God's  guidance and God's divine intervention, I believe, can make that  happen. We have to be, however, God's instruments to make that happen.

101,Gerald Connolly,2.925051689147949,D,connolly,connolly," Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I would just simply close by reminding  everybody that bad planning exacerbated greatly the severity and  duration of this pandemic. And if we have learned anything, we have  learned that we need to plan, we need to have a plan, and that is  certainly true with our Federal agencies.  I believe this bill is a commonsense bill that will add to our  capability to respond quickly in the event of a resurgence of the  coronavirus, and I urge its passage.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Heck). The question is on the motion  offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) that the House  suspend the rules and pass the bill, ', H.R. 7496, ', as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "

Madam Speaker, due to COVID-19 concerns, I was not able to  be present on the House Floor to vote on Senate Amendment to ', H.R. 266, ""-- the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act.

103,Jim Cooper,0.03976054489612579,D,cooper,cooper," Ms. COOPER. Russia.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Russia was not only emboldened on the  battlefield. Ambassador Taylor testified that President Trump's corrupt  withholding of military assistance and his failure to host President  Zelensky in the Oval Office was a ``sign of weakness'' to Moscow. It  harmed Ukraine's negotiating position, even as recently as December 9  when Zelensky and Putin met to discuss the conflict in the east shown  in this photo.  Ambassador Taylor explained:  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  The CHAIRMAN. I think you also testified that Russia was   watching closely to gauge the level of American support for   the Ukrainian government. Why is that significant?  Ambassador TAYLOR. This is significant, Mr. Chairman,   because the Ukrainians, in particular under this new   administration, are eager to end this war, and they were   eager to end it in a way that the Russians leave their   territory. These negotiations, like all negotiations, are   difficult. Ukrainians would like to be able to negotiate from   a position of strength or at least more strength than they   now have. Part of that strength, part of the ability of the   Ukrainians to negotiate against the Russians with the   Russians for an end to the war in Donbas, depends on United   States and other international support. If we withdraw or   suspend or threaten to withdraw our security assistance,   that's a message to the Ukrainians, but it's at least as   important, as your question indicates, Mr. Chairman, to the   Russians, who are looking for any sign of [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S540"">Page S540</a>, ]  weakness or any sign that we are withdrawing our support for   Ukraine.  The CHAIRMAN. And so, when the Ukrainians learned of the   suspension of the military aid, either privately or when   others learned publicly, the Russians would be learning also,   and they would take that as a lack of robust U.S. support for   Ukraine. Is that right?  Ambassador TAYLOR. That's correct, sir.  The CHAIRMAN. And that would weaken Ukraine in negotiating   an end to the war in Donbas.  Ambassador TAYLOR. It would.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Indeed, the aid doesn't just supply much needed  weapons to Ukraine. It is a symbol of support, a signal of strength, a  signal of the backing of the United States. Withholding that aid, even  for a period of time, undermined all of those things.  President Trump's actions toward Ukraine also undercut worldwide  confidence in the United States as a reliable security partner.  Maintaining that confidence is crucial to the strength of our alliances  in Europe to deterring Russia and ultimately protecting and projecting  democracy around the world.  The United States has roughly 68,000 troops stationed in Europe. They  serve alongside troops from 28 other countries that comprise the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO. They are holding the line  against further Russian aggression. It was U.S. leadership that led to  the creation of NATO 70 years ago as the Iron Curtain was descending  across the heart of Europe, and it is American leadership that makes  NATO work today.  NATO is also affected because other countries, friends and foes  alike, know that we are committed to our collective defense; that an  attack against one nation is an attack against all of us. That  principle deterred a Russian invasion of Europe during the Cold War. It  has only been invoked once by NATO in the aftermath of the September 11  terrorist attacks. New York is a long way from the frontlines with  Russia, but our European allies stood with us after that dark day.  They deployed tens of thousands of troops to Afghanistan and joined  us in fighting the al-Qaida terrorists who attacked the Twin Towers and  the Pentagon.  Now, Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but Russia's invasion of  Ukraine was a threat to the peace and security of Europe. Moscow's  aggression threatened the rules of the road that have kept the peace in  Europe since World War II, the sacrosanct idea that borders cannot be  changed by military force.  If we had not supported Ukraine in 2014, if Members of this body had  not voted overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis for military assistance  to rebuild Ukraine's military, there is no question it would have  invited further Russian adventurism in Ukraine and perhaps elsewhere in  the heart of Europe. It would have weakened our allies and exposed U.S.  troops stationed in Europe to greater danger.  Deterring Russia requires persistence--not just one military aid  package or one Oval Office meeting but a sustained policy of support  for our partners. We only deter Russia by consistently demonstrating  support for our friends--friends like Ukraine.  George Shultz, who served as Ronald Reagan's Secretary of State,  understood this. He compared diplomacy and alliance management to  gardening. He said:  If you plant a garden and go away for six months, what have   you got when you come back? Weeds. Diplomacy is kind of like   that. You go around, talk to people, you develop a   relationship of trust and confidence, and then if something   comes up, you have that base to work from.  President Trump's decision to transform the military aid and Oval  Office meeting into leverage was the equivalent of trampling all over  George Shultz's garden, crushing Ukraine's confidence in the United  States as a partner. He also caused our NATO allies to question whether  we would stand with them against Russia. Leaders in European capitals  now wonder whether personal political favors and not treaty obligations  guide our foreign policy.  Colleagues, this is how alliances wither and die and how Russia wins.  Ambassador Taylor made clear that is why it is so important to our  security that we stand with Ukraine.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Chairman, as my colleague, Deputy   Assistant Secretary George Kent, described, we have a   national security policy, a national defense policy that   identifies Russia and China as adversaries. The Russians are   violating all of the rules, treaties, understandings that   they committed to that actually kept the peace in Europe for   nearly 70 years. Until they invaded Ukraine in 2014, they had   abided by sovereignty of nations, of inviolability of   borders. That rule of law, that order that kept the peace in   Europe and allowed for prosperity as well as peace in Europe   was violated by the Russians. And if we don't push back on   that, on those violations, then that will continue. And that,   Mr. Chairman, affects us. It affects the world that we live   in, that our children will grow up in, and our grandchildren.   This affects the kind of world that we want to see abroad. So   that affects our national interest very directly. Ukraine is   on the front line of that conflict.  We understood that in 2017, the first year of the Trump  administration, and it appeared the Trump administration understood it  as well. We understood it in 2018, and the Trump administration  understood that as well. We understood that in 2019, and the Trump  administration appeared to as well--at least it did until it didn't. It  did until something of greater importance and significance came along.  That event of greater significance to the Oval Office was the emergence  of Joe Biden as a candidate for President, and then that military  support, which had increased during the Trump administration, was  suddenly put on hold for inexplicable reasons.  Ukraine got the message. It wasn't very inexplicable to Ukraine. What  is more, Russia got the message. It wasn't very inexplicable to Russia,  which had pushed out the whole propaganda theory that it was Ukraine  that had interfered in our election and not Russia.  So that consensus among the Congress and the administration, among  the right and the left and the center, that, as Ambassador Taylor  explained, this is not only vital to Ukraine's security and the post- World War II order that has kept the peace in Europe for 70 years, but  it is vital to us and our security as well, that all broke down. That  all broke down over an effort led by the President and his agent Rudy  Giuliani and his agents Parnas and Fruman to overturn all of that-- overturn a decades-long commitment to standing up to Russian  aggression.  We have so tremendously benefited. No country has benefited more from  the international rules of the road, the international order, than the  United States. It gave us the peace and stability to prosper like no  other nation has before, and we are throwing it away. We are throwing  it away. We are undermining the rule of law. We are undermining the  principle that you don't invade your neighbor. We are undermining the  key to our own success. And for what? For help with a political  campaign. To quote Bill Taylor, that is crazy. That is crazy.  If our allies can't trust us to stand behind them in a time of need,  we will soon not have a single ally left. I know it is painful to see  some of our allies and how they talk about this President because when  they talk about this President, they are also talking about the United  States. It is painful to see our allies distance themselves from the  United States. It is more than painful; it is dangerous. It is  dangerous to us. I think it was Churchill who once said there is  nothing worse than allies except having no allies.  If we are going to condition our support for our allies on their  willingness to be dragged kicking and screaming into our politics, if  we are going to condition the strength of our alliance on whether they  will help us cheat in an election, we are not going to have a single  ally left, and not a single one of us in this Chamber is ever going to  be able to say to one of our counterparts to respect the rule of law  without it being thrown in our face.  Promoting the rule of law and fighting corruption is central to our  foreign policy. It distinguishes U.S. global leadership from the  transactional approach favored by authoritarian adversaries.  The inherently corrupt nature of the President's demand that Ukraine  investigate his political opponent undermined the credibility of  efforts to promote the rule of law and combat corruption in Ukraine and  around the world. Indeed, the President engaging in the very conduct at  home that our policy fights abroad sabotages longstanding bipartisan  pillars of American diplomacy. [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S541"">Page S541</a>, ]  This was a problem, not least because the pervasive corruption within  Ukraine leaves its politics and economy susceptible to Russian  influence and subterfuge.  Ambassador Yovanovitch emphasized that U.S. policy in Ukraine has  long recognized that the struggle against corruption and defending  against Russia are, in fact, two sides of the very same coin.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. Corruption makes Ukraine's leaders   ever vulnerable to Russia, and Ukraine people understand   that. That's why they launched the Revolution of Dignity in   2014, demanding to be a part of Europe, demanding   transformation of the system, demanding to live under the   rule of law.  Ukrainians wanted the law to apply equally to all people,   whether the individual in question is the President or any   other citizen. It was a question of fairness, of dignity.  Here, again, there is a coincidence of interests. Corrupt   leaders are inherently less trustworthy while an honest and   accountable Ukrainian leadership makes a U.S.-Ukrainian   partnership more reliable and more valuable to the United   States.  A level playing field in this strategically located   country, bordering four NATO allies, creates an environment   in which U.S. business can more easily trade, invest, and   profit.  Corruption is also a security issue, because corrupt   officials are vulnerable to Moscow.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. During that conversation that we related in the  past, when Ambassador Volker urged his Ukrainian counterpart, Andriy  Yermak, not to investigate the past President of Ukraine and Yermak  threw it back in his face--you remember the conversation: Oh, you mean  like the investigation you want us to do of the Clintons and the  Bidens. They taught us something in that conversation. They taught us  that we had forgotten, for that moment, our own values.  Just listening to the Ambassador right now, I was thinking how  interesting it is that Ukrainians chose to describe their revolution as  a Revolution of Dignity. Maybe that is what we need here--a revolution  of dignity at home, a revolution of civility here at home. Maybe we can  learn a lot more from our Ukrainian ally.  In short, it is in America's national security interest to help  Ukraine transform into a country where the rule of law governs and  corruption is held in check.  As we heard yesterday, anti-corruption policy was a central part of  the talking points provided to President Trump before his phone calls  with President Zelensky on April 21 and July 25. President Trump, of  course, didn't mention corruption, but, importantly, those same foreign  policy goals remained intact following the call, as Tim Morrison  testified. Anti-corruption reforms--institutional reforms--remain a top  priority to help Ukraine fight corruption.  President Zelensky was swept into office on an anti-corruption  platform. Immediately, he kept his promise and introduced numerous  bills in Ukraine's Parliament. In a sign that he intended to hold  himself accountable, Zelensky even introduced a draft law on  Presidential impeachment. He also introduced a bill to restore  punishment of top officials found guilty of ``illicit enrichment.''  President Trump's self-serving scheme threatened to undermine  Zelensky's anti-corruption work. Zelensky's successful anti-corruption  reforms would have advanced U.S. security. Instead, President Trump's  demands undermined that effort to bring about reform to Ukraine.  Here is George Kent, a rule of law and corruption expert at the State  Department.

104,Jim Cooper,0.03976054489612579,D,cooper,cooper," Mr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I am pleased to support the fiscal year 2021 National Defense  Authorization Act. Thankfully, maintaining a tradition of  bipartisanship to get the 60th, a record, National Defense  Authorization Act through the House and then through conference with  the Senate is no small feat, particularly during a global pandemic.  I thank, in particular, our outstanding Chairman Smith and Ranking  Member Thornberry for their leadership, as well as Ranking Member Mike  Turner for his partnership in the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, and  all of the conferees for getting to this point.  In particular, I would like to thank Ranking Member Thornberry for  his extraordinary leadership on the HASC over the last 6 years, and I  am happy to congratulate my friend and colleague, Mike Rogers, as the  next HASC ranking member.  The Strategic Forces provisions in the bill would not have been in  place without the outstanding staff work of Leonor Tomero, Maria  Vastola, and Grant Schneider as the lead staffers.  These provisions support our nuclear forces and nuclear  nonproliferation. They also enhance oversight of the warhead  acquisition and plutonium pit production programs, which continue to be  major undertakings. [["", Page , H6924, ]  The conference report supports regional missile defense efforts,  restores funding to critical radar discrimination capabilities, and  provides needed oversight on the next generation of interceptors in  order to ensure fly-before-you-buy principles in this $10 billion  program.  The report acknowledges the increased focus on development and  delivery of conventional hypersonic weapons, while also initiating  efforts to address broad policy concerns regarding the risk of  miscalculation as these new strategic-level weapons are fielded.  With regard to the rapidly transforming space domain, the conference  report supports innovative commercial capabilities, competition, and  the emergence of small-launch providers to provide national security as  well as the codification of the Space Development Agency's mission.  Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong vote in favor of this conference report.    "
105,Lou Correa,1.2189539670944214,D,correa,correa," Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for leading. I thank  Chairman Nadler for his leadership in this issue and thank him, also,  for including my amendment that calls for a study of cannabis as an  alternative medicine for our veterans.  More than half of all Americans live in a State where cannabis is  legal. Let's align Federal cannabis laws with the will of the people.  And let's take full advantage of the medical benefits of cannabis. We  know that medical cannabis is good for treating things such as  seizures, glaucoma, chronic pain, and PTSD, and veterans prefer  cannabis over opioids.  Let me repeat. Veterans prefer cannabis over opioids to treat the  invisible wounds that they bring back from the battlefield.  Other nations, like Israel, export cannabis products. Let's unleash  America's free enterprise system to take full advantage of the  commercial benefits of cannabis.  Let's get busy and do the will of the people. Let's pass the MORE  Act.

106,Jim Costa,0.05964081361889839,D,costa,costa," Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, I  recognize a Latino leader who has been an inspiration and a role model  to thousands of students in my home of Fresno, the San Joaquin Valley,  and that is Dr. Joe Castro, president of Fresno State University, home  of the Bulldogs.  Yesterday, Dr. Castro was named the newest chancellor of California  State University system after spending 8 years at my alma mater at  Fresno State with great success. He is the first native of California  and the first person of color to head the California University system,  the largest in the entire Nation.  Raised in an immigrant household in Hanford, California, he is the  first in his family, like so many, to graduate from college. His story  is the story of the American immigrant.  He serves as a mentor and an inspiration to thousands of first- generation college students who have followed in his footsteps, folks  like members of my family. His leadership led to many accolades for  Fresno State in recent years as the university continues to be one of  the best colleges in the country.  A passionate and fierce advocate for students, his selection to lead  the largest public university system in the country is a testament to  his leadership and the respect he has throughout the Nation as one of  the leaders in higher education. He will leave behind a legacy that was  best expressed when he first came to Fresno State and he told the  student body: ``Be bold.'' ``Be bold.''  Congratulations, Joe and Mary, a real team, a Bulldog team, and  always Bulldog proud.    "
107,Joe Courtney,2.6632678508758545,D,courtney,courtney," Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill and salute  Mr. Takano and Mr. Roe for their fine work.  In particular, I want to foot stomp section 2011, which instructs GAO  to conduct an independent analysis of the VA's 1-year manifestation  rule, which has unfairly blocked benefits for three debilitating  conditions caused by Agent Orange dioxin used in the Vietnam war.  In a nutshell, veterans are required to show these illnesses  manifested themselves within 1 year of exposure in order to get VA  help. Only one problem: 50 years ago, when servicemembers were handling  this poison, the U.S. Government never disclosed how dangerous it was.  When its toxicity was finally recognized decades later, the 1-year  clock to prove manifestation had long expired. It is the ultimate  catch-22.  Section 2011 would not exist but for the tireless work of Vietnam  veteran Gerry Wright from Andover, Connecticut, who has crisscrossed  America rounding up support for abolishing this rule--no lobbyists, no  super-PACs, just old-fashioned citizen activism.  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Gerry. He is a true patriot.  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill.  Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    "
108,TJ Cox,0.7862836718559265,D,cox,cox," Mr. COX of California. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the individuals,  families, and communities of California's 21st District, I want to  express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of being here today.  I am the son of immigrants who, I am sure, never imagined that their  son would become a Member of Congress.  Like my late father, I first started in chemical engineering, but my  career diverged when my wife, Kathy, and I moved to the Central Valley  some 20 years ago in order for her to start and pursue her medical  career, taking care of some of the most critically ill children in one  of the most deserving regions in America.  Mr. Speaker, the best thing I can say about myself is I am married to  her, Kathy Murphy.  For me, I began volunteering with Habitat for Humanity, and from  there, I can directly trace my path to where I stand before you today  as a Member of Congress, as a public servant. It is has been an honor  and a privilege to serve.  There is nothing more rewarding in life than serving others. As the  late Martin Luther King, Jr. said and professed: ``Life's most  persistent and urgent question is: `What are you doing for others?'''  One of my favorite family stories was about my grandmother, my lola,  in the Philippines, right after World War II, in Manila. She saw that  there was a segment of our troops who were being discriminated against.  They didn't have anyplace to go when they got off duty, no place to  hang out and have a drink or a meal or just hang out with their  buddies. So my grandmother, she took it upon herself to open the first  and only social club for African-American troops there in Manila.  Now, my grandmother didn't know or even ever speak to or meet our  friend the late John Lewis, but they were cut from the same cloth. They  lived by the belief that, if you see something that is not right, not  fair, not just, you have to speak up; you have to say something; you  have to do something. My grandmother did something.  That sense of social justice was passed along to my mom, Perla  deCastro, my children's lola, who became one of the State of Nevada's  first equal opportunity officers.  I am so proud of my children, Molly, Joe, Thomas, and Jack, who are  considering serving others in the Peace Corps, the Foreign Service, and  the Armed Forces. [["", Page , H7056, ]  For 2 years, I have been so grateful and so proud of my staff here in  Washington, D.C., and back home in California. They made a positive  difference in the lives of all the people of the 21st District. From  the 27 bills we passed, to the $700 million of water infrastructure  that we got passed through the House, to the over $3.5 million that we  got returned back to over 300 constituents, they were known to be  productive, effective, and capable.  Thank you to my team. You are a shining example of the adage, to be  successful, surround yourself by people who are smarter than you.  I want to thank all the House staff for making this place work, the  Capitol Police for keeping us safe, the ladies in the cloakroom who  kept us fed, the staff at the gym who kept us in shape; and to our  leaders--Steny, Nancy, Jim, and Hakeem--our Caucus is in good hands.  Thank you to all the interns who served in both my D.C. and district  offices. I am proud that you are considering a life and a career in  public service.  I am invigorated by the young men and women who want to make a  positive difference. They are making it happen, being the change they  want to see in their own communities.  My proudest moment as a Member of Congress was that day that we  passed ', H.R. 6, "", the Dream and Promise Act. A young woman from the  Central Valley who came out to witness the passage of that act said to  me afterwards: Thank you, Congressman Cox. You finally make me feel as  if somebody cares.  Beyond the legislation we worked on, my measure of success was to  provide an example that, if you care, advocate and work on the issues  that matter to you, your voice will be heard here in Washington. I do  care, and I look forward to continuing to fight to make a positive  difference in the lives of all Central Valley residents.  And we have to fight, Mr. Speaker. Democracies aren't taken away;  they are given away. I am proud of the role I have played to save our  democracy: first, in 2018, by taking back control of the House, and  this year, in helping win the White House. It brings a smile to my face  to be able to say President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect  Harris.  But there is a lot more work to do to ensure our democracy. Let's all  recall our pledge to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United  States from all enemies, foreign and domestic.  Let us recall that the Framers of the Constitution established  Congress first. We are Article I, supreme amongst the three branches of  the government. The power of the people resides in the Congress, not  the White House.  As this will be my final speech for the 116th Congress, I want to  say, unequivocally, I am proud to be a Democrat.  Now, sometimes our party is not great at messaging. We try to make  every voice heard, and sometimes we pay a price for that at the ballot  box. But here are a few truths that I am happy to sing from the  rooftops:  The Democratic Party has always been the party of working people and  their families.  The fact is, there is only one party that has consistently fought to  win healthcare for your family.  There is only party that will suffer the political consequences of  telling America the truth about COVID.  We are the party of purpose. I was proud to run and serve under our  banner.  I look forward to the Biden-Harris Democratic House and Democratic  Senate. We will get back to work fighting for the people.    "
109,Angie Craig,1.5162893533706665,D,craig,craig," Mrs. CRAIG. Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    "
110,Angie Craig,1.5162893533706665,D,craig,craig," Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of "", S. 3418, "",  the Safeguarding Tomorrow through Ongoing Risk Mitigation Act or the  STORM Act, as amended.  I want to thank Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman  Peter DeFazio, Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings,  and Emergency Management Chair Dina Titus and Ranking Members Sam  Graves and John Katko for their work on this bill to get us to where we  are today.  I also want to thank fellow T&I Member Rodney Davis for being a  strong partner with me on this from the outset. I am also grateful to  Majority Leader Hoyer for scheduling a vote on this bill.  Finally, I also want to thank the diligent members of the Committee's  staff, particularly Aaron Davis, for helping us reach this historic  milestone. I also want to thank a former member of my staff, Natalie  Martinez, for helping to lead the introduction of this bill and my  Legislative Director Will Mitchell for helping to bring the bill across  the finish line.  Madam Speaker, by way of background, the original version of the  STORM Act was introduced last July as "", H.R.3779, "", the Resilience  Revolving Loan Fund Act of 2019 following a catastrophic spring where  Minnesota experienced one of the most devastating flood seasons on  record.  In response, I worked closely with local mayors in Minnesota dealing  with the aftermath of this flooding to develop the concept of a  resilience fund and establish a low-interest loan program for states to  fund pre-disaster mitigation projects which greatly reduce the risks  and costs of natural disasters. Revolving fund loans will be available  for projects that minimize the risks of wildfires, earthquakes, floods,  storm surges, tornadoes, and other events deemed catastrophic by FEMA.  The revolving fund concept is modeled after similar state revolving  funds authorized and funded by Congress for projects that have resulted  in a significant increase in the capacity and capabilities of water  infrastructure in communities across the nation.  It is our hope that our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee  will see the wisdom in the revolving fund concept and fully capitalize  this program starting in Fiscal Years 2022 and 2023 so that disaster  mitigation can see that same significant return on investment.  Madam Speaker, another benefit of this bill is that it opens up  mitigation funds to a new set of eligible folks. Currently, most FEMA  hazard mitigation programs restrict Public Assistance mitigation funds  if projects may accrue to the benefit of homeowners and businesses-- which can create challenges, particularly in rural areas of my  Congressional District with lower populations and large areas of  farmland. The revolving loan fund before us today is specifically  intended to reduce risks for homeowners, businesses, nonprofit  organizations and communities.  As a matter of process, Madam Speaker, I'm pleased that our bill,  like the STORM Act, moved through regular order on the Committee and  attracted bipartisan, unanimous support when it passed the House. Since  March of this year when the STORM Act was introduced, staff members on  the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and Senate Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs Committee worked closely together to  iron out technical differences and present a final bill that can be  signed into law by the President.  Throughout the process, we attracted and maintained the support of a  number of groups that partnered together to build the political will  necessary to pass this bill. In particular, I want to thank the  American Council of Engineering Companies, The American Institute of  Architects, American Society of Civil Engineers, American Society of  Landscape Architects, City Parks Alliance, Ecological Restoration  Business Association, Interstate Council on Water Policy, Mississippi  Rivers Cities and Towns Initiative, National Recreation and Park  Association, The Nature Conservancy and U.S. Chamber of Commerce for  their support.  As part of the Mississippi Rivers Cities and Towns Initiative, I want  to give special thanks to Executive Director Colin Wellenkamp and  outgoing Red Wing Mayor Sean Dowse--who were also instrumental in this  effort.  Madam Speaker, in closing, passage of the STORM Act will be an  important step in making our towns and cities more resilient. I'm  thrilled to be leading the bipartisan effort for smart, proactive  investments in disaster-resilient infrastructure.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) that the House  suspend the rules and pass the bill, "", S. 3418, '.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
111,Eric Crawford,0.9789256453514099,R,crawford,crawford," Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up "", H.R. 8265, ' to extend the Paycheck Protection Program to keep millions of  employees [[', Page , H5134, ] on the payroll of America's small businesses.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair understands that the gentlewoman  from Pennsylvania has not yielded for that purpose; therefore, the  unanimous consent request cannot be entertained.    "
112,Daniel Crenshaw,1.256818175315857,R,crenshaw,crenshaw," Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to unequivocally condemn, in  the strongest possible terms, the actions of the Speaker of the House,  Nancy Pelosi.  Just last week, referring to her obstruction of bipartisan targeted  relief bills that we could have voted on on this floor, she said:  ``Don't characterize what we did before as a mistake. . . . That was  not a mistake; it was a decision.'' When asked what had changed, why  she is finally coming to the table on COVID relief, her response was  simple: A new President.  We have known for months that Speaker Pelosi was holding the American  people hostage for political gain. I have said it; my colleagues have  said it.  While Americans suffered under unscientific, foolish lockdowns,  Pelosi withheld relief for political purposes--not policy purposes, but  political purposes.  But we now have a full admission. She said the quiet part out loud.  This was never about what was best for the American people, never  about honest policy disagreement. It was about preventing President  Trump from getting any credit. It was about politics.  Speaker Pelosi made a simple calculation. She bet that, if she could  keep Congress from reaching a deal on COVID relief, that would hurt  President Trump and Republicans and give her more power.  Even when Members of her own party asked her to bring commonsense,  standalone bipartisan relief measures to the House floor that would  easily become law, she refused. She would say over and over again that  nothing is better than something.  She was being honest. She honestly believed that nothing was better  than something.  But better for who? Not for the American people, that is for sure.  She believed that nothing was better than something for her and her  party. It is hard to imagine a more awful and heartless strategy.  What is worse, Speaker Pelosi does all of this while people in her  home State suffer from unscientific, unconstitutional lockdowns that  Democrat leaders in California are forcing upon their citizens.  These lockdowns are not based in science, never have been. Study  after study shows they yield little, if any, benefits, but they impose  extreme costs on the small businesses suffering under them.  Do you know what else? The Democrat leaders making these executive  orders, they know this, too, because they are violating their own  guidelines. The Speaker of the House couldn't even let a pesky little  lockdown get in the way of a haircut appointment, even though those  same lockdowns destroy the lives of her constituents.  We have all seen the heartbreaking video of Angela Marsden, the owner  of the Pineapple Hill Saloon and Grill in Los Angeles. Everyone should  have to watch that testimony, as Democrats shut down her outdoor-- outdoor--dining while a Hollywood studio sets up shop right next door.  She represents millions of Americans suffering who have taken note of  the hypocrisy of these lockdowns, of the double standards as big  businesses can operate freely while small businesses are shamed into  submission and told, wrongly, that they are the ones who must sacrifice  to slow the spread, that the demise of the business they spent their  whole lives building is the price to pay because ``if it just saves one  life.''  But this is unscientific nonsense and we all know it. Study after  study shows outdoor dining is safe, that outbreaks are not occurring  because of our small businesses: our gyms, our restaurants, our salons.  And yet these small businesses are in the crosshairs of the cowardly  politicians across the country.  This madness has to stop. This arbitrary application of executive  orders is deeply, deeply unconstitutional.  Justice Gorsuch recently stated: ``There is no world in which the  Constitution tolerates color-coded executive edicts that reopen liquor  stores and bike shops, but shutter churches, synagogues, and mosques.''  Americans have had enough. It is time to stand up against the  hypocrisy of these so-called leaders deliberately harming the citizens  they claim to represent and to condemn the deeply partisan actions of  the Speaker of this House.    "
113,Charlie Crist,1.2312413454055786,D,crist,crist," Mr. CRIST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life's work  of a very honorable civil servant who has given so much to Pinellas  County and the City of Clearwater over his long, accomplished, and  selfless career.  George Cretekos has devoted his life to public service, over 5  decades of unwavering commitment to his fellow [["", Page , H6913, ] Floridians, exemplified by deep community involvement, civility, and  practical commonsense decisionmaking. George is a Republican and is my  dear friend.  {time} 1045  George got his start working for St. Petersburg Congressman Bill  Cramer. Upon Mr. Cramer's retirement, he began an extraordinary 35-year  run with Representative Cramer's successor, Congressman Bill Young.  George served on his Washington, D.C., staff and was best known  throughout the county as Congressman Young's longtime district  director.  In 2007, he made the jump to elected office himself, joining the  Clearwater City Council. George served on the council for 5 years  before rising to the mayor's office in 2012. At city hall, Mayor  Cretekos governed Clearwater with unfaltering professionalism,  shepherding major initiatives such as the $60-plus million Imagine  Clearwater downtown waterfront restoration project. In addition to his  mayoral role, he served as the president of the Barrier Islands  Government Council and the Pinellas County Mayors' Council.  Throughout his public career, he was first to listen, quick to find  compromise, and, foremost, committed to the well-being of his  constituents.  I have known George for many, many years. He has always gone out of  his way to look out for ways in our community to help out, large and  small. He served on the OneBlood Tampa Bay area board, donating over 60  gallons of blood during his lifetime. He continues to be a volunteer  courier for the National Bone Marrow Donor Program and remains very  involved with the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church in Clearwater,  Florida.  He was awarded numerous accolades for his contributions, notably from  the Salvation Army as well as the Greater Tampa Bay Area Council of the  Boy Scouts of America.  George was an elected official, but he was never afraid to roll up  his sleeves and quietly do the hard work behind the scenes. He has  volunteered to build homes for Habitat for Humanity. He helped with the  Clearwater Jazz Festival. He serves dinners for the needy. He has  worked 12-plus-hour shifts for days on end as a Pinellas County poll  worker.  Mr. Speaker, please join me, once again, in commemorating the career  of Mayor George Cretekos--my fellow Greek, by the way--recognizing his  outstanding service and dedication to our community.  He has served admirably, with humility. His leadership and character  distinguish him as a gold standard for public service. His good works  will be remembered for decades to come.    "
114,Jason Crow,0.5572408437728882,D,crow,crow," Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I grew up knowing what it felt like to  struggle financially, that fear and anxiety of not knowing where your  next rent check would come from, working a shift at Arby's or a 14-hour  day on the construction site and still not making ends meet. That is  why I am voting for this bill.  As imperfect as it is--and there are plenty of things that are not in  this bill that should be--it will provide immediate relief for millions  of families and small businesses that simply can't wait any longer,  including those that are left out of prior rounds of relief.  For example, my district is one of the most diverse districts in the  Nation and home to thousands of refugees and immigrants. That is why I  have been fighting hard to get payments to mixed-status ITIN families  in this bill. We have been successful in doing that.  Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with the Biden  administration to provide more relief in the coming months so that we  can tackle this crisis together.    "
115,Henry Cuellar,1.2490119934082031,D,cuellar,cuellar," Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman DeFazio for his  leadership, his staff for working hard on this particular bill, and the  ranking member and his staff for doing this.  I want to talk about one project that got added, and that is the  Chacon Creek in Laredo, Texas. This is a project that we have been  working on for many years with the city of Laredo. Now, this will  provide the flood control, the work that we need to do, that starts off  from Lake Casa Blanca all the way to the Rio Grande, miles of area that  will provide not only for the environment but also for the quality of  life for Laredo.  I want to thank Chairman DeFazio so much for his great work, and we  appreciate him in Laredo, Texas.    "
116,Elijah Cummings,3.022744655609131,D,cummings,cummings," Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Madam Speaker, some of my colleagues have argued that holding  Secretary Ross and Attorney General Barr in contempt of Congress is  premature. That is simply not true. If anything, it is long overdue.  The Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice have failed  to comply with congressional requests for more than a year. The  Oversight and Reform Committee Democrats first asked for documents from  the Department of Commerce in April of 2018 and from the Department of  Justice May of 2018. Those requests were ignored.  When I became chairman, I renewed those requests. In response, the  administration produced thousands of pages. But most of the documents  were either heavily redacted, already public, or nonresponsive to the  committee's request. So the committee narrowed its request and issued  bipartisan subpoenas to compel production of that narrow group of  documents. That was in April, more than 3 months ago.  I even asked Secretary Ross to meet with me personally. He refused.  And, last month, the committee passed the bipartisan resolution  before us to hold Secretary Ross and Attorney General Barr in contempt  of Congress. Still neither department has provided the documents that  we have asked for.  So I have come to the floor to urge our Members to vote in favor of  this. I do not, again, bring this lightly. This is not theater. This is  about doing our job. This is about protecting the integrity of not only  our census, but of our Congress.  Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to vote for this resolution, and I  yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the  resolution.  The question is on adoption of the resolution.  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    "
117,Joe Cunningham,1.9034206867218018,D,cunningham,cunningham," Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise with honor to address this  Chamber one last time. And I say ``with honor,'' because it has been  truly that to serve the people of South Carolina's First Congressional  District. I want to thank them for that opportunity, particularly  because, by most accounts, I never should have been here in the first  place.  I was reminded of that over the Thanksgiving holiday as I walked on  the beach on Sullivan's Island with my 2-year-old son, Boone. We were  out there searching for a sandcastle that he had built the day before,  but I knew it had been washed away by the tides.  I thought about the slim chances I had of making it here back in  2018. And then my defeat 2 years later. It became apparent that  political victories and losses are as transient and vulnerable as my  son's sandcastle on the beach. Especially in a district like ours, a  Democrat in a ruby red and gerrymandered district that President Trump  carried by 13 points back in 2016, one that had not been served by a  Democrat in my lifetime.  But we made it here by promising something different, by promising to  work with one another, reach across the aisle, listen to those we may  not agree with, and get things done.  Washington, D.C., was rife with partisanship and chaos. However, I  didn't arrive 2 years ago to simply complain; I came to roll up my  sleeves and be part of the solution. Or, as the old adage goes, I did  not come to curse the darkness, but to light a candle.  But it wasn't just about talk; it was about action. We said we would  work across the aisle, and I was ranked the fourth most bipartisan  Member in Congress.  I said I would work with anyone to get things done, and President  Trump signed two of my bills into law.  I promised to protect our beautiful shorelines in South Carolina, and  we passed my bipartisan bill that did exactly that.  We showed that working together can manifest remarkable results, all  of which was made possible by the dedication of my incredible staff and  with the love and support of my family.  Sadly though, here in Washington, D.C., bipartisanship and civility  seem to be the exception and not the rule. In my short tenure, I have  been disappointed with a lot that I have encountered.  I have seen Members consistently put their party ahead of their own  people; embracing conspiracy theories or arguments detached from  reality while knowing better and, sometimes, admitting so privately.  I have seen Members mock the President behind his back and praise him  to his face; loathe him in private and worship him on television.  I have seen them intentionally spread misinformation and lies, flirt  with white supremacists, and pander to the most extreme voices in our  society.  And it has been for one reason and one reason alone: self- preservation; people more interested in protecting themselves and their  party than protecting our country; more interested in keeping their job  than doing their job.  Such reckless and selfish behavior has created a system where most  politicians can't lose and most Americans can't win. And when it is  time to tackle the greatest challenges before us, our leaders cannot  even agree on the problems, let alone the solutions.  Today's elected leaders bear a tremendous responsibility to be the  custodians of our young and fragile democracy. And make no mistake, our  democracy has been battered and bruised, but it is not yet broken. And [["", Page , H7233, ] to save it, we must agree on one basic truth: that the other side is  not the enemy. The enemy is the stubbornness of our own biases.  {time} 1215  The enemy is a political system that seeks to divide us for sport.  Let's fight that and not each other. Our country is facing some serious  issues right now, and our country will be much better served if  Democrats and Republicans can come together.  My grandfather always told me that you can get through about any  problem if you actually sit down with somebody and have a beer  together. I have been trying to work with people since the first day I  got here. I won't ever stop reaching across the aisle or trying to work  with one another or sitting down and having a beer and listening to  each other.  For the betterment of this country, we have to come together. We have  to sit down, listen to each other, and maybe even have a beer.  In the spirit of bipartisanship and cooperation, I raise this glass  to my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans.    "
118,John Curtis,1.2218332290649414,R,curtis,curtis," Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member  Bishop for helping us move this bill along. Special thanks to my  cosponsor, who shares a not-so-unique problem in our districts of  wildfires and fighting those.  Mr. Speaker, I obviously rise in support of the AIR Safety Act, which  will examine risks and effects of drone incursions on wildland  firefighting.  In the last few years, Utah and the rest of the West have been  battling extreme wildfires. Our Federal land managers and State and  local partners need every tool available to them to put these fires  out.  When a wildfire breaks out, the FAA sets up a temporary flight  restriction, or TFR, around the perimeter to allow aerial firefighters  full access to the fire.  Unfortunately, when people ignore these TFRs and fly their drones  around the fire, fire management must ground their own drones and  helicopters until the area is clear. This wastes valuable time and  money, putting structures and, most importantly, lives at risk.  The AIR Safety Act will direct the Forest Service, Bureau of Land  Management, FAA, and State forestry partners to examine these risks and  come up with ways to stop future problems.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    "
119,Sharice Davids,0.6572354435920715,D,davids,davids," Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  service of Mayor Michael Copeland, who passed away on August 19, 2020.  Mayor Copeland was a devoted father and husband. He is survived by  his wife, Maria, and three children, Olivia, Abigail, and Joshua.  As Olathe's longest serving mayor, he was elected in 2001 and held  the office until his passing.  Mayor Copeland leaves behind a legacy that has touched the lives of  many in the Olathe community.  Personally, I will miss Mayor Copeland's counsel. I very much  appreciated each one of our many conversations since I took office. He  was always generous with his time and knowledge, willing and eager to  represent the people of Olathe.  Mr. Speaker, I offer my deepest condolences to Mayor Copeland's  family and friends and to all of those who will miss his kindness and  leadership. This truly is a loss for Kansas and our community.    "
120,Warren Davidson,0.10934149473905563,R,davidson,davidson," Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Arizona.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to support our First Amendment. I want to support  the ability of people to assemble peaceably, but I also want to address  the mobs that we have seen in our streets and, fundamentally, to defend  our police.  What is it that the mob wants? It is hard to answer. There is a  disparate set of views. Some have called them anarchists. They don't  really have anarchy in mind; they just don't agree on which leftwing  ideology they want to support. But they also are obeying their leaders.  They are doing what their leaders have sent them to do.  One of our House colleagues, in June of 2018, said: ``You get out and  you create a crowd. And you push back on them, and you tell them they  are not welcome anymore, anywhere.''  Isn't that exactly what the mob is doing? Little old ladies trying to  have a meal on a sidewalk here in our Nation's Capital have people  shouting at them--mob intimidation.  And it gets much worse, as my colleague, Mrs. Wagner, just  highlighted. Nine police officers shot just in St. Louis alone. We all  saw the horrific attacks in Los Angeles over the weekend--unprovoked,  unjustified, unjustifiable, indefensible, yet people defend them and  are reluctant to condemn them. This is what the mob is doing.  This is not the First Amendment. This is not the right of the people  to assemble peaceably. And our law enforcement protect that right. They  defend freedom. They protect and defend our communities. They do it  heroically with bravery every day and, so often, thanklessly.  We are right to give them thanks. They put their lives in harm's way.  And they call out their colleagues when they can when they break the  trust of their departments.  We do need to reform some laws. We do need to hold some individuals  accountable, but the idea that we can lay at the feet of all police  these charges that are made is abhorrent.  So we need to defend our police. We need to defend our First  Amendment freedoms to assemble peaceably, and we need to reject the  cries of the mobs.    "
121,Warren Davidson,0.10934149473905563,R,davidson,davidson," Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank this body for the opportunity to recognize our alma mater and our  Association of Graduates at the United States Military Academy at West  Point.  As Mr. Shimkus was highlighting, I didn't come the easy way. As a  friend of mine likes to say, sometimes God will bring you the easiest  way you will go.  For me, my journey to West Point started in my high school guidance  counselor's classroom in September of senior year. Most people realize  that is kind of a late start for the path that it takes to go to one of  our Nation's service academies.  And then she asked me what I wanted to do, And I said: Well, I want  to be an Army ranger.  She said: Well, you know, you are pretty smart. You should go to  college. You should consider college, at least.  I said: Well, you know, I thought about going to West Point. Then I  could be in the Army and go to college.  She looked at me like she felt sorry for me. She said: Well, baby,  that is not going to happen.  That wasn't mean; it was realistic. I had not done the work that it  would take to get there.  She walked me through who normally gets in: The salutatorians, the  valedictorians, the people with the high GPAs while being captain of  sports, Eagle Scouts, and what not. I recognized some of my classmates  who had been on that path, and I recognized that that is not the path  that I had been on. No one in my family on my dad's side had gone to  college.  So she told me: You should work on some other plans.  So I did them. I enlisted in the Army. And when I got to the Army,  thankfully, some of Brett Guthrie's classmates, 1987 graduates Larry  Bradley and Terry Finley, were platoon leaders.  Larry Bradley ended up being my platoon leader for a composite  platoon that got training by the 10th Special Forces Group down in Bad  Tolz, Germany. And it was there, during that platoon, that I learned  that the Berlin Wall had come down, that it wasn't part of the  training, it wasn't just a jazzy intro to a speech.  Some noncommissioned officers stepped up and said: Write this day  down. It is going to be one of the most famous days in history, 9  November 1989.  We thought: Bold intro.  But from that, I had a chance to do something unbelievable that was  the culmination not just of graduates of the United States Military  Academy, but the culmination of people who had fought to win that war.  So many of them West Point graduates, like Eisenhower, like Bradley,  like Patton, who helped liberate a people in that continent.  But I got to see the culmination of that as the wall came down not  because Mr. Gorbachev tore it down or Mr. Reagan tore it down, but  because the East German people found out what was on the other side of  it, and they tore their own wall down. And they found out that the  fruits of our ideology had produced shockingly different results than  what their ideology had produced.  {time} 2000  It is shocking today to think that we might relive some of those bad  choices that led to poverty and scarcity on the other side of the wall  while our ideas led to abundance and flourishing, not perfectly, but  far superior.  From there, I went to the prep school, and I met classmates like  Ranger Bill Lynn. His first unit deployment led him to jump into  Panama, and he had a combat jump there. I met classmates at the prep  school who didn't make it to West Point. Indeed, one of my 1995  classmates is currently the commandant of the United States Military  Academy Preparatory School.  It is a great path, but I also met people who had not been in the  Army. I met people who had come there to increase the diversity  objectives of the Military Academy, who needed a little more strength  on their academics or maybe who needed to balance the academics with  the athletics that they were going to be able to participate in. That  was about half the class.  I learned about a special club at West Point shortly after I came  called the Two-Percent Club, and I met my wife. The Two-Percent Club,  for those who don't know, are those who start with a girlfriend and  graduate with the same girlfriend and end up marrying that girl. I am  thankful today that I am married to my Lisa. People would talk about  Lisa this, and Lisa that, but I would always refer to my Lisa, the girl  who chose to marry me.  We experienced cadet life in a different way. We have all these  memories of things like the cadet in the red sash stepping up to the  line, but not on the line or over the line. We remember things like  Beast Barracks in Buckner, Boodlers runs, spinning the spurs. We  remember the honor code and the character that was so prominently  featured there, that, ``A cadet will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor  tolerate those who do.''  We remember how hard it was to live with the consequences for people  who made those bad decisions, who you knew to be good people, who came  to be separated because it was taken very seriously there.  We saw in the cadet parades that we talked about on the parade fields  The Long Gray Line for the ceremonies where they would lay a wreath for  Founders Day at the statue of Colonel Sylvanus Thayer. You would see  men and women in uniform, but you would see senior citizens at the  front of the line.  The oldest graduate would lay the wreath--often in a wheelchair,  feebly mustering every ounce of strength necessary sometimes to move  from that chair to lay that wreath with pride at the statue in front of  the sup's house.  We remember the million-dollar view at Trophy Point, and we remember  the quarter-million-dollar education one nickel at a time as we  studied.  We remember friends and classmates who helped us through the hard  times. We remember the knowledge like duty, honor, country, or  Schofield's Definition of Discipline.  We remember the seriousness with which nearly every one of us took  the opportunity to be prepared, should the case arise that we would  lead our Nation's young men and women in combat, that we would be ready  to face the challenge. Many of my classmates did that.  I served 5 years in great units, the Old Guard, the 101st Airborne  Division, and the 75th Ranger Regiment. I left Active Duty, which  shocked many of my classmates, and I found a great sense of purpose,  that to give a lifetime of service to the Nation didn't always mean in  uniform. But you still look in awe at the sacrifice that so many have  made who continued on in Active Duty, especially those who gave the  last full measure to keep our Nation free and to bring honor to The  Long Gray Line.  Today, as I look at young men and women and have the privilege of  calling them and congratulating them on all of the work that it takes  to do it--generally, the right way--the advanced [["", Page , H2634, ] knowledge and the preparation--the more common way--the disciplined  path that started earlier in life, I am encouraged because there are so  many talented young men and women who still want to put on our Nation's  uniform to make sure that our Nation is made and kept free with an all- volunteer force committed to serve our country.  I look at The Long Gray Line today, a line that is a very tight-knit  alumni organization where friends could be distant for years, even  decades, and, in a moment, connect as if you just finished playing  spades with one another after hours, ditching the late-lights  penalties.  I look forward to those times. I cherish those memories. And I am so  thankful to the West Point Association of Graduates, which has set a  great example of how to bond classmates together to serve the cause and  interest of our great alma mater so that this Long Gray Line may  continue to flourish always.

123,Danny Davis,2.3357255458831787,D,davis,davis," Ms. DAVIS of California. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for  yielding, and I thank Chairman Scott for his leadership on this bill.  This bill is named after the late Congressman Elijah Cummings for his  great work fighting for affordable healthcare and prescription drugs.  He fought for people like a constituent of mine who wrote to me  regarding the absurdly high cost of insulin. He explained in this  letter that his brother had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, which  requires him to take an insulin injection four times a day. My  colleagues are probably familiar with that, people they know. A single  bottle of insulin costs $400. He tells me that some people skip  needles. Others let themselves stay at harmful blood sugar levels so  that they can make their insulin last longer.  Madam Chair, no one should have to suffer this indignity, especially  when in many places around the world, insulin is as low as $8.  With ', H.R. 3, "", Medicare will be able to negotiate drug prices for  seniors and beneficiaries, and our constituents won't be plagued by  such high costs for such a common drug.  {time} 2045  And thanks to this bill, the NIH will have more resources to  encourage more research and more experimentation. The savings can be  used for large projects and for new pilot initiatives to assist the  development of new cures and treatments, and this can really be  groundbreaking for all of us.  I supported this bill in committee because it boosts the economy by  saving both American workers and businesses billions of dollars. We all  know what that can mean.  Madam Chair, I encourage my colleagues to vote for the underlying  legislation.    "

128,Madeleine Dean,1.678347110748291,D,dean,dean," Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear colleague.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of "", H.R. 3884, "", the MORE Act.  Since the war on drugs began, the Nation's prison population  increased from 300,000 to a staggering 2.2 million people behind bars.  In the decade between 2001 and 2010, 8.2 million people were arrested  on marijuana charges. Nearly 90 percent of those arrests were for  simply having marijuana.  Most troubling is the fact that, despite equal use rates, Black  Americans are four times more likely than White Americans to be  arrested for marijuana.  People of color have disproportionately borne the burdens of these  draconian policies, facing longer prison sentences and the lifetime  economic consequences of having a criminal record. Generations of Black  and Hispanic communities have suffered--families ripped apart,  businesses shuddered, educations unfinished. This is neither law nor  order; it is injustice.  Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity here to right our wrongs. The  MORE Act is a sweeping effort for equity to our criminal justice system  by removing marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and requiring  Federal courts to expunge prior convictions. The bill goes a long way  to reduce racial disparities that plague our criminal justice system.  Marijuana reform is long overdue.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for bringing the bill forward.    "

130,Diana DeGette,0.771702229976654,D,degette,degette," Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Heroes Act.  Our country has weathered almost seven months of unrelenting tragedy.  200,000 Americans have died. Millions are out of work and millions  more are struggling to get by. Families and businesses across the  country need our help and they need it now.  As lawmakers, we have a responsibility to ensure we're doing  everything in our power to respond to a crisis of this magnitude. The  bill we have before us today is exactly the type of bold response that  our country desperately needs.  We know that we can't fix our economic crisis without first  addressing our public health crisis. The Heroes Act relies on a  science-based approach to safely reopening our country, which is  essential to ensuring the long-term success of rebuilding our  communities.  Until we have a safe plan for vaccine development and distribution,  Americans will not feel comfortable returning to work, schools,  restaurants, or businesses at pre-pandemic levels.  And until we have a robust national testing and contact tracing  system in place, we cannot begin to fully stem this pandemic.  The Heroes Act commits another $75 billion for testing, tracing and  treatment.  It also commits another $20 billion to procure vaccine testing and  vaccine candidates to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including a bill  I authored that requires the Department of Health and Human Services to  create a plan to distribute and administer vaccines to stop the spread  of COVID-19 once such vaccines are developed and authorized.  We can't just work to prevent the spread of the disease, though. We  must also find creative ways to ensure health care is accessible for  every American who might need it.  No family should have to choose between putting food on the table or  accessing COVID- 19 treatment. It's not just wrong, it's dangerous.  I'm proud to say that our bill will require coverage of items and  services related to the treatment of COVID-19, ensuring all Americans  can seek treatment for COVID-19 without concern for how they're going  to pay for it.  It will also provide a 12 month ban on evictions and foreclosures  alongside $50 billion in emergency rental assistance and $21 billion in  emergency homeowner assistance. On top of everything else they are  going through, Americans do not need to worry about being thrown out of  their home.  Additionally, the legislation includes my bill to make state and  local governments eligible for paid leave payroll tax credits for  workers affected by the coronavirus. Without these tax credits, the  costs of providing paid leave could undermine successful local  coronavirus responses at a time when budgets are already strained due  to reduced tax revenues caused by the economic fallout of the pandemic.  Tens of millions of families and small businesses are becoming  increasingly desperate amid the ongoing pandemic. House Democrats have  been advocating for more money to be put directly into the pockets of  these workers and families for months. The Heroes Act would provide a  second round of direct payments to families, new payroll protection  measures, and extended unemployment payments.  We cannot sit and wait for a solution--we must take bold legislative  steps to protect our communities, and to prevent any more tragedy and  loss.  The answer is clear: we have before us a bill that will help  struggling families. A bill that will reinvigorate our economy, and  take concrete steps to limit the spread of the virus.  This is the second time that we've had to vote to approve a version  of the Heroes Act. The American people are depending on us. Let's do  what we were elected to do, and pass it on behalf of all of them.    "
131,Rosa DeLauro,2.2949182987213135,D,delauro,delauro," Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York, and  I hope to fill her shoes in what she has done to promote the welfare of  the lives of the people of this country. Thank you.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this bill.  We are at a critical moment. We are not just living through a public  health crisis, but an economic one; two crises, which have magnified  existing inequalities.  Tens of millions of workers are unemployed. Millions of families are  facing hunger, many for the first time in their lives. Small businesses  are going under, and over 300,000 Americans have lost their lives.  The COVID relief package that we are voting on today is a start, and  I thank my colleagues in the House of Representatives for elevating it  to provide important relief.  It brings back the enhanced Federal unemployment insurance, direct  payments, a second round of PPP loans, $13 billion in emergency food  assistance, and a temporary boost to the monthly food stamp program.  And, critically, it includes my Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes  Act.  Despite strong Republican opposition, it provides nearly $2 billion  to maintain the paid leave option. I will fight for paid sick days and  paid family and medical leave in the new year so that no worker is left  behind.  In the Labor-HHS provisions, we were able to secure $155 billion in  life-or-death funding: $73 billion for the Department of Health and  Human Services and $82 billion for the Department of Education.  However, it is only a start, and we must do so much more. We need aid  to cities and States. We need a child tax credit and much more money  for childcare.  Let us act and get the people the help they need.    "
132,Antonio Delgado,1.755562424659729,D,delgado,delgado," Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, Mr. Takano, for  yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of "", H.R. 7105, "". This legislation  incorporates two bills I was proud to introduce.  The first bill is my bipartisan Fairness for Local Veteran Cemeteries  Act, an easy bipartisan fix to allow localities to honor our Nation's  veterans.  As the law is currently written, only State-run veteran cemeteries  are eligible for the National Cemetery Administration's Veterans  Cemetery Grants. This cripples counties and States that don't have  State-operated veteran cemeteries, including New York, Florida, Alaska,  and Oregon, where veteran cemeteries are operated by counties or  county-equivalents.  Our bill will ensure counties and localities can use Federal funds to  help run veteran cemeteries.  "", H.R. 7105, "" also incorporates my Improving Benefits for Underserved  Veterans Act, which would require the VA to publish a report on  veterans' benefits, disaggregating by sex or minority group member  status. This is an important step in leveling the playing field for  women and minority veterans.  The men and women of the armed services dedicate their lives to  defending our Nation and its values. I am proud to support this  legislation that helps our Nation provide better care for our veterans  and protect their final resting place.  Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    "
133,Val Demings,0.8303555846214294,D,demings,demings," Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and  legacy of Mr. Ronald Rogers. Ron dedicated his life to public service  and to creating opportunities for young people.  Ron was a proud member of the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. and a  graduate of Florida A&M University. But above all, he was a proud  graduate of Jones High School, and he loved the students with all of  his heart and soul.  As founder and president of the Orlando chapter of 100 Black Men of  America, he worked hard to mentor students and provide scholarships and  other resources to help them during their college years.  Ron also served in numerous leadership roles, including as city  administrator for the historic town of Eatonville, where his vision for  Eatonville helped pave the way for the town's success today.  Ron never stopped, paused, or exhaled. He had an unwavering sense of  urgency about serving his community, about making his community better.  Ron Rogers truly made a difference in the lives of others, and we are  so grateful for a life well-lived.    "
134,Mark DeSaulnier,0.39573606848716736,D,desaulnier,desaulnier," Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I wish to express my support of the  Water Resources Development Act. This strong, bipartisan bill will help  assure that our nation's ports, harbors, and waterways are developed  and maintained to enhance economic and environmental vitality.  I am particularly pleased with the commitment to beneficial reuse of  dredged material from Corps water resources projects. Dredged material  is a valuable resource that can help restore impacted shorelines and  ecosystems and that can create resilient coastlines and estuaries.  Environmental groups in California have emphasized the importance of  beneficial reuse, specifically because the dredged material can play a  vital role in restoring and preserving shallow water habitats such as  tidal marshes and mudflats. The beneficial use pilot program, first  authorized in WRDA 2016, was so successful that "", H.R. 7575, ' increases the [[', Page , H3962, ] number of eligible projects. Notably, our own San Francisco Bay estuary  faces a number of issues associated with resiliency and sustainability,  and the reuse of dredged material can be enormously helpful in  addressing these critical issues around the Bay. In its report for WRDA  2020, the Committee highlighted Richmond Outer Harbor, Pinole Shoal,  and the San Francisco Bay as priorities for consideration in the next  round of pilot projects.  This year's bill also highlights the role and value of alternative  dredging methods and equipment to beneficial reuse of dredged material.  Specifically, I am encouraged that the Committee clarifies that the use  of alternative dredging methods and equipment must be part of the  overall beneficial use program. This is important as, too often, we  find that the old ways utilized by the Corps for maintaining navigation  channels will not meet modem day demands to protect our natural  resources and build a resilient future through reliable strategic  management plans that allow annual dredging.  This bill will go a long way toward improving our environment,  providing much-needed direction to the Army Corps, and supporting  California's 11th District.    "
135,Mario Diaz-Balart,0.06958094984292984,R,diaz-balart,diaz-balart," Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I  also thank the chair, Mrs. Lowey, for her long career helping working  men and women throughout the Nation.  I thank Chairman Price for working with me on the transportation and  housing title of this bill.  Mr. Speaker, this bill includes $230 million for port infrastructure  programs, which is crucial to coastal States, but also, frankly, to our  entire freight network.  I am particularly pleased that this bill includes $390 million to the  Maritime Academy Training Ship Program.  This bill also renews housing assistance for millions of Americans in  need. It is our duty to meet this commitment, especially for our  elderly; our disabled; and our heroes, our veterans.  I am also very pleased the bill provides $3 billion for homeless  assistance grants.  I have seen the results of those programs firsthand, as we  effectively eliminated homelessness among veterans in Miami-Dade  County.  As a final point on the THUD bill, I would note that this agreement  drops the controversial riders, allowing us to move forward.  This omnibus itself continues strong investments also into our  national defense. It funds Everglades restoration and prioritizes  school safety initiatives.  Once again, Chairman Lowey and Ranking Member Granger led the way  through these very difficult times by working day and night and never  giving up.  A final word to Chairwoman Lowey as she manages her final bill. You  know, you can agree or disagree with this honorable Member from New  York, but she is always honorable, straightforward, a true gentlewoman,  and she has been a huge asset to this institution and to our country.  Godspeed, Madam Chairwoman.    "
136,Debbie Dingell,2.077119827270508,D,dingell,dingell," Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill ("", S. 5076, ') to [[', Page , H9173, ] authorize the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate to delegate  authority to approve payroll and personnel actions, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman  from Michigan?  There was no objection.  The text of the bill is as follows:  ', S. 5076, ""  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of   the United States of America in Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. AUTHORITY TO DELEGATE AUTHORITY TO APPROVE PAYROLL   AND PERSONNEL ACTIONS.  Section 1201 of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1984   (2 U.S.C. 6598) is amended--  (1) by striking ``all vouchers, for payment of moneys,''   and inserting ``any voucher for payment of moneys, payroll   action, or personnel action''; and  (2) by striking ``any voucher, for payment of moneys,'' and   inserting ``any voucher for payment of moneys, payroll   action, or personnel action''.  The bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third  time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
137,Lloyd Doggett,1.233229398727417,D,doggett,doggett," Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, I join today in support of the ALS  Disability Insurance Access Act to ensure that individuals diagnosed  with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) receive the financial support  they need and for which they have already qualified. I congratulate  Congressman Moulton and Senator Whitehouse on their successful  leadership for this important effort of which I have been a cosponsor.  For individuals who are determined to have a sufficiently severe  disability to quality for Social Security Disability Insurance, the  security that Social Security is intended to provide can come with a  cost--two years without health insurance. This waiting period--which  should really be called a suffering period--must be eliminated. Two  unjustified delays prolong the suffering. The first, a five-month delay  to receive any disability payment even though the recipient has already  qualified. The second, is a two-year delay to access Medicare coverage  for which they already qualified.  This means that the millions of individuals with disabilities in this  waiting period may not be able to access necessary medical treatments  and medications. This only makes existing health complications worse  and increases overall health care spending. Many die waiting their turn  for health coverage. In 2018 alone, about 16,000 workers with  disabilities died during the 5-month waiting period and about 56,000  workers with disabilities died waiting for Medicare coverage.  These waiting periods only serve to harm the health of individuals  with disabilities and delay the support they need. In addition to this  bill for individuals with ALS, other colleagues have offered  legislation to end the waiting periods for individuals with metastatic  breast cancer, Huntington's Disease, and other life-threatening  illnesses. I support all of these efforts. We must provide a healthy  foundation for all individuals with disabilities, who already arc  experiencing unique health challenges.  I hope that this ALS bill represents a step forward in the eventual  approval of the bipartisan Stop the Wait bill, "", H.R. 4386, "", that I  introduced to eliminate the onerous waiting periods for Social Security  Disability Insurance and Medicare. This bill now has 50 House  cosponsors. and Senator Bob Casey has introduced companion legislation.  Having recognized the suffering of these waiting periods for Americans  with ALS, I urge Congress to consider the suffering of all those  subject to waiting periods and pass long-overdue reforms to Stop the  Wait. We must ensure individuals with disabilities have access to  health care when they need it. Social Security cannot truly provide  health care security, until all individuals with disabilities have  guaranteed access to prompt Medicare coverage. Let's Stop the Wait for  all of them.    "
138,Sean Duffy,0.24157890677452087,R,duffy,duffy," Mr. DUFFY. Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from Wisconsin for  yielding tonight.  Madam Speaker, I have got to tell you, it is a pretty unique and cool  feeling to stand in this well and hold onto this podium for the last  time. What an honor it is to serve in this House and stand in this  Chamber.  I want to take a moment, as I give my last address to the House, to  thank my constituents who have put so much faith in me that they would  give me the opportunity--a guy from small town Wisconsin, from Hayward,  Wisconsin, who had a big family and grew up doing lumberjack sports--to  come here and represent them. And they have done that five times, five  times over.  I would just note that they have been so kind to me, whether they  agreed with me or not. Whether I was at a townhall or a Lincoln Day  dinner or a dairy breakfast or a parade or affair, the kindness that  has come from my constituents as I have done my best to serve their  interests could not fill my heart with greater pride and joy to  represent the good people of Wisconsin's Seventh Congressional  District, which is the central, northern, and western part of our great  State.  But, as many of us will tell you, I don't think our Founders ever  envisioned that to come to this Chamber should be a lifetime sentence.  We are supposed to come, be citizen legislators, serve our time, and  then step aside and let someone else step forward and do the good work.  And, in news reports, as I have announced that I was going to step  aside, people will say, ``Sean Duffy's seat.'' Well, I think we should  correct that. It is not my seat. It was not my predecessor's seat. It  is the people's seat, and they get to choose every 2 years--well, now,  this is going to be 8 months in--a new Congressman to represent them.  It is the people's seat. It is not mine. It is theirs. So, I thank the  Seventh District.  I want to say thanks to my fellow colleagues and Members of Congress  on both sides of the aisle. We get a bad rap in this Chamber where  people will tell us: You guys are so dysfunctional. You guys can't get  along. You guys can't get anything done.  There is some truth to that. There is a lot of bickering; there is a  lot of fighting; and, yes, sometimes we don't get a lot done. But I  will just tell you this, that people get along a lot better across the  aisle than might meet the eye on some of the major news networks.  Though it might not be on tax reform or immigration reform, there is  a lot of legislation that we work on together, on which we try to find  bipartisan compromise that can not just pass our committees, but can  pass the House and can get our dysfunctional friends in the Senate to  actually pick up and pass so we can get it to the President's desk. It  happens a lot.  The Chamber, I think, though it is going through some difficult  times, we are actually working, and I am proud of that.  I am proud to serve with my ranking member, Patrick McHenry, who has  been so kind and generous to me. I have actually enjoyed serving with  Maxine Waters.  Some of the subcommittee chairs and ranking members like Al Green and  Lacy Clay and Emanuel Cleaver have become good friends of mine, and I  honor their friendship and am grateful for it. But sometimes,  oftentimes, we work better than we are given credit for.  I want to take a second, because I think this is such an important  part of the debate that we are having today, and talk about American  capitalism. I mean, American capitalism is the American model. It has  been our American way that has brought us more opportunity, more  prosperity, more upward mobility, more innovation, more creativity,  more generosity than any other country that has existed on the face of  the Earth.  Part of that American capitalist system is an idea not that we have  no government, but that we have limited government, and not that we  have no taxes, but we have limited taxes. What you saw over 2 years of  a Republican-led majority in the House and the Senate with a Republican  President is we did those things. And the net end result was what we  thought it would be: We put people back to work.  When I ran the first time 9 years ago, we had people who couldn't  find jobs, families who were suffering. I heard, all the time, families  say: I wish we had a better economy, because I want my kids to be able  to stay in our hometown and get a job in our hometown and raise their  family in our hometown so we can have an extended family, but they have  to leave. They have to go to Milwaukee or Minneapolis or Chicago or  Wausau or somewhere else to get a job, but they can't stay here.  {time} 1945  But today, after we have implemented these reforms, it is profound  what is happening. People are going back to work. In Wisconsin, our  wages are up, and unemployment is down. We have more jobs in Wisconsin  than we have people to fill those jobs. That is a success story of  American capitalism. I am proud of that.  Though everybody may not agree that it has been those policies that  have created it--some of those are on the left--when they dig deep in  their heart, they can't deny that what we have done has made their  lives better.  And so often we have, in my district, it has been the forgotten men  and women, men and women who feel like people come to this Chamber, to  this town, and they engage in debates that are irrelevant; debates that  don't make their lives better; debates that don't improve their  economy. Maybe it is a debate that might improve the coasts or global  corporations, but it is a debate that doesn't help their rural, small- town community.  They have seen, over the last few years, that their voices have been  heard; their pain has been heard, and it has been addressed. And for  that, they are incredibly grateful.  When you shop at Walmart and you have a hard time figuring out where  you are going to get the dollars to pay your mortgage, or how you are  going to send your kids to school, and if you lose your job, then it  all collapses; and in today's market, they look and go, This is really  great. This has improved so much. We couldn't be more grateful for the  economy and the system that has offered this prosperity that we now  feel.  I am troubled that, even though we have had the success of a free  enterprise system, an American capitalist system, we now have a debate  in this Chamber where people want to go a different model, right?  We have a debate saying we want to go to socialism. Socialism should  be the model of America's future; and that the promise of socialism,  where we can all be equal, and we can all get free stuff, if we can  just tax the rich a little bit more and give a little bit more to you,  it is going to be a beautiful economy.  Those promises have been made throughout human history, and those  promises always fail. Whether you want to go to the old Soviet Union,  whether you want to go to Venezuela, or Cuba, it never works.  This country actually fought socialism in Europe. We fought socialism  in our universities. Now we are fighting socialism in the halls of  Congress?  We can't lose this fight, because if we lose this fight, we lose our  future. And if you lose the future, you don't leave enough to your  kids.  So I hope that this Chamber will recalibrate and think through what  the best economic model is to continue with that prosperity, continue  with that opportunity for our kids and for our next generation.  But as we talk about maybe equality and opportunity, I do think there  is a really important point: As the socialist talks about the equality  of the outcome, I think our model has been the equality of opportunity. [["", Page , H7830, ]  When I look at communities in America, and communities in Wisconsin,  and you can look at a zip code of that community, and you will be able  to recognize the opportunity and the poverty of the kids that are being  raised in those communities, by their zip code, because of the school  system they have in place in those communities in those zip codes.  That is a travesty. That is not equal opportunity. That has given a  group of kids the short end of the stick.  So, as I have been in this Chamber, I have fought for school choice.  Because if you are a parent and you have a child and you have a failing  school, you should have the opportunity to get out of your failing  school and go to a school that is going to give you the skill sets and  the tools to take advantage of the American economy. You should have  that right. You should have that option. And that is school choice.  I would love it if we could make the schools better in these  communities, and we should fight to do that. But these kids can't wait.  So I hope the fight for school choice continues.  I have fought in this Chamber for free trade, but I have also fought  with our President for fair trade. And when we have people who take  advantage of this economy, of my constituents, and say it is free  trade, well, free trade isn't free trade if it is not fair trade. And I  couldn't support the President more in his fight against China to make  sure that we have a fair system with their growing economy. And it is  not easy.  I look in this Chamber. Oftentimes there is not a lot of political  courage, but you have a President who, one of the greatest things he  has going for him is the great economy; and he is willing to jeopardize  this great economy, to risk the great economy and engage in a trade  conflict with China, not to help him in the next election, but to help  American kids in the next 10, 15, 20 years.  That is what real leaders do. That is what courage is in a leader,  and that is what our President has done on this trade fight; risking  the economy for the kids and our future, to make sure we are still the  number one economy and the number one military.  One of the great issues I am proud to have fought on is the issue of  life. I don't think that there is anyone who is more vulnerable, more  voiceless than the unborn; and to have been in this Chamber, and to  have been able to lend my voice to those who don't have one has been an  amazing honor.  I think that this will be a scourge at this time period in American  history, and we have had these time periods in our past, that we  haven't stood up and fought what science tells us, as you look at a 4D  ultrasound, what that baby is in the womb.  I am on the right side of history to have fought for the millions of  little babies who have lost their lives over the course of the last 40- plus years. And I hope this Chamber one day can see that life does  begin at conception; that we shouldn't be having a debate about late- term, partial-birth abortion. We shouldn't be having a debate about how  we allowed children to die more comfortably after they are born; that  that is outrageous. It is, frankly disgusting. We should get that  right.  As I close my final remarks from this well, I want to thank my team.  Any Member of Congress, anyone who serves in this institution can't  do it without great people with them, great people surrounding them,  fighting--not with them personally, but fighting on the issues with  them. It doesn't work without them.  Over the course of the last 8\\1/2\\ years, I have had the most  remarkable team to serve with me and work with me. And though they have  worked for me, they are some of my best friends who have stood with me,  and I couldn't be more grateful that they have come into my life and  come into my district and our community; and not just fought so hard  with me, but fought so hard for the people that I represent to make  sure their issues are covered, to make sure that their voices were  heard.  They helped me amplify my constituents' voices, and I want to thank  Pete and the D.C. team, specifically, and Jesse and the district team  for their endless efforts. My constituents were well served by them, so  thank you.  Finally, I want to thank my family. When I started, I didn't have as  many kids. Actually, I had Patrick and Margarita and Mari V and Paloma,  who didn't know their father at any point other than as a Congressman.  But some of my older kids were well aware of what we did before.  My oldest daughter, Evita, we did our first parade together, and I  was terrified. I was terrified to do a parade, and this little 9-year  old girl came out with me with the most courage.  All of them have stood with me and worked with me and campaigned with  me. It has been a family endeavor.  Anyone who runs, they know the sacrifice that their families go  through. My family has been great, going to parades, and going--in  Wisconsin we do dairy breakfasts--going to dairy breakfasts. And they  have been there supporting me and working with me, and I couldn't be  more grateful for them.  As their dad comes out to Congress 4 days a week, I am not there as  much, and they have supported me through this whole effort, this whole  adventure. A dad can't do that unless he has kids who support him. So,  to all of them, from Lucia, to Evita, to Patrick, and John Paul, and  Margarita, and Mari V, and Paloma, and Jack, I want to thank you all  for the support you have given me.  Finally, I want to thank my wife, I would not be here without her.  When I ran, everyone said I could never make it to this Chamber. I  could never win. And she was the one who said, No, I think you can. I  think you can represent these people, your people well. And we did it  together.  When I am here, as every spouse who has someone who comes here, she  was the one who held up our house. She was a single mom, and we have 8  kids. She was a single mom with 8 kids. And you have to be incredibly  dedicated and devoted and passionate about what we do in this Chamber  if you are going to be a single mom with 8 kids and let your husband go  off and fight the great fight of the day.  So I want to tell her how much I love her and how grateful I am that  she has supported my dream to come here and fight the good fight.  When I won on my first night, on election night, I said that the  battle for America's future is a fight against socialism. It is a  battle to return our Nation to the principles that made America  different, that made America better, that made America great. I think  that couldn't be more true today.  And with me and Rachel, and my team, and my kids, I couldn't be more  grateful that they have stood with me to help engage in that fight.  So for the final time, as I step out of this well with a grateful,  and it might not be obvious, but a happy heart, I want to thank my  colleagues for their friendship.  I want to thank the great State of Wisconsin for their trust.  I want to thank my whole family for their support. I want to thank  God for his blessings, and for this opportunity and for the wisdom to  know when my time is up.    "
139,Jeff Duncan,0.14512598514556885,R,duncan,duncan," Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the former chairman for  yielding me the time today.  I rise in opposition to ', H.R. 4447, "", the Democrat's so-called energy  package. This bill promotes a radical Green New Deal policy that would  cost Americans more than $135 billion. Meanwhile, the bill provides no  regulatory or permanent reforms.  If Democrats were serious about reducing emissions, they would focus  on getting clean technologies, like nuclear energy, to market quicker.  I offered an amendment last night, but it was rejected by the Rules  Committee which would facilitate efficient environmental reviews for  nuclear reactor licensing. Its goal was to accelerate the deployment of  nuclear reactors which generate zero emissions during electricity  generation, if that is your goal, zero emissions. Unfortunately,  Democrats would rather weaponize our permitting laws for political  motives.  If we eliminate natural gas, or nuclear, in power generation and  transition to 100 percent renewables, which "", H.R. 4447, "" seeks to do, the  cost to national security would be detrimental. The United States would  shift from being an energy-dominant country to being energy dependent  at a cost to energy consumers because lower income Americans in this  deal would pay more as a percentage of their disposable income than  others.  It would be costly to the environment and our own security self- interest. I don't understand why my amendments aren't made part of this  package other than the politics.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on "", H.R. 4447, "".    "
140,Neal Dunn,0.6056286096572876,R,dunn,dunn," Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Roe for putting on this  opportunity for us to address the American people directly and reassure  them that this Operation Warp Speed is truly an amazing accomplishment  for our country.  Mr. Speaker, if you were born after 1969 you didn't get a chance to  celebrate with us on the original moonshot, those heady days of the  Apollo landing and all the run-up science to get that done.  This is America's new moonshot. This is an amazing program. By  leveraging the private sector and all parts of the private sector, as  well as all of the agencies and all of government effort, we are making  progress on medical science at a rate that has literally never been  seen before. Every living Nobel Prize laureate with a Nobel Prize in  medicine is cooperating with the government and rushing forward. The  science on all these areas is really making a difference and making a  difference very quickly.  The administration put $10 billion with a B--bravo--in supplemental  funding into the Operation Warp Speed and separately another $1.5  billion into developing Shark Tank testing. So we are not only working  on vaccines, we are working on testing for the virus, we are working on  prevention of the virus, and we are working on therapeutics, that is  medicines that are true antivirals.  We already have new protocols so that we are improving the treatment.  The mortality rate for this disease has plummeted.  I mentioned that innovative and creative people are coming out and  working on all facets of this disease. I have a story. This is a mask.  Every one of you has a mask. This is a different kind of a mask. This  is made out of a polyester fiber, and it is impregnated with bionic  silver. It is virucidal. It kills the virus. It kills bacteria as well.  So when you take your mask off, Mr. Speaker, and you put it down on the  table, it sets about sterilizing itself. When I pick it back up, it  will be sterile. That is an amazing accomplishment. That happened just  this year, just since this started.  It is amazing these things can happen. All the science and all the  medical experimenters and all the researchers are running flat out. We  are pushing new frontiers in medicine. We are doing things that we  never thought we would do in my lifetime in medicine. We have broken  the mold, and I am so grateful to all the brilliant innovative men and  women who are pushing out these frontiers and helping everybody.  Medicine will never be the same after this just because of the advances  in this time to this threat. We will be treating all of our diseases  differently in the future.  Before I close I would like to associate myself with the comments  Chairman Roe made earlier about the heroism of the medical care people  and the healthcare people at all levels, including the ambulance  drivers and the police who have to go out and respond to people. It is  heroic for them to go out there and do that and continue to work in  very difficult and challenging circumstances. But I think what this  amounts to is America's shining moment in medicine. I can't think of a  better time I have ever seen American medicine respond.  It has been a pleasure working with Chairman Roe.  Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. It has been. One of the things that  the CARES package did was--this is not Operation Warp Speed--but the  CARES package also provided the way we shift when seeing patients in  person through telehealth.  The VA, for instance, about 1 year ago did 70,000 or 80,000  telehealth visits a month for their PTSD treatments. That number went  to over 900,000 in May of this year. That is unbelievable when you can  do that. I think many practices now, including my own at home, have  used telehealth to see patients, and I myself have used telehealth  which saved me a many-hour drive one way or the other.  The pandemic is not all bad. We have learned some good things and  some things I think that are going to persist after we get through this  particular pandemic.  I also might add, this is not the first pandemic we have had. That is  why I know we were going to be fine. There was an H3N2 pandemic in  1968, a coronavirus pandemic, and we got through that as a country. We  have responded so much better this time with the therapeutics,  monoclonal antibodies antivirals, just the way we treat it.  Anticoagulation hasn't been mentioned. We know this is an  inflammatory response. It causes coagulation in the kidneys, the heart,  and the lungs. So we have learned that.  Hats off to our medical professionals who have gone out and  literally--it is unbelievable how fast they have upped their knowledge  of this.  I appreciate the gentleman's comments.  {time} 2100  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce),  who I just introduced. He is double-boarded in internal medicine and  dermatology, is a relatively new representative from Pennsylvania 13th,  and has had 31 years in practice.    "
141,Tom Emmer,0.28022998571395874,R,emmer,emmer," Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Automotive Parts  Headquarters in St. Cloud, Minnesota, on 100 years of dedicated service  to their customers and their community.  Owning and operating a business is never easy, and reaching this  milestone is an important testament to the hardworking people they  employ and the services they offer.  Founded in 1920, Automotive Parts Headquarters outgrew their first  shop in Minneapolis. Today, they have 125 corporate stores and 36  independent locations across the Midwest.  Automotive Parts Headquarters has stayed true to its roots. In fact,  President and CEO Corey Bartlett is the third generation of his family  to be involved in the business.  It was an honor to visit Automotive Parts Headquarters recently and  learn about the great work they do in the St. Cloud area.  Automotive Parts Headquarters not only supplies parts to repair  shops, the company builds partnerships with their customers to help  them grow.  Automotive Parts Headquarters also supports the communities where  they operate, contributing to charities like the American Cancer  Society, Toys for Tots, and WACOSA.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Automotive Parts Headquarters for their  continued service to our communities and congratulate them for 100  years of incredible service in Minnesota.    "
142,Eliot Engel,3.336190700531006,D,engel,engel," Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I would hope that anyone who has ever had  the privilege to serve as a Member of Congress leaves this place with a  heart full of gratitude. After 32 years as a Member of this body, I  certainly feel that way.  It is hard to believe that I have been elected for 16 terms, 32  years. I came here at age 41, not knowing exactly what to expect, and I  have learned a great deal in these 32 years.  I send gratitude, first and foremost, to the people of the 16th  District of New York for sending me here 16 times. It has been an honor  to have your trust and to be your voice here in the House.  Gratitude to thousands of people: the Capitol Police; the Sergeant at  Arms; the Congressional Research Service; the Architect of the Capitol;  the Office of the Attending Physician, Dr. Brian Monahan; and so many  others. It takes [["", Page , H7254, ] a small army to keep Congress running, and you seldom get the  recognition you have earned.  Gratitude to my staff over the years, and let me acknowledge a few  who have been with me for a long while: the staff director on the  Foreign Affairs Committee, Jason Steinbaum; my chief of staff, Bill  Weitz; and my administrative assistant here in Washington, Ned  Michalek.  Madam Speaker, I will include in the Record a full roster of my staff  in the office of the 16th District and on the Committee on Foreign  Affairs, with my profound thanks. And, of course, Madam Speaker, I send  gratitude to my fellow Representatives.  When I came here, I never could have imagined that I would get to be  chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. It is a committee that  I followed for many years. It is a committee that I have always thought  was prestigious. It is a committee that I thought was very important,  and to be on that committee was a wonder for me, but to be the chair of  that committee is just unbelievable.  I especially want to thank the members of the New York delegation,  past and present. We are a group as richly diverse as the great State  we come from. I am proud of the way we have stood together and stood up  for New Yorkers, particularly in times of crisis and tragedy: the  pandemic we are enduring now; Superstorm Sandy; the Great Recession;  and, of course, in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001.  I am grateful to our leadership on both sides, and it has been a  unique honor to serve alongside our distinguished Speaker, Ms. Pelosi  from California. I have served alongside her for the entire length of  my time in the House, and let me tell you--let me tell everybody--she  is certainly one of a kind. I am privileged to call her my friend.  We work very hard here, and sometimes we are so busy working, we  don't get to know some of our fellow Congress Members, particularly  those on the other side of the aisle. As people are coming up to me and  wishing me the best as I leave Congress, it is people from both parties  who are doing it. My Republican colleagues are doing it and my  Democratic colleagues as well, wishing me the best. It has been just an  honor to serve with them.  We have to get to know each other better. I think we have lost some  of that.  If you have a colleague and you don't serve on their committee and  you are not from their State and you are from the opposite political  party, you don't really get to know them. That is a shame, because I  have learned that we have so much talent on both sides of the aisle,  people who are coming up to me and wishing me well, Republicans as well  as Democrats, and that is really the way it should be.  Again, if you don't see somebody in the gym, if you don't travel with  them to some countries on the other side of the globe, if you don't  have much interaction with them, you won't get to know them, and that  is one thing I hope changes, and changes soon.  People have been stopping me here and wishing me well upon my  retirement from Congress, and many, again, are from the other party,  and I want to thank them, because it means a lot to me.  I have tried to be bipartisan, not giving up what I believe and not  pulling back from what I feel, but being bipartisan in that you can  respect each other even if you don't agree on some of the issues.  We are all here trying to do the same thing. We are all here trying  to bring things home to our districts. We are here because we love  America, and we are here because we are here with people who also love  America.  My greatest honor here has been to serve during this Congress as the  chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.  {time} 1715  When I was sworn in for my first term back in 1989, the then-majority  leader, who soon became Speaker, Tom Foley of Washington State, asked  me my top three choices for committee assignments. I had to write it  down, one, two, and three. For one, I wrote foreign affairs. For two, I  wrote foreign affairs. And for three, I wrote foreign affairs.  I did it because I wanted to emphasize the fact that I had hoped to  be on the committee, even though people asked me: Why do you want to be  on foreign affairs?  It is not a committee that is back home. It is not something that you  can meet people on. It is foreign affairs. It is all over the world.  I haven't regretted being a member of the committee and being the  chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for one day. To me, what  is going on in the world, what is going on in the world now, what went  on in the world before, what is going on in the world in the future is  so important, and this Congress needs to be engaged and this Congress  needs to be very much listening to what is going on, and help move this  country to the direction that we all know the United States can do.  I said foreign affairs because, you know, since I was a kid, growing  up in Bronx, New York, in public housing, since that time, I have been  fascinated with America's leadership role in the world.  All four of my grandparents were Jewish immigrants from what is now  Ukraine, who fled the pogroms of the early 20th century, looking for  safe haven and opportunity. And guess what? They found it in America.  They came here before World War I. If they hadn't come here, they  almost certainly would have perished in the Holocaust.  This country has been a refuge to people who are hurting for many,  many years, and I am grateful for it.  As a child of the Cold War, I remember learning about America as a  beacon of freedom and democracy, standing opposed to an oppressive,  totalitarian ideology. My entire life has been an education in what a  force for good America can be when we are at our best, in the American  values that support human rights and human dignity, and America's  character of compassion and generosity.  So, of course, as a public servant, I wanted to leave my mark on the  way the United States conducts itself on the global stage. There are a  few areas where I like to think I made a difference.  I have always had a special place in my heart for the Balkans and, in  particular, a country called Kosovo. There are many Kosovar Albanians  in New York, and that is how I first got to know the community. A good  friend of mine, Harry Bajraktari, is the one who introduced me to the  community, and we have been doing work with the community and with the  country of Kosovo ever since.  I strongly supported the Clinton administration's intervention in the  Balkans in 1999. We stopped genocide from happening again in Europe by  doing that. That was NATO at its best, that was America at its best,  stopping genocide. A million people were being thrown out of Kosovo,  and we stopped it. That was one of my proudest moments as a Member of  Congress.  I remember talking with President Clinton and saying, We have got to  help these people; we have got to help these people.  And we did. We know in hindsight that it stopped a genocide. And  since then, I have been a champion for Kosovo's sovereignty and  independence. That country has made tremendous strides and is  recognized by the United States, the UK, France, Germany, Japan, and so  many other important nations.  The people there are very, very pro-American; and when you go there  as an American, you can't help but feel how much they love this country  and how grateful they are that we helped them with their independence.  I have been honored by that country to have had a highway and a road  named after me. And they even put me on a postage stamp. I was joking  with my wife. I said, You know, it is not a cheap postage stamp they  put me on. It is a 2 pound postage stamp--two euro, I should say, a two  euro postage stamp. What an honor for me.  I served for a time as chairman and ranking member of the Western  Hemisphere, Civilian Security, and Trade Subcommittee, and I have  always pushed for a foreign policy that focuses on prioritizing what is  going on in our own neighborhood.  One of the last bills President Obama signed into law was my bill,  the Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission Act, which required our  government to take stock of what has worked [["", Page , H7255, ] and what has failed in our drug policy over the last few decades. The  commission recently submitted its report to Congress with  recommendations that I hope will improve U.S. drug policy and save  lives.  I have also been a strong advocate for closer ties to our Caribbean  neighbors. I wrote the United States-Caribbean Strategic Engagement Act  to push for a new strategy to engage Caribbean countries that seek out  the expertise of the vibrant Caribbean diaspora living right here in  the United States.  And when the Trump administration cut off assistance to Central  America, I was proud to lead a bipartisan effort to restore those  resources that are helping to reduce crime and violence and root out  corruption.  Thanks to my partner and friend, Michael McCaul of Texas, who was  right there on the trip with me, right by my side fighting with me,  fighting with me for what is right. Michael is a Republican from Texas.  I am a Democrat from New York. We have become really, really good  friends, and I wish there would be more of that in Congress. When you  get to know someone, again, in the other party, and you don't serve on  a committee with them, but then you get to know them, you see how  marvelous they are. We have such good people here from all over the  country doing their best, working hard and representing their districts  well, and Michael is certainly in that league.  So I was proud to lead a bipartisan effort to restore those resources  that are helping to reduce crime and violence and to root out  corruption.  I have also long focused on American policy toward Syria. In 2003, I  wrote the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration  Act, which helped end the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. It pushed the  Syrians out of Lebanon.  In 2012, I sponsored the first bill to arm the Free Syrian Army in  its fight against the Assad regime. And just a year ago, my  legislation, the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, finally became  law, providing the toughest sanctions to date on Assad, who has killed  so many people, and his enablers.  I encourage the incoming Biden administration to take full advantage  of these tools, dial up pressure on the regime, and try to stop the  violence.  I said at the start of my time here, when I spoke to some people back  home, that Israel would not have a better friend in Congress than Eliot  Engel. And no matter where you stand on U.S. policy toward Israel, it  would be tough to argue that I haven't lived up to that commitment. I  have been proud to stand with our ally, Israel, our closest friend in  the Middle East and, I would argue, in the world, throughout my career.  I believe that the United States and Israel share an incredibly  important partnership, and the cornerstone of this relationship is the  support it receives from both sides of the aisle. Congress should  continue to give this partnership its full support in the future. No  one should play partisan politics with America's relationship with  Israel.  The Constitution gives Congress broad oversight authority to make  sure the executive branch is serving the American people. As chairman,  I have worked hard to demand accountability from the administration. It  hasn't always been easy, but during this Congress, the committee has  succeeded in shining a light on some pretty troubling developments at  the State Department.  It is important that this work continue into the next Congress, even  as the Trump administration ends and President-elect Biden takes  office. After all, we don't conduct oversight just for the sake of  conducting oversight. It shouldn't be used as a political tool. If  existing laws and regulations aren't up to the task of preventing  abuses and mismanagement, then we need to remedy these weaknesses. It  is up to Congress to bend back the crooked branch.  I am confident that my successor, my friend from New York City, just  like me, Gregory Meeks, will carry the committee's work forward with  distinction. I am glad that he is replacing me as chairman of the  Foreign Affairs Committee, and I know that he will do a wonderful job.  It is on that point, the Foreign Affairs Committee's work, that I  take the most pride. I have said for a long time that the Foreign  Affairs Committee is the most bipartisan committee in Congress. Even at  a time when our politics are so polarized, the members of our committee  have worked together to advance American interests, values, and  leadership around the world.  We don't always agree. We have had heated debates in this Chamber  over war powers, weapons sales, and more. But when we debate, we debate  on the merits of the policy. Then we cast our votes. Immediately after,  we get back to working together toward policies that leave politics at  the water's edge.  We have always said that the Foreign Affairs Committee is the most  bipartisan committee in Congress, and it is. We have always said that  politics should stop at the water's edge when Members of Congress are  leaving our country and going to other countries because when we are  there, Democrats and Republicans, traveling together, we represent the  United States of America, and so partisanship should stop at the  water's edge. We have worked very hard to do that.  Michael McCaul has worked very hard to do that, and I wish that we  would have more of that in Congress, realizing that we are all  representing our districts back home, our districts and constituencies  are different, and we are all trying to do the best we can.  And I respect my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who work hard.  People coming up to me and wishing me congratulations come from both  parties, and for that I am deeply, deeply grateful.  So as I said, we don't always agree. We have had heated debates in  this Chamber over war powers, weapons sales, and more. But when we  debate, we debate on the merits of the policy. Then we cast our votes.  Immediately after, we get back to working together towards policies  that leaves politics at the water's edge. That has always been the  culture of the Foreign Affairs Committee.  As I said before, I am grateful to my partner in maintaining that  tradition, our ranking member, my friend from Texas, Michael McCaul.  We have become good friends. We have represented our country together  overseas and we have wrapped up a lot of legislative victories. I  certainly will miss working with him.  You know, Members generally don't get to know each other. I said it  before, if you are not on the same committee as someone, you will not  know that person. If that person is not from your State, you probably  won't know that person. And if you haven't traveled with that American,  or done other things, you won't know that person.  We have got to change that. We have got to know each other. We have  got to work with each other. We have got to accept each other. We are  all here because we love the United States of America.  So with so much left on the Foreign Affairs Committee to do, I know  Gregory Meeks will do a fine job of leading the committee. In the 117th  Congress, I hope the Foreign Affairs Committee continues to take on  these challenges. Congress needs to reclaim its authority in foreign  policy that has been chipped away year after year, in deference to the  executive branch, no matter who is in the executive branch.  We need to make the State Department authorization act a regular part  of Congress' work. And Congress needs to reassert its authority over  war powers. I am confident that the committee can do big things, that  Congress still has the capacity to do big things, to govern.  We are here to govern. We come to Washington from 441 different  communities, each with its unique character and concerns and  priorities. That is 441 elected officials whose job it is to stand up  for our constituents to make their voices heard. But we cannot lose  sight of the fact that the House of Representatives--not 441  individuals, but the body we constitute--has a responsibility to  govern.  When I came here 32 years ago, the two parties looked very different  from the way they look now: Southern Democrats and Rockefeller  Republicans. The diffusion of political ideologies across the aisle  made it necessary for the two sides to seek out compromise if the House  was going to get its work done. [["", Page , H7256, ]    {time} 1730  As the parties have realigned over the years, it has become harder  and harder for the House to advance anything that stands a chance at  becoming law except noncontroversial measures or must-pass legislation  like the defense authorization and spending bills.  Frankly, again, as I said, it has become harder and harder just to  get to know one another. I am a pretty progressive Democrat by most  measures, but I always thought it was important to cultivate  relationships with my Republican colleagues. We need to try to build  cross-party bonds. We need to work together with all Members of the  House.  I may disagree with someone on 95 percent of policy questions, but if  you don't know a person, Mr. Speaker, then you don't stand a chance of  finding the 5 percent in common and trying to build on it. If you don't  know a person, Mr. Speaker, it is so much easier to dismiss his or her  motives, and that is really where things start to fall apart.  No Member of this body doesn't love America. We share wildly  different visions of the best way for America to meet its full  potential, of the best way to improve the lives of the American people,  but we all love our country. And I worry that more and more Members are  mired in mistrust on the other side or saddled with purity tests,  making it difficult to build relationships and seek common ground.  We have to resist the urge to let the perfect be the enemy of the  good. This doesn't mean abandoning our principles or losing sight of  our goals. It means acknowledging the progress in our political system  takes time and perseverance. It means understanding that, as convinced  as I might be that my view is the correct one, a big chunk of this body  and of this country is likely to disagree. It means taking wins where  we can get them, even if they are modest. Because when we accomplish  even a little bit of good here, we haven't done so in service of an  idea or our party. We have done it for the American people. That is  what it means to govern, and we are here to govern.  For example, I am a proud member of the Medicare for All Caucus.  Going all the way back to my time in the State house in Albany, I have  supported single-payer healthcare. I hope to see Medicare for All in my  lifetime. But that hasn't stopped me, over the last three decades, from  voting for legislation that I thought would move the needle in the  right direction.  I was never under the illusion that we would get there with one  swing. But we did get the Children's Health Insurance Program, and we  did get the Affordable Care Act, which has made a difference in the  lives of millions of Americans. It was real progress, which we are  defending even today.  It was also more than a decade ago, and our country still faces  massive challenges when it comes to healthcare and a range of other  issues. We owe it to the American people to try to govern, to try to  work together, not to reflexively reject what the other side says, not  root our entire agenda in trying to make political gains in the next  election, not to ignore facts and science and reality because political  allegiances demand it.  And, yes, that means acknowledging the results of last month's  election and supporting the smooth transfer of power next month when  President-elect Biden takes office as President of the United States.  The Constitution has given the American people this body, the House  of Representatives. In turn, the House has given our country the 13th  Amendment, suffrage for women, Social Security and Medicare, the Civil  Rights Act, and the Voting Rights Act. They weren't easy victories, but  if our predecessors in Congress hadn't tried, then they would never  have been victories at all.  As we enter the dark winter of this pandemic, we know there is light  at the end of the tunnel. Today in the United Kingdom and soon the  United States, the most vulnerable are being vaccinated against this  deadly disease. That will soon happen here. But so much work remains  before we can get back to normal.  People are out of work, out of money, and out of food. The American  people will look to this body to govern. I know in my heart that we can  put the American people first and answer the call at this pivotal  moment in our country's history.  The future success of the American people depends on the success of  the House in meeting this challenge. So, I will be rooting for all of  you.  It has been a pleasure being your colleague. It has been a pleasure  working with you. It has been a pleasure watching how hard you work and  what we do for the American people. Thank you for letting me be your  colleague. Thank you for being so kind to me and my family.  When my son, who is now 34, my middle child, came to the House when I  was first elected, he was 2 years old. My daughter was 7, and my other  son wasn't born yet. He used to point to the Capitol, and he used to  say: ``Capitol. Daddy works there.'' We would all kind of laugh and  think he was really, really cute. Well, today, he is 34 years old, and  my three children have grown up with Congress, with the House, and they  know how much it means to me to be a Member of this House and how much  it means to them to learn all the things that we have been doing for  the past several years.  I will never forget this place. I hope to come back and visit several  times. I will never forget my colleagues and my friends. I will never  forget that I am fortunate and we are fortunate to be Americans, to  love this country, to help move the country to policies that we think  are best for the country and for the world.  So, I won't be a Member here, but I certainly will continue to have  many friends here and will watch and see what this Congress does. We  have some tremendously talented people.  Again, I want to thank the Speaker, Nancy Pelosi; the majority  leader, Steny Hoyer; and others as well who really have helped me and  have been part and parcel of what I have done. Jim Clyburn, thank you  as well.  My colleagues, life is bittersweet, and there are happy and sad  things that sometimes come together. I am happy because I have had the  privilege of serving here. I am happy because I like to think that I  have done good for people in this country. But I am sad to be leaving  this body.  To my colleagues, I will be watching you; I will be proud; I will see  what goes on; and I will stand by the TV or any other place and say:  These are my colleagues, and they are very, very good. They care.  It has been an honor and a privilege to be a Member of Congress in  the United States of America. I am so grateful to have had that  privilege.  Thank you to all my colleagues. Best wishes, and God bless America.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "

144,Anna Eshoo,1.898498773574829,D,eshoo,eshoo," Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 that funds our government and  provides desperately needed relief to American families. I'm proud to  support many of the provisions in this legislation, understanding that  no compromise is perfect. Frontline workers, including public health  workers, firefighters, and other essential workers employed by state  and local governments continue to need our support.  The bill before us today provides a lifeline to those who are  struggling from the COVID-19 pandemic and the recession it has caused.  It extends critical programs first authorized by the CARES Act  including $300 per week in additional unemployment benefits, a second  round of direct payments of up to $600, $284 billion for additional  small business loans under the Paycheck Protection Program, and $13  billion in nutrition assistance for Americans facing hunger. It also  provides $25 billion to help renters pay their rent and stay in their  homes. I'm deeply disappointed that the Administration and the Senate  Majority Leader would not allow restaurants and their workers to  receive our help. With over 300 bipartisan cosponsors on the RESTAURANT  Act, these businesses and their workers should have been in this  legislation.  In addition to pandemic relief, the bill funds the government through  the remainder of the fiscal year, avoiding a costly government shutdown  before the holidays, and invests in critical priorities, including  clean energy, affordable housing, public schools, and broadband. I'm  proud to have secured $100 million for the electrification of Caltrain,  $8.9 million for environmental conservation of the San Francisco Bay,  $33 million for construction of the Linac Coherent Light Source upgrade  (LCLS-II) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, and $85.2 million  for the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) at  NASA Ames.  Our country is in the midst of the worst public health crisis in a  century, and I'm proud to say that the Democrats on the Energy and  Commerce Health Subcommittee, which I have had the privilege to lead,  have stepped up to the challenge by securing provisions that include  the following:  Provide billions to ensure the free, timely, and equitable  distribution of safe, effective vaccines and more resources for a  national testing strategy:  End surprise medical billing. No patient will face an unexpected,  expensive bill just because they are caught in a web of providers.  Assist doctors and public and rural hospitals survive the pandemic by  stopping planned Medicare and Medicaid cuts.  Provide three years of funding for critical public health programs  including Community Health Centers, Teaching Health Centers, the  National Health Service Corps, and the special diabetes programs.  Restore Medicaid coverage for the citizens of the freely associated  states living in the U.S., to whom America has for too long abandoned  its commitments to.  Improve Medicare coverage for beneficiaries across the country by  simplifying Part B enrollment; permanently authorizing the use of  telehealth for mental health care; eliminating cost-sharing for  colorectal cancer screenings; and extending coverage for  immunosuppressive drugs for kidney transplant patients. I'm especially  proud to have co-led and championed the immunosuppressive drug coverage  legislation to correct a short-sighted coverage policy [["", Page , H7310, ] which will save 375 kidney transplants each year. This provision  appears in Section 402 of Division CC and is based on ', H.R. 5534, "", the  Comprehensive Immunosuppressive Drug Coverage for Kidney Transplant  Patients Act of 2019.  Improve the Medicaid program by expanding access to certified  community behavioral health clinics; eliminate spousal impoverishment  for partners of Medicaid beneficiaries receiving home and community- based services; and continuing the Money Follows the Person rebalancing  demonstration which makes it possible for people on Medicaid to  transition to a safer home or community-based environment and still  maintain Medicaid funding.  Lower health care costs by strengthening parity in mental health and  substance use disorder benefits; removing gag clauses on health price  and quality information; ending a loophole that allowed drugs for  opioid use disorder to benefit from the orphan drug designation; and  making it easier for biosimilar products to come to market by  increasing patent and exclusivity transparency. This final provision  appears in Section 325 of Division BB, and it is a bill I'm proud to  have sponsored, "", H.R. 1520, "", the Purple Book Continuity Act. It requires  patent information for biologics to be submitted to the FDA and  published in the publicly-available ``Purple Book.'' By creating a  single, searchable list of licensed biologics, manufacturers will be  able to plan a pipeline of lower-cost biosimilar products for years to  come.  I'm also proud to have several health appropriations which I  requested included in today's agreement. These items represent the  critical advancement of life-saving research and care, including: $15  million for the Pancreatic Cancer Research Program at the DOD, which  I've long championed and which comes as the world continues to mourn  the deaths this year of several iconic Americans from this very  aggressive cancer, including Congressman John Lewis and Supreme Court  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg; $42.9 billion for the NIH for forward  thinking investments in medical research; $597 million for critical  biodefense and public health emergency preparedness at BARDA, which my  legislation created. Another $19.7 billion is in the COVID-19 relief  agreement for BARDA to manufacture and procure vaccines; $350 million  for the Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education Program to  support pediatric medical residents' training; and $5.4 million for  research on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome at the CDC to better understand  this terrible disease.  There's still so much more the American people need. We must increase  federal funding for the Medicaid program during this health and  economic crisis, including home-and-community-based services, improve  infection control and quality in our nation's nursing homes, and  address the public health crises that continue during the COVID-19  pandemic, such as America's unacceptable rates of maternal mortality,  suicides, and overdoses. I'm proud of what we've accomplished in the  Health Subcommittee this year and energized to continue the fight in  2021.  Today's agreement includes important clean energy provisions,  including my legislation, "", H.R. 1420, "", the Energy Efficient Government  Technology Act, which appears as Sections 1003 and 1004 of Division Z.  The bill requires government agencies to develop plans to implement  best practices for energy management, purchase more energy efficient  information and communications technologies, and submit to periodic  evaluation of their data centers for energy efficiency.  Data centers are a critical part of our national infrastructure and  are found in nearly every sector of our economy. The federal government  alone has more than 2,000 data centers which store everything from  Social Security and tax records, toe-books at the Library of Congress.  Despite their importance to our government and our economy, many are  extremely inefficient when it comes to energy use.  The good news is many data centers can significantly reduce their  energy use using existing technology and best practices. This will  reduce not only the government's carbon footprint but also its energy  bills. My bipartisan legislation has the potential to save taxpayers  hundreds of millions of dollars in reduced energy costs in the future,  while setting an example for the private sector to reduce energy usage  at data centers.  We must ensure students in need can continue their studies during the  pandemic as colleges begin another semester of remote learning, and I'm  proud that our agreement includes funding for these students. Section  902 of Division N is modeled on "", H.R. 6814, "", the Supporting Connectivity  for Higher Education Students in Need Act, bicameral legislation I  introduced on May 13, 2020.  The provision provides $285 million to expand connectivity for  historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal colleges and  universities, Hispanic-serving institutions and other minority-serving  institutions, their students, and minority-owned businesses near those  colleges. The funding can be used to purchase routers, modems, wi-fi  hotspots, tablets, and laptops. Funding recipients must prioritize low- income students. The legislation also establishes the Office of  Minority Broadband Initiatives within the NTIA to carry out programs  expand access to broadband at and in communities around HBCUs, TCUs,  HSis and other MSis.  Between 2012 and 2018, over $1.2 billion in 9-1-1 fees were diverted  to uses other than 9-1-1. While most states curtailed this horrific  practice, four states continue diverting 9-1-1 fees: New Jersey, New  York, Rhode Island, and Nevada. I first co-led the bipartisan 9-1-1 Fee  Integrity Act to require by statute that 9-1-1 fees can only be used  for 9-1-1 purposes on September 14, 2018. I'm pleased that the  legislation appears in Section 902 of Division FF.  I'm pleased that today's agreement includes funding for AI R&D. The  Joint Explanatory Statement for Division B includes direction for AI  R&D to expand at NSF and NIST, including with a focus on increasing AI  workforce diversity and developing a framework for ethical and safe AI.  I've twice written to the House Appropriations Subcommittee on  Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies requesting robust AI  R&D funding, and I thank them for their leadership in taking an  important step to increase AI funding.  I'm pleased that this legislation includes funding for several  technology and telecommunications matters that are priorities for me  and for our country, including $3.2 billion for a $50 per month  emergency broadband benefit for low income families, Pell Grant  recipients, students eligible for free or reduced lunch, and recently  unemployed individuals; $1.9 billion to `rip and replace'  telecommunications equipment made by insecure supplies, like Huawei and  ZTE, which I first asked the FCC to investigate in 2010; $250 million  for the FCC's COVID-19 Telehealth Program; and $65 million to develop  reliable broadband maps which are critical for the federal government  and all states to know where broadband support funding would be most  effective.

146,Ron Estes,0.06958094984292984,R,estes,estes," Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friend, Mr. Lamborn,  for holding this special hour.  For our Nation's Founding Fathers, the Bible was a guiding light and  provided them the wisdom to build a strong foundation for the United  States, a nation that recognizes and protects our God-given rights.  The teachings in the Bible are intertwined with American beliefs and  values, showing us truth, sacrifice, and compassion for others.  In Isaiah 45:13, God called on Cyrus to bring freedom to His people.  He says:  I have raised them up in righteousness, and I will direct   all his ways; he shall rebuild My city and let My exiles go   free, not for price nor reward.  Just as God called upon Cyrus centuries ago, He calls each of us to  serve Him and our fellow man. Not only that, but God equips us with His  Word and His Holy Spirit.  We serve Him by advocating for the weakest among us and giving a  voice to the voiceless. We do this in His name, not for reward, but out  of love for our fellow man. That servant attitude should be followed,  whether you are a Member of Congress, a farmer, or a machinist on a  manufacturing line.  I am so grateful for His calling in my life and for His Word that is  a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.    "
147,Dwight Evans,0.14114992320537567,D,evans,evans," Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, in my city of Philadelphia and across the  country, people of color are thrown in jail more and with harsher  sentences than White people for the same cannabis-related crimes.  Cannabis is one of the fastest growing U.S. industries, but Federal  law keeps many businesses of color out of this market. That is why I  urge my colleagues to support passage of a jobs bill, the MORE Act. It  would decriminalize cannabis at the Federal level and expunge prior  Federal convictions related to marijuana. Half of all States have  already decriminalized cannabis.  This jobs bill would also create the opportunity trust fund, which  would generate grant programs to provide services and funds to those  most negatively impacted by the war on drugs. This includes the  equitable cannabis licensing program that I introduced in the Homegrown  Act.  The House and Senate need to pass the MORE Act now, as the growing  cannabis industry is an important economic development tool for  communities of color like mine. Let's pass this jobs bill.    "
148,Drew Ferguson,0.30873745679855347,R,ferguson,ferguson," Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman and the  ranking member for this opportunity, and I rise to support "", H.R. 3539, "".  Every American wants to live in a safe community, and children  deserve to be able to go to safe schools. But all too often, that  safety has been ruined by violence to self or others.  The Behavioral Intervention Guidelines, or BIG, Act combats this  mental health epidemic head-on by providing local communities and  school systems with the tools they need to help identify those most in  need.  All across the country, schools like Columbus State University in my  home State of Georgia and Texas Tech in Lubbock, Texas, have  implemented behavioral intervention programs following the 2008 tragedy  at Virginia Tech.  Dr. Chip Reese at Columbus State University and other university  leaders, like Dr. Billy Phillips at Texas Tech, report that, as a  result of these programs, they have seen universities' culture change  and are helping to get at-risk students back on the right track.  This important legislation would foster this approach by providing  Federal guidance in the form of best practices. Once established, these  best practices will be disseminated on the HHS website, and HHS would  provide technical assistance for elementary, secondary, and higher  education institutions that are looking to create their own behavioral  health intervention teams.  Now more than ever, our students should have the proper resources and  a supportive community around them to benefit their mental health. I  strongly urge my colleagues to support this important piece of  legislation.    "
149,Abby Finkenauer,1.4020259380340576,D,finkenauer,finkenauer," Ms. FINKENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say thank you to this  body and to the constituents of Iowa's [["", Page , H7102, ] First Congressional District for giving me the honor to serve these  last few years, and also my incredible staff, who both here and in Iowa  have given their all to Iowa and to this country. You have made me  proud every single day to know you.  Importantly, I also want to say thank you to my family: my husband,  Daniel, who has been my rock and been with me every step of the way; to  my siblings and nieces and nephews, who have taught me to never take  myself too seriously; and to my parents, who I know are watching right  now because, as I found out within the first 6 months of being in  Congress, they actually DVR and record C-SPAN every day so that they  can find me on the floor during votes.  You know, I think back to the day that they came to visit right  before swearing in. My very first visitors to my congressional office,  where my dad, Jerry, a UA retired union pipefitter welder, and my mom,  a retired public school secretary, held hands and walked through the  door of their 29-year-old daughter's congressional office.  I can't imagine what they thought, but I hope it was better than when  I told them and sat them down at the age of 24 and said I was running  for Iowa's State House, where my mom blurted out, ``Why in the heck are  you doing that?''  Well, it has been 7\\1/2\\ years since mom asked that question, and I  hope every day they have seen the answer.  The reason I entered public service was because of them. You see, my  parents couldn't give me a trust fund or debt-free college, but what  they gave me was worth a hell of a lot more.  They taught me about treating people with respect, and seeing work to  be done and doing it; about standing up for those who need a voice;  and, most importantly, to never think you are better than anyone else  no matter what you do or where you go.  The work I have done both in Iowa and here in Congress has been  shaped by the stories and the lives of my constituents and my family,  from my late grandfathers, one a firefighter and one a Purple Heart  World War II vet who worked in a meat packing plant, to my uncles; from  a former UPS driver to a small business owner; and my mother-in-law and  my sister-in-law, both who are heroes and nurses.  Because of them, my fight for working families, wage protections,  collective bargaining, paid leave, workplace protections, have  continued to be, in every sense of the word, personal, and that is the  way policy should be.  These laws we pass--and, unfortunately on some occasions don't pass  because of stalemates--aren't just dollars and cents on a page. They  are affecting people's lives.  I hope for this body and for the American people that we can have a  Congress and a Senate who sees that and understands the value of public  service.  Until we get there fully, I hope that young people across the country  find their ``why'' and run. We need you. And when you get here, I hope  you do the work and I hope you find an incredible staff like I did to  help you do it.  You see, this place is not about the crystal chandeliers or the fancy  titles. It is about the work. It is about the people in your district.  It is about finding common ground where you can and just getting things  done.  I have been proud to get to work with my staff the way that we did  passing my first bill within the first 2 weeks, becoming the youngest  woman in the history of this body to ever pass a bill through this  floor; to working on the Small Business Committee and beginning to  chair the Rural Development, Ag, Trade and Entrepreneurship  Subcommittee, where we got to fight for things like better access to  markets for our farmers and for our small business owners; to stepping  up for our childcare workers, who need it most right now; and the work  that we did on that Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, along  with the honorable Chairman DeFazio, getting to help pass some of the  best investments in rural infrastructure that has ever come out of  either one of these Chambers; to standing here, I think in this very  spot, having to fight back against attacks on Davis-Bacon wages, good  wage protections, in the middle of a pandemic; to helping our farmers,  our biofuel industries, trying to fight for and also getting done the  biodiesel tax credit extender; to, again, one of the things I might be  most proud of, standing here sharing a story that was hard to tell  about my own battle with endometriosis, and then fighting and working  with my staff to help double that funding for research that had been at  the bottom of the National Institutes of Health's research for years.  I also just want to say a special thank you to the staff in Iowa, who  have been there for my constituents in one of the toughest years we've  ever had, this pandemic, where they have taken calls from folks  wondering about their unemployment checks, wondering about how they are  going to be able to feed their family because they are unemployed right  now through no fault of their own, to then, on top of it, going almost  2 weeks without electricity post-derecho in my district, which was  basically like a Category 4 hurricane that came through and decimated  large parts of my district.  The way that my staff stepped up when, again, they themselves didn't  even have electricity or WiFi is extraordinary. You make me proud every  day.  And the way that my constituents came together, it made me proud to  be a Congresswoman and to be an Iowan.  You see, I, again, just want to say one last big thank you to my  staff. You are all incredible public servants that I am blessed to have  known and some of the best public servants I have ever met. And I  should know, because I met one of the best.  That late grandfather I talked about, that firefighter, he was the  one who taught me what all of this was. You see, he is the guy that I  would sit around the kitchen table with when I was 10 talking about  what was happening in the world. And he is also the guy that taught me  what public service should be. You see, when he would run into a  burning building to save people's lives, he didn't call and ask first:  What color is your skin? Where are you from? Who do you love? What  language do you speak?  He just showed up and he helped people, and he did his job.  That is what I have tried to do here every single day, both here in  Congress and my 4 years in the State House in Iowa. It is what I will  continue to do in whatever I do next.  It has been an honor and a privilege to get to serve in this body and  represent this district and this country.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
150,Brian Fitzpatrick,0.44038161635398865,R,fitzpatrick,fitzpatrick," Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a  very special human being, Mr. Charles Ellzy, who our community lost  earlier this year.  Mr. Speaker, Charles was a proud graduate of Bensalem High School and  Temple University.  In 1963, Charles met the love of his life, Rosia. They would go on to  have two children, Samantha and Vincent.  Charles dedicated his entire life to bettering our community. He  spent over 25 years working for the Department of Defense in  Philadelphia, and Charles was also the president of the Lin-Park Civic  Association.  Under his leadership, the LPCA established a community baseball  league, organized fundraising events, and collaborated with Betz  Laboratories to create the Lin-Park Betz Scholarship.  Mr. Speaker, Charles also served for years as a deacon at the  Linconia Tabernacle Christian Center in Bensalem. His connection and  love for God fueled his complete and total dedication to others.  And in August, the Bensalem Township Council unanimously passed a  resolution renaming Warren Avenue to Charles Ellzy Way in his honor.  Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, I had the honor of joining Charles'  family and congregants of the Linconia Tabernacle Christian Center for  the unveiling of such a fitting tribute to an amazing man.  Mr. Speaker, we are extremely grateful for Charles' contributions,  for his 80 years of life, and may the spirit of his generosity and  service continue to inspire our community. Charles is now reaping the  reward of a life he spent serving others.    "
151,Charles Fleischmann,0.23725034296512604,R,fleischmann,fleischmann," Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Before I begin, I wish to convey my warm thoughts and sentiments to  Mrs. Lowey from New York, who is chairman of this committee. It has  been a privilege to work with you for almost a decade in my capacity,  and I wish you the best in your future. And I thank you for your  service to this great House.  {time} 1900  Mr. Speaker, tonight, I rise in support of the bill we have before  us, which is the result of months of negotiations on how best to manage  our government's resources in fiscal year 2021 and respond to the COVID  pandemic that has gripped so many of our communities.  Mr. Speaker, as the ranking member of the Homeland Security  Subcommittee, I thank my full committee leader, Ms. Granger, for her  great leadership in pulling this omnibus together. I also thank  Subcommittee Chairwoman Ms. Roybal-Allard from California, along with  Senators Capito and Tester across the hall, for their work and comity  in resolving these difficult and challenging issues. It is a pleasure  to have served with Chairwoman Roybal-Allard in this role.  Mr. Speaker, I think we have a very balanced agreement. We continue  to provide $1.375 billion for border security and funds flexibility for  Immigration and Customs Enforcement to respond to detention needs.  Further, we have significant investments in many of our Nation's  security components, including the great United States Coast Guard,  cybersecurity and infrastructure, and FEMA grants to our States and  localities to respond to disasters.  Further, the bill before us eliminates the riders and policy  provisions contained in the House-reported bill that would have  inhibited the Department of Homeland Security from fulfilling its law  enforcement responsibilities at our borders and in the interior of our  country.  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this package. It is time for  the fiscal year to get underway.  Mr. Speaker, I wish all a happy and healthy new year.    "

Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Johnson for this  opportunity and for her bipartisan leadership of the Committee on  Science, Space, and Technology during this Congress.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of ', H.R. 4447, ' and the important  bills from the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology that are  included in this bill.  I am proud to represent Houston, Texas, the energy capital of the  world, and our country leads the world in energy production and  innovation because of the work that we do in Houston. We innovate, we  create, we research, and we power the world.  ', H.R. 4447, "" will help ensure that we continue to do so with a  meaningful increase in the Federal resources necessary to develop  critical energy technologies that we will rely on in our energy mix  into the next century.  As the center of energy expertise and experience in the country, my  constituents in Houston are well-positioned to utilize the financial  support provided through this bill and to help chart the course for our  energy future.  I am particularly glad that to expand research and development of  large-scale demonstration of carbon capture, utilization and storage  technologies, this package includes legislation I helped lead with my  friend from Fort Worth, Mr. Veasey, the Fossil Energy Research and  Development Act.  Critical work on carbon capture is going on right now in my district,  and we have a real opportunity to reduce carbon emissions through these  and other carbon capture efforts.  To continue the important work of modernizing the use of fossil  fuels, Houston companies and universities will be eligible to compete  for an estimated $14 billion in grant funds made possible by this bill.  I am also glad that this bill includes the ARPA-E Reauthorization,  legislation passed through our subcommittee to reauthorize funding for  the Department of Energy's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy to  help advance high-potential, high-impact technologies in the early  stages of development.  While I support these and other important provisions of this bill, I  recognize that it is not a perfect bill. I am disappointed that my  amendment to address some outstanding issues related to eminent domain  and pipeline construction was not made in order.  Our conversation about our energy future is vital for all of us. I  look forward to continuing my work with my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to ensure that we are able to build the infrastructure we  need to ensure the reliable delivery of American energy across the  country and to collaborate on the essential research that we need and  that we focused on so much in our committee work.  In the energy capital of the world, we have unique and critical  expertise to offer this conversation, and it will help us chart a path  forward together.  Madam Speaker, this bill represents some of the things we can do  together. And for that reason, I will vote in favor of it, and I urge  my colleagues to do the same.  {time} 1745    "
153,Bill Flores,0.3863523602485657,R,flores,flores," Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th birthday of Edythe  Kengla Swann.  Edythe was born on December 5, 1920, in Tucson, Arizona, to Herman  Kengla and Joaquina Robles Kengla. She is a descendant of Arizona's  pioneering ranching and railroad families.  Since childhood, Edythe was instilled with a pioneering spirit. Her  grandfather, Bernabe Robles, was an immigrant from Mexico who  established a stagecoach shop in Arizona that ultimately became the  Robles Ranch in the mid-1880s. The ranching complex ultimately  comprised over one million acres, making it one of the largest ranches  in Arizona.  Edythe graduated from the University of Arizona in 1941 with a degree  in home economics. As the United States entered World War II, more  women were being called upon to fill jobs that were previously held by  men. Edythe was determined to take advantage of the new opportunities  opening around her. Enamored by the possibility of travel, Edythe  became a flight attendant for American Airlines.  Flight attendant school was an immersive environment of rigorous  training in a multitude of subjects. Edythe became well-versed in the  technical side of flying. She excelled in meteorology and was well- prepared for difficult emergencies during flight. Edythe also took  great interest in the maintenance of the DC-3 aircraft and was very  knowledgeable about the inner workings of many cockpit systems.  Edythe diligently worked to meet industry expectations and create an  atmosphere that eased the concerns of her passengers while promoting  the airline industry. She loved being a pioneer in a profession that  represented new opportunities to women and allowed them to find freedom  through adventure.  While Edythe was stationed with American Airlines in El Paso, she met  Richard Earnest Swann, a lieutenant in the Army stationed at Fort  Bliss. Edythe and Richard quickly fell in love and were married in  1945. At the time, airlines required that flight attendants be  unmarried, so Edythe made the difficult choice to leave behind her  beloved career for her new future as a wife and a mother.  Together, Edythe and Richard raised five children and started their  own business, representing lamp and home furnishing manufacturers in  Dallas, Texas. Edythe worked hard to assist her husband at the store  while raising their children and becoming an active member of their  community. She served as a precinct chairman and was an avid volunteer  at her church for local events.  In 2017, Edythe was widowed after 72 years of marriage. Together,  Richard and Edythe had 5 children, 12 grandchildren, and 15 great- grandchildren.  Today, Edythe remains independent in mindset and in ability. Her  pioneering spirit and moral resolve continue to serve as an inspiration  to her family.  Edythe Kengla Swann's life story exemplifies the opportunity afforded  to descendants of immigrants who pursue challenging careers that help  this country grow and whose self-determination and commitment to family  help to maintain the strength of American culture.  Mr. Speaker, Edythe Kengla Swann has lived a long life filled with  joy, love, and above all, a pioneering spirit. I am proud to recognize  her on this joyous occasion and know that her family and friends love  her and are proud of her. I wish Edythe many more years of health and  happiness in the future.  As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for their  country during these difficult times for our military men and women who  protect us from external threats and for our first responders who  protect us here at home.  Mr. Speaker, I hope all Americans have a great holiday season and a  very happy and joyous Christmas.    "

155,Bill Foster,0.6958767175674438,D,foster,foster," Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Clean Economy  Jobs and Innovation Act.  This act includes provisions from the bipartisan ', H.R. 2986, "", the  Better Energy Storage Act, or BEST Act, led by me, Mr. Casten, Ms.  Herrera Beutler, and Mr. Gonzalez.  These provisions set forth a crosscutting program at the Department  of Energy to advance a suite of energy storage technologies. It directs  DOE to establish a research and development program for cost-effective,  sustainable energy storage systems, including testing and validation  activities.  It directs the Department to develop a 5-year strategic plan to  continue to identify and refine research goals for the program, and it  would establish an energy storage demonstration program to help put  more energy storage systems on the electric grid.  Energy storage technologies take many forms, including batteries,  pumped hydropower, thermal energy storage, or chemical energy stored as  hydrogen. The development of cost-effective storage systems will help  reduce the intermittency issues of renewable generation sources like  solar and wind energy and will also help provide grid services, such as  frequency regulation to ensure the stability of the electrical supply  that consumers depend on. And they will begin to address the seasonal  variation, which is the final frontier of energy storage technology.  In my home district of Illinois, researchers at Argonne National Lab  are leading a national collaboration to accelerate the development of  advanced batteries, including novel cathode, anode, and electrolyte  designs, as well as new materials synthesis and characterization tools.  And that is why I am so pleased to see provisions of the BEST Act in  the Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act.  I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the hard work of my  colleague on the Science Committee, Mr. Casten, who introduced the  Promoting Grid Storage Act of 2019. His bill contained many important  provisions that have helped strengthen the version of the BEST Act that  we are considering within this package.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me and vote ``yes'' on  "", H.R. 4447, '.    "
156,Virginia Foxx,1.1664752960205078,R,foxx,foxx," Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, there has been a lot of  news coverage lately on coordinated efforts by the Chinese Communist  Party to infiltrate America's institutions.  I am particularly troubled by reports revealing efforts by the CCP to  exploit academic integrity on U.S. college campuses.  We know the CCP is using Confucius Institutes to further its agenda.  Located on college campuses across the U.S., Confucius Institutes use  their platform to spew Chinese Government propaganda.  While Democrats turn a blind eye to China's threat, I am proud my  Republican colleagues and I joined forces on the China Task Force and  made bipartisan recommendations to Congress on how best to counter  threats from the CCP.  There is no place for Chinese censorship in America, especially not  on college campuses where American ingenuity should take flight.  Congress must deliver a strong message: CCP propaganda will be met with  consequences.    "
157,Lois Frankel,0.3981986939907074,D,frankel,frankel," Ms. FRANKEL. Mr. Speaker, the COVID pandemic has brought so much  grief and desperation to so many people, and we have seen how millions  of Americans have rightfully stayed home to stay safe.  Our healthcare personnel, our police, our firefighters, our teachers,  and other vital workers, they have been in full force, many risking  their own lives to save ours. Today, we make sure that these heroes on  the front line get the pay that they need and deserve to do their jobs.  I urge passage of the HEROES Act.    "
158,Marcia Fudge,0.5473006963729858,D,fudge,fudge," Ms. FUDGE. Madam Speaker, on Friday, we lost an honorable and decent  woman, Justice Ginsburg, a person who changed the world.  But for all her successes, those who are bent on choosing her  successor have no decency. They have no honor. They have no integrity.  It is a shame that they did not learn the lessons of Justice Ginsburg,  which were decency and honesty and integrity, one who fought for  others.  All they want to do is fight for themselves. They want to take away  our healthcare. They don't want to help people who are in trouble. They  don't care about people who are unemployed. All they want to do is win.  But what do they win? What have they won for this Nation? They just  want to benefit themselves.  We are not here for ourselves. We are here for the people who sent us  here. We are here to represent the people.  When you lose sight of that, what a shame, what an absolute shame.  They are a disgrace to this Nation.    "
159,Russ Fulcher,0.23243547976016998,R,fulcher,fulcher," Mr. FULCHER. Madam Speaker, I stand in opposition to ', H.R. 4447, '. A  clean energy future is not possible without advanced nuclear energy.  We are in a global competition. Russia is building seven reactors in  Asia, has 22 more under contract in Asia and Europe, and proposals to  put more in Africa. China is on pace to double nuclear capacity by 2030  and has stated it wants to build 6 to 8 reactors a year. In the U.S. we  are currently building two.  If we fall behind, so does our national security and geopolitical  standing.  That is why I introduced the Next Generation Nuclear Advancement Act,  which was ruled out of order as an amendment. All sections of this act,  the Nuclear Energy Strategic Plan, and Integrated Energy and Light  Water Reactor Programs, have Senate counterparts with bipartisan  support.  These provisions need to be inserted for legislation to have a chance  at becoming law; anything less is only useful as a social media post.    "
160,Tulsi Gabbard,0.5616512894630432,D,gabbard,gabbard," Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, finally, this is a historic moment that so  many here and across the country have been working toward, to take this  step to end America's destructive and costly war on drugs that has  turned everyday Americans into criminals and torn families apart,  ruining so many people's lives.  This legislation removes cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act,  frees States to regulate it as they choose, and encourages research  into the medicinal qualities of this plant that we all already know are  changing people's lives and saving people's lives. It also applies  retroactively, expunging prior convictions and records, freeing a  generation of people from the shackles of this failed war on drugs.  Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is this vote is about freedom. It is  freedom of choice for every American to make their own decisions for  themselves without fear of the government coming and arresting them.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. The Senate  should pass it quickly so we can send it to the President for his  signature.    "
161,Matt Gaetz,0.06958094984292984,R,gaetz,gaetz," Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I oppose the NDAA, not because I am against  our troops, but because I love them so much.  America's fighting men and women are so precious that they should not  have to die in some failed state, some faraway land that most Americans  can't even point to on a map so that defense contractors can extend our  involvement in these wars, so that lobbyists can get rich, and so that  Members of Congress can get reelected.  This good bill has been hijacked by the forever war lobby and their  bought-and-paid-for allies in the United States Congress. It puts  barriers in the way of an administration that wants to bring our troops  home and put America first. This legislation has become too swampy. It  does good things to ensure that America can vanquish any foe on the  battlefield, but we should only fight when that fight is just and  proper.  Mr. Speaker, we have spent two decades trading the same villages back  and forth in Afghanistan. And I believe that the administration that  leads our country should work to bring those troops home, and  unfortunately, this bill does exactly the opposite. From Afghanistan,  from Germany, and elsewhere, I am going to put America first and I am  voting against this bill.    "
162,Mike Gallagher,0.6169635057449341,R,gallagher,gallagher," Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member not only for  yielding, but for his leadership and setting an example of just being  one of the most thoughtful legislators that I have ever witnessed, and  so I thank him for his mentorship and his leadership.  I am very proud to support this bill, which includes many of the  critical recommendations of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, which I  have had the privilege of co-chairing over the past year with my good  friend Senator Angus King, and serving alongside my distinguished  colleague and IETC Subcommittee Chairman Jim Langevin, who has  forgotten more about cybersecurity than most of us, certainly myself,  will ever know in our lifetime, and so his leadership has been  incredible.  Early on in the Commission's work, we recognized that one of our  greatest challenges would be navigating through the many committees of  jurisdiction, and it is precisely because of that challenge that I am  especially proud that we were able to work across party and  jurisdictional lines to get many of our key recommendations either in  the underlying text or in a bipartisan amendment.  I know over the course of the day, Congress will be advancing even  more of the Commission's recommendations, such as strengthening the  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, establishing a  national cyber director, establishing a joint planning office to  coordinate cyber planning and readiness.  Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank the committee chairman as well for  working with us and the rest of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission. A  great deal of effort went into our work. We had more than 50  legislative proposals. I am greatly thankful for his help and  everyone's help, and especially Representative Langevin, in getting the  work of the committee across the finish line.  There is no shortage of work left to be done to better secure us in  cyberspace, but today we are taking a number of very, very important  steps.    "
163,Ruben Gallego,2.628042459487915,D,gallego,gallego," Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, "", H.R. 5852, '.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
164,John Garamendi,0.6334449648857117,D,garamendi,garamendi," Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the final  ``Water Resources Development Act of 2020'' ("", S. 1811, ""). Working with  other members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I  am very pleased to reach agreement with the Senate on a truly  bipartisan bill and the fourth biennial Water Resources Development Act  (WRDA) to be passed by Congress since 2014.  My Congressional district includes 200 miles of the Sacramento River  and is adjacent to several major ports. WRDA 2020 includes key  provisions for the California Delta and Central Valley to authorize and  expedite construction of flood protection and aquatic ecosystem  restoration projects, address harmful algal blooms, and give local  agencies greater flexibility in using federal Army Corps funds to  better meet local needs. Under Chairman DeFazio's leadership, the bill  finally fixes the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund to ensure that regional  dredging and navigation projects are fully funded.  I secured Congressional authorization for the Delta Islands and  Levees Ecosystem Restoration Project, Yuba River Ecosystem Restoration  Project, and Sacramento Regional Groundwater Bank in WRDA 2020. These  projects provide critical flood protection and make local communities  across the Central Valley more resilient to climate change.  I also secured deauthorization of the Sacramento Riverbed Gradient  Restoration Facility and Western Pacific Interceptor Canal, returning  these former Army Corps projects to full local control.  WRDA 2020 also expedites completion of the Army Corps' feasibility  studies needed for the San Francisco Bay to Stockton Navigation  Improvement Project, Lower Cache Creek Flood Risk Management Project,  and Sutter Bypass and Sacramento River Basin Floodplain Management  Project. I look forward to securing Congressional authorization for  these projects once the Army Corps completes the requisite feasibility  studies.  Working with Rep. Doris O. Matsui (CA-06), I secured inclusion of our  ``Yolo Bypass System Improvement Act'' in WRDA 2020 to improve  coordinated planning for all restoration projects and federal  permitting in the Yolo Bypass.  Lastly, I am very pleased that the new Army Corps harmful algal bloom  program established under WRDA 2020 includes the California Delta as a  focus area. This will better protect the Delta's precious ecosystem  from toxic algal blooms.  The House report for WRDA 2020 includes my amendment directing the  Army Corps to report to Congress on implementation of the Small  Business Act across all the Corps' missions. This strengthens  Congressional oversight over the Corps' contracting process and ensures  that the Small Business Act is implemented fully in an equitably  distributed manner, as intended by Congress.  I want to extend a special appreciation to my colleague Rep. Grace F.  Napolitano (CA-32), chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Water Resources  and Environment, for her tireless work in this WRDA for the entire  California delegation. WRDA 2020 ensures that Army Corps projects in  California requiring earthquake-resistance and other seismic safety  costs remain equally competitive for federal funding compared to  projects in other states.  I urge all Members of Congress to support this bipartisan WRDA 2020,  which is expected to be signed into law this year. This two-year  authorization bill provides the federal support and certainty needed to  keep Army Corps projects across California on time and on budget.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, "", S. 1811, "", as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to provide  for improvements to the rivers and harbors of the United States, to  provide for the conservation and development of water and related  resources, and for other purposes.''.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
165,Jesus Garcia,0.5572408437728882,D,garcia,garcia," Mr. GARCIA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, we are close to finalizing a  relief package, but I ask my colleagues: Relief for whom?  A relief package without survival checks is not a relief package at  all, nor is a relief package that leaves out millions of immigrants and  their families. Any deal that we strike must include survival checks to  families and immigrants, and mixed-status families must be included.  Earlier this year, countless families that I represent were denied  stimulus checks, including U.S. citizens whose spouses are immigrants.  We even excluded children who may have an immigrant parent.  How in the world did we exclude U.S. citizen children?  In this season of sacred holidays, I implore all of us to be  compassionate and not punish kids for their parents' status. Families  are struggling to put food on their tables and keep roofs over their  heads.  Circumstances are dire. We need to put money directly into working  families' pockets. I urge my colleagues that any relief package must  include survival checks for everyone, including immigrant children.    "
166,Jesus Garcia,0.5572408437728882,D,garcia,garcia," Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Lee and the  caucuses involved for putting this Special Order together.  Today in America, there is not one State that has the pandemic under  control. My own State of Texas became the first State to surpass 1  million cases.  Let me repeat that: 1 million cases.  These cases represent many of our neighbors, our friends, and our own  family. I personally have self-quarantined once and have already been  tested four times for different times I have been exposed to someone  with the virus.  Thank God all tests have come back positive--I am sorry, negative. I  meant to say, ``not come back positive.'' Little misspeaking there.  Mr. Speaker, this pandemic is affecting everyone, but it is not  affecting everyone in the same way. Black and Latino communities are  bearing the weight of this pandemic. While Black and Latino people are  being hospitalized and dying at higher rates than White people, they  are also the ones most likely to be working jobs that put them more at  risk.  They have always been essential workers. Now more than ever, this is  sadly more true. They are meatpacking workers, farmworkers, sanitation  workers, custodians, restaurant workers, grocery clerks, postal  workers, police officers, firefighters, longshoremen. These aren't jobs  you can do from home. If you don't show up, you just don't get paid.  Black and Latino families have had to go into work even when it meant  they may get sick. And many of them have gotten sick. Even worse, many  infected a loved one with the virus.  America depends on these workers to put food on our tables and keep  us safe. Because our leaders didn't take any steps to prepare us for  this pandemic, we can't even offer the protective gear needed to keep  essential frontline workers safe.  So while we are asking these communities to go to work every day  without the proper protections, we also know that Latino and Black  Americans are more likely to have health conditions, like asthma and  diabetes, that make the virus even more dangerous.  Nationwide, Latinos make up 55 percent of the COVID cases and 24  percent of the overall deaths. Yet, we are only 18.5 percent of the  total U.S. population. In Texas, Latinos are about 40 percent of the  population, but we are nearly 55 percent of the deaths--more than half,  Mr. Speaker. In Houston, sadly, Latinos account for 54 percent of the  deaths caused by this virus--again, more than half.  My district, which is nearly 80 percent Latino, was one of the  hardest hit areas in the Houston region. But despite these numbers,  many of my constituents are still scared of getting tested or even  seeing the doctor. Many don't have health insurance. Others don't trust  our healthcare system. Many more are undocumented and fear deportation.  Mr. Speaker, now, I am optimistic about the future, given some of the  news about vaccine trials. However, we must make sure, once we have a  safe and effective vaccine, that it is distributed fairly and equitably  and that no one is left behind.  We do not need to repeat the disparate mistakes of the past. As  elected officials, we must work together to keep all of our  constituents safe.  Right now, with the virus rapidly spreading, we are losing precious  time if we don't act. People will get sick, and even more people will  die, if we wait any longer.  Legislation like the Heroes Act provides protections that working  families and frontline workers need now. It would provide rent relief  for families who are afraid of losing their homes. It would help our  schools keep kids healthy and safe for in-person learning. [["", Page , H5752, ] It would give local and State governments much-needed relief to retain  frontline workers on payroll. It would give hardworking families  another stimulus check. It would also reinstate the supplemental weekly  $600 in unemployment benefits, a lifeline that helped many families  stay afloat.  Lastly, we need to earn the trust of these communities and let them  know that, yes, they are a part of us. People of color know and must  know that we are working for them. We cannot save the economy if we  don't save people first.  Saving many lives must be our top priority. It will take all of us to  crush this virus, but I know that we will get together to make sure  that we are all working together to get past this pandemic, and if we  do, it will be for all of us. Todos juntos.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for this Special Order.    "
167,Jesus Garcia,0.5572408437728882,D,garcia,garcia," Mr. GARCIA of ILLINOIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Levin for  sharing that story, his own personal knowledge and experience of  working to empower working people so that they have good wages, good  working conditions and very critically what is at the heart of the PRO  Act, organizing to have leverage to level the playing field and to  arrive at what is the best contract for workers in a worksite setting.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), who  happens to be the chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor.    "
168,Jesus Garcia,0.5572408437728882,D,garcia,garcia," Mr. GARCIA of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of an American legend and aviation pioneer, General Chuck Yeager, who  passed away this past Monday, December 7.  Daring to be the first to break the sound barrier over California's  Mojave Desert, General Yeager achieved aviation history in 1947 and  launched the modern jet age. He did what many thought was impossible,  and he did it over the skies of my district.  But his dedication to our Nation and contribution to aeronautical  sciences was greater than this one crowning achievement. He served in  World War II as a fighter ace, shooting down 13 German planes--5 in one  day.  In 1953, he set a world speed record by flying at nearly 2\\1/2\\ times  the speed of sound.  From commanding the school training astronauts at Edwards Air Force  Base, to flying 127 missions as commander of a fighter wing in Vietnam,  to testing a Russian MiG-15 obtained from a defector, Chuck Yeager's  service to country and advancement of aviation never stopped throughout  his lifetime.  These accomplishments might have seemed unlikely in the beginning.  Possessing only a high school degree and becoming sick riding in his  first military flight as a passenger, he might have seemed an unlikely  milestone maker in military aviation. But, as he said in his memoir:  ``All I know is I worked my tail off learning to learn how to fly, and  worked hard at it all the way.''  As a fighter pilot myself, this is difficult for me to say, but Chuck  Yeager was truly the best fighter pilot this world has seen. Hard work,  determination, bravery, and service made Chuck Yeager a role model and  a uniquely American hero.  May God bless Chuck Yaeger, his family, and the Nation that he  served, and I hope Chuck is up there in Heaven setting more records.    "
169,Sylvia Garcia,0.7680389285087585,D,garcia,garcia," Mr. GARCIA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, we are close to finalizing a  relief package, but I ask my colleagues: Relief for whom?  A relief package without survival checks is not a relief package at  all, nor is a relief package that leaves out millions of immigrants and  their families. Any deal that we strike must include survival checks to  families and immigrants, and mixed-status families must be included.  Earlier this year, countless families that I represent were denied  stimulus checks, including U.S. citizens whose spouses are immigrants.  We even excluded children who may have an immigrant parent.  How in the world did we exclude U.S. citizen children?  In this season of sacred holidays, I implore all of us to be  compassionate and not punish kids for their parents' status. Families  are struggling to put food on their tables and keep roofs over their  heads.  Circumstances are dire. We need to put money directly into working  families' pockets. I urge my colleagues that any relief package must  include survival checks for everyone, including immigrant children.    "
170,Sylvia Garcia,0.7680389285087585,D,garcia,garcia," Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Lee and the  caucuses involved for putting this Special Order together.  Today in America, there is not one State that has the pandemic under  control. My own State of Texas became the first State to surpass 1  million cases.  Let me repeat that: 1 million cases.  These cases represent many of our neighbors, our friends, and our own  family. I personally have self-quarantined once and have already been  tested four times for different times I have been exposed to someone  with the virus.  Thank God all tests have come back positive--I am sorry, negative. I  meant to say, ``not come back positive.'' Little misspeaking there.  Mr. Speaker, this pandemic is affecting everyone, but it is not  affecting everyone in the same way. Black and Latino communities are  bearing the weight of this pandemic. While Black and Latino people are  being hospitalized and dying at higher rates than White people, they  are also the ones most likely to be working jobs that put them more at  risk.  They have always been essential workers. Now more than ever, this is  sadly more true. They are meatpacking workers, farmworkers, sanitation  workers, custodians, restaurant workers, grocery clerks, postal  workers, police officers, firefighters, longshoremen. These aren't jobs  you can do from home. If you don't show up, you just don't get paid.  Black and Latino families have had to go into work even when it meant  they may get sick. And many of them have gotten sick. Even worse, many  infected a loved one with the virus.  America depends on these workers to put food on our tables and keep  us safe. Because our leaders didn't take any steps to prepare us for  this pandemic, we can't even offer the protective gear needed to keep  essential frontline workers safe.  So while we are asking these communities to go to work every day  without the proper protections, we also know that Latino and Black  Americans are more likely to have health conditions, like asthma and  diabetes, that make the virus even more dangerous.  Nationwide, Latinos make up 55 percent of the COVID cases and 24  percent of the overall deaths. Yet, we are only 18.5 percent of the  total U.S. population. In Texas, Latinos are about 40 percent of the  population, but we are nearly 55 percent of the deaths--more than half,  Mr. Speaker. In Houston, sadly, Latinos account for 54 percent of the  deaths caused by this virus--again, more than half.  My district, which is nearly 80 percent Latino, was one of the  hardest hit areas in the Houston region. But despite these numbers,  many of my constituents are still scared of getting tested or even  seeing the doctor. Many don't have health insurance. Others don't trust  our healthcare system. Many more are undocumented and fear deportation.  Mr. Speaker, now, I am optimistic about the future, given some of the  news about vaccine trials. However, we must make sure, once we have a  safe and effective vaccine, that it is distributed fairly and equitably  and that no one is left behind.  We do not need to repeat the disparate mistakes of the past. As  elected officials, we must work together to keep all of our  constituents safe.  Right now, with the virus rapidly spreading, we are losing precious  time if we don't act. People will get sick, and even more people will  die, if we wait any longer.  Legislation like the Heroes Act provides protections that working  families and frontline workers need now. It would provide rent relief  for families who are afraid of losing their homes. It would help our  schools keep kids healthy and safe for in-person learning. [["", Page , H5752, ] It would give local and State governments much-needed relief to retain  frontline workers on payroll. It would give hardworking families  another stimulus check. It would also reinstate the supplemental weekly  $600 in unemployment benefits, a lifeline that helped many families  stay afloat.  Lastly, we need to earn the trust of these communities and let them  know that, yes, they are a part of us. People of color know and must  know that we are working for them. We cannot save the economy if we  don't save people first.  Saving many lives must be our top priority. It will take all of us to  crush this virus, but I know that we will get together to make sure  that we are all working together to get past this pandemic, and if we  do, it will be for all of us. Todos juntos.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for this Special Order.    "

Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Levin for  sharing that story, his own personal knowledge and experience of  working to empower working people so that they have good wages, good  working conditions and very critically what is at the heart of the PRO  Act, organizing to have leverage to level the playing field and to  arrive at what is the best contract for workers in a worksite setting.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), who  happens to be the chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor.    "

173,Greg Gianforte,1.1362662315368652,R,gianforte,gianforte," Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark National Suicide  Awareness Month.  Unfortunately, Montanans are all too familiar with the epidemic of  suicide. As we have faced this ongoing public health and economic  crisis, the demand for mental health services has grown.  In Gallatin County, my home, crisis response therapists have  experienced a higher volume of calls. Each month they receive more  calls than the last from people needing help. Centers throughout  Montana are seeing similar increases.  To confront the greater demand for services and to help people in  crisis, we must ensure access to necessary resources are available. One  crucial resource is the national suicide hotline.  I am grateful to my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, for  working with me to designate 988 as the hotline's number. I am proud of  that bipartisan accomplishment.  Let's continue to provide these critical resources for those who need  them the most and support them through their darkest hours.    "
174,Bob Gibbs,0.15904217958450317,R,gibbs,gibbs," Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, this bill provides funding that is already  there. Creating and peddling this conspiracy theory is irresponsible  and reckless. At a time when Russia and China are meddling in our  elections, we don't need help from Congress peddling fake news.  This is one bill that needs to be labeled, ``Return to sender.''  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the distinguished chair of  the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.    "
175,Louie Gohmert,0.10934149473905563,R,gohmert,gohmert," Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my Aggie friend and appreciate that  shout-out to what sounds like an incredible lady.  Mr. Speaker, my friend will be missed here in Congress. We have had  some disagreements, but I know his heart and I know he has always  wanted what is best for the country. And I greatly appreciate that  heart.  Mr. Speaker, perhaps I should have gotten more than two hours sleep  last night. I was thinking ``Jaime Beutler Herrera'' but it didn't  sound right. It is Jaime Herrera Beutler.  Mr. Speaker, she has a discharge petition, and I hope that if there  is any Republican that has not signed onto Jaime's discharge petition  that they will come do that as soon as possible. We need to get that  money. It has already been appropriated. It is just sitting there. Why  could we not agree on that?  I know that Ms. Herrera Beutler, I know Mr. Chabot, they would be  fine if [["", Page , H7142, ] the Democrats put somebody else's name on what they have done. That is  fine. Put Democrat names on it, but let's get it done. We are more  concerned about helping people that need the money after having their  businesses shut down, curtailed, cut back. Let's get that money to  them, and I hope that we will.  With regard to this election, on the one hand, you have got COVID  that is killing people. On the other hand, you have fraud that is  killing a nation. And we know it is serious because YouTube did  everything they could--as did Google and Twitter--to censor the public  dialogue about different types of fraud, investigations into the Biden  family. They did everything they could to hurt President Trump and to  help candidate Biden.  Now we see today, YouTube is going to start preventing any discussion  about fraud. So we know it is serious when YouTube has to take the  position as the totalitarian censor--basically, fascist censor, that  the high-tech industry has chosen to be--that they are going to  eliminate anybody's ability using their public forum to discuss the  facts of fraud.  And for those networks that say that they are unfounded, they need to  pull their heads out of the orifice, hole in the ground, whatever, in  which their heads are stuck because there have been hundreds and  hundreds of affidavits. There are thousands of examples of fraud in the  elections.  And as John Fund said, the biggest fraud about elections is the  statement ``there is no fraud in elections.'' It is not new. It has  just never, ever, anywhere in the history of the world, been utilized  in so many ways and with so many ballots as it has been in this  election.  {time} 1315  We have seen the gutless actions of some courts, some places that  have refused to take up critically important issues that will mean this  country has a future as a republic or will end that future and move us  into the socialism that brings totalitarianism. But they refuse to take  it up.  You can understand, if you have no courage, then you would rather not  take up an issue that might make some people mad, even though, as I  figured out early in my career as a judge, if I was going to run from  the job I ran for, I shouldn't even be there.  Most judges haven't figured that out. Some are appointed, but they  were appointed after they sought those positions. Well, if you are  going to run from the job you sought, you shouldn't have that job. Just  be honest and caring enough for the country that if you don't have the  guts to do the job, resign and go. You can mediate. You can arbitrate.  There is great money in arbitration. I had gone through the 3 days of  study and testing by the only institute at the time that prepared  people for international arbitration. There was great money in it. But  at the same time, I was told by a Member of Congress, now is the time  you need to start raising money.  Do I start raising money to run for Congress, or do I pursue the  extremely lucrative and rewarding career in international arbitration?  Well, I took the road less traveled by, and that has made all the  difference. Not a fun difference, but this is an important job. The  judiciary is an important job.  So, after the court refused to take up Mike Kelly's suit--totally  legitimate, should have been taken up--we have a lawsuit that was filed  a couple of nights ago by the Texas attorney general. It is styled  State of Texas v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, State of Georgia, State  of Michigan, and State of Wisconsin, so four defendants.  As Article III of our Constitution says: ``In all cases affecting  Ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a  State shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have original  jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned,'' which is up in  the first part of Section 2, ``the Supreme Court shall have appellate  jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under  such regulations as the Congress shall make.''  But this is a case, as the Constitution says, where the Constitution  provides for original jurisdiction in the Supreme Court. That means you  don't go to a lower court--not a magistrate, not a district judge, not  a court of appeals--but you go straight to the Supreme Court.  Now, I had filed things before in the Supreme Court, but I had never  filed an original action. I didn't realize until this week that on  something the Supreme Court is said by the Constitution to have  original jurisdiction, you can't just file. You have to come in and  beg: Oh, please, please, Mount Zion judges, please allow me leave so I  can file this petition because you have original jurisdiction over this  controversy, according to Article III of our Constitution.  Apparently, the Supreme Court has previously decreed that if you want  to file an original action, according to the Constitution, in our  Court, you have to come in and beg us for leave to file such an  original action. We may or may not let you file that lawsuit, even  though the Constitution makes clear it should be, it has to be,  originally in our Court and no other.  So, the State of Texas, by and through its attorney general, filed  this action. But they start by filing a motion for leave to file bill  of complaint. So, that is what they filed. They go through the motions  of doing what is required. Then, we get to the page that says ``Motion  for Leave to File Bill of Complaint,'' and it sets out--I am not going  to read the whole thing, but I think it is important that people  understand exactly what is involved here.  ``As set forth in the accompanying brief and complaint, the 2020  election suffered from significant and unconstitutional irregularities  in the defendant States:  ``Nonlegislative actors' purported amendments to States' duly enacted  election laws, in violation of the Electors Clause's vesting State  legislatures with plenary authority regarding the appointment of  Presidential electors.''  In other words, the Constitution makes clear the State legislatures  shall determine the appointment of the electors for that State as part  of the electoral college and nobody else. Not a judge, not a State or  Federal judge, not a commissioner, not a secretary of state, not a  Governor, but the legislature has to make that call of the State.  ``Intrastate differences in the treatment of voters, with more  favorable allotted to voters--whether lawful or unlawful--in areas  administered by local government under Democrat control and with  populations with higher ratios of Democrat voters than other areas of  defendant States.  ``The appearance of voting irregularities in the defendant States  that would be consistent with the unconstitutional relaxation of  ballot-integrity protections in those States' election laws.''  Those are three points made as to why this election suffered from  unconstitutional irregularities in those States that have been sued.  All of these flaws, even the violations of State election law,  violate one or more of the Federal requirements for elections. That  includes equal protection, due process, the Electors Clause, and thus  arise under Federal law.  So, it is not just that the Supreme Court, under our Constitution,  clearly has the original jurisdiction over this suit where a State sues  another State or States, but this involves a Federal question. In case  some on the Supreme Court are asleep or do not understand their  obligation, it is a Federal question as well as being a State versus  State.  In Bush v. Gore in 2000, the Court said: ``Significant departure from  the legislative scheme for appointing Presidential electors presents a  Federal constitutional question.''  The plaintiff, the State of Texas, ``respectfully submits that the  foregoing types of electoral irregularities exceed the hanging-chad  saga of the 2000 election in their degree of departure from both State  and Federal law. Moreover, these flaws cumulatively preclude knowing  who legitimately won the 2020 election and threaten to cloud all future  elections.''  I hope the Supreme Court--well, I know some of the Justices will take  particular interest and give attention to that. This is for the future  of the Republic.  As Eric Metaxas points out in his book, quoting from Franklin, when  he was asked, what have you given us? after the Constitutional  Convention in 1787 in Philadelphia. He replied: A republic, Madam, if  you can keep it. [["", Page , H7143, ]  I think the title of Eric's book is ``If You Can Keep It.''  Well, the answer will be determined in this case. If the Supreme  Court refuses to take it up and do their job, then the answer is, we  kept it from 1789 until 2020. Then, because we had people in States  that didn't do their job, or overzealously became partisan and allowed  circumstances, even participating in circumstances, to permit fraud and  to destroy the election process.  Any Republican that thinks, ``Oh, well, if I sound good, and I don't  stand up for the Constitution here, then I will be in good stead to be  the Republican nominee. Then, I can win the Presidency in 2024,'' the  news for those people is, if this fraud in this election is not  addressed and these unconstitutional schemes are not struck down by the  highest court in the country, there is not going to be a Republican  elected again. It is not going to happen.  So, it is rather important. History will judge us accordingly. From  the looks of what the Supreme Court did to Congressman Kelly's case, in  refusing to take it up, there is grave concern, appropriately, that the  Supreme Court is not going to do their jobs, that they will choose to  go down in history as the Supreme Court that allowed this Nation to  lapse as a republic.  There were rumors that the Chief Justice flipped his vote in the  ObamaCare case because he became very sensitive to the allegation that  if ObamaCare was overturned, he would become the most political Chief  Justice since Taney in the Dred Scott case. The rumor was that he  flipped and chose to uphold that decision, making him the most  political Chief Justice in American history, probably more so than  Taney.  In Taney's case--regardless of how you pronounce it--in that case,  that decision helped pave the way for the Civil War because the Supreme  Court did not do their job in protecting the rights listed in the  Constitution in the Bill of Rights. Likewise, this country is headed  for some very dire times if the Supreme Court doesn't resolve this  controversy and the fraud that underlies it.  Again, for those that say there was no fraud, wake up, look at the  evidence. There is sworn testimony. There is video footage.  Another thing that people need to understand about the judicial  system, it is not a new idea that one party to a suit would have  possession of evidence that would show that party should lose the  lawsuit. That has happened throughout jurisprudence.  Over the years, in the common law, a doctrine, a legal doctrine,  developed called spoliation. The doctrine is basically this: If one  party is in possession of evidence, or possesses the capacity to  preserve evidence, and they mix that evidence in with other evidence  that prevents a party from being able to show that it should win the  day, then that doctrine of spoliation can be utilized.  If there is a jury which is the fact-finder, the judge can tell the  jury that it may consider the fact that the defendant in this case had  possession of documents that would either prove or disprove the  plaintiff's case, and since the defendant refuses to produce them or  put them in a manner that they could not be identified or destroyed  them, then you may consider that that evidence supported the  plaintiff's case.  {time} 1330  And you can even take judicial notice, a court can, of a situation  like that. The Supreme Court could take judicial notice of that, that  one party has the evidence that will prove the plaintiff's case, and  they refuse to allow it to be found; or, as we saw in Pennsylvania, we  had a Supreme Court order to preserve evidence, and the eight actors in  Pennsylvania basically ignored the order so they could continue to hide  evidence. That should be evidence and should have judicial notice taken  that that evidence is the fact that they continue to hide what would  have proved the plaintiff's case.  So, as the brief says, taken together, these flaws affect outcome  determinative numbers of popular votes in a group of States that cast  outcome determinative numbers of electoral votes. This Court--and I am  talking about the Supreme Court since they have original jurisdiction-- should grant leave to file the complaint and ultimately enjoin the use  of unlawful election results without review and ratification by the  defendant States' legislatures and remand the defendant States'  respective legislatures to appoint Presidential electors in a manner  consistent with Electors Clause, and pursuant to 3 U.S.C. section 2.  So that is the motion for leave to file.  And then we get to the bill of complaint that Texas is seeking to  have permission to file.  Oh, please, oh, most holy Supreme Court, please, lower yourselves to  allow us to be heard before your Court of original jurisdiction.  Please, oh, please.  How many times do we need to say it to affect the high and mighty  Supreme Court?  Well, the bill of complaint actually has an appropriate quote from  John Adams: ``That form of government, which is best contrived to  secure an impartial and exact execution of the laws, is the best of  republics.'' And that is exactly what we will be losing if we do not  preserve the integrity of this election.  The bill of complaint goes on to say: ``Our country stands at an  important crossroads. Either the Constitution matters and must be  followed, even when some officials consider it inconvenient or out of  date, or it is simply a piece of parchment on display at the National  Archives. We ask the Court to choose the former.  ``Lawful elections are at the heart of our constitutional democracy.  The public, and indeed the candidates themselves, have a compelling  interest in ensuring that the selection of a President--any President-- is legitimate. If that trust is lost, the American Experiment will  founder. A dark cloud hangs over the 2020 Presidential election.  ``Here is what we know. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a  justification, government officials in the defendant States of Georgia,  Michigan, and Wisconsin, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . . .  usurped their legislatures' authority and unconstitutionally revised  their State's election statutes. They accomplished these statutory  revisions through executive fiat or friendly lawsuits, thereby  weakening ballot integrity. Finally, these same government officials  flooded the defendant States with millions of ballots to be sent  through the mails, or placed in drop boxes, with little or no chain of  custody and, at the same time, weakened the strongest security measures  protecting the integrity of the vote--signature verification and  witness requirements.''  And I might inject here, in the State of Georgia, on Saturday night,  being there with the President, David Perdue, Kelly Loeffler, and so  many other wonderful Georgia officials--and I do love the State of  Georgia. It seemed like I spent 20 years there because I was in the  Army, but my 4 years at Fort Benning, I grew to love the people of  Georgia. We still have many great friends in the State, so it is always  a pleasure to have an excuse to go back to Georgia.  That was a rough time in our history. People did not appreciate those  of us that wore the uniform. We didn't have it as bad as those who had  recently come back from Vietnam, but it was a very unpleasant time to  be in uniform. There were times when we were ordered not to wear it;  yet, generally, the people of Georgia were just superb.  I was there and Vernon Jones showed me an envelope he had gotten from  America Votes, sometimes referred to as Stacey Abrams' group, but it  had a return address on the envelope here in Washington, D.C., and  apparently they sent out millions of these requests for absentee  ballots.  It seemed like something like that ought to be reserved to a  governmental entity so that those are not sent to people who shouldn't  be getting them, that government ought to update their records and make  sure they are not sending them to dead people or to people who have  been moved to other States, other jurisdictions for 40 years, as we  have already heard in some cases.  There was all this information about absentee ballots and pushing the  recipient to fill it out, send it in, and even a postage-paid envelope  was provided, which provides something of value to somebody for them to  send in that absentee request. [["", Page , H7144, ]  But I just thought: Wow. So Washington, D.C., has gotten involved in  the State of Georgia's election in trying to skew the vote there. It is  really interesting.  But getting back to this complaint by the State of Texas, it says:  ``The only date that is mandated under the Constitution is . . .  January 20, 2021, U.S. Constitution Amendment 20.  ``Against that background, the State of Texas . . . brings this  action against defendant States based on the following allegations:  ``1. Plaintiff State challenges defendant States' administration of  the 2020 election under the Electors Clause of Article II, Section 1,  Clause 2, and the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.  ``2. This case presents a question of law: Did defendant States  violate the Electors Clause, or, in the alternative, the 14th  Amendment, by taking--or allowing--nonlegislative actions to change the  election rules that would govern the appointment of Presidential  electors?  ``3. Those unconstitutional changes opened the door to election  irregularities in various forms. Plaintiff State alleges that each of  the defendant States flagrantly violated constitutional rules governing  the appointment of Presidential electors. In doing so, seeds of deep  distrust have been sown across the country. In the spirit of Marbury v.  Madison, this Court's attention is profoundly needed to declare what  the law is and to restore public trust in this election.  ``4. As Justice Gorsuch observed recently: ``Government is not free  to disregard the Constitution in times of crisis. . . . Yet, recently,  during the COVID pandemic, certain States seem to have ignored these  long-settled principles.''  That is in the case of Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, New York  v. Cuomo, a case from 2020. The petition or the complaint says that  this case is no different now.  ``5. Each of the defendant States acted in a common pattern. State  officials, sometimes through pending litigation, for example, settling  `friendly' suits, and sometimes unilaterally by executive fiat,  announced new rules for the conduct of the 2020 election that were  inconsistent with existing State statutes defining what constitutes a  lawful vote.  ``6. Defendant States also failed to segregate ballots in a manner  that would permit accurate analysis to determine which ballots were  cast in conformity with the legislative set rules and which were not.  This is especially true of the mail-in ballots in these States by  waiving, lowering, and otherwise failing to following the State  statutory requirements for signature validation and other processes for  ballot security, the entire body of such ballots is now  constitutionally suspect and may not be legitimately used to determine  allocation of the defendant States' Presidential electors.''  I interject here. A good example, and this also brings in the  doctrine of spoliation, where, in Georgia, you had people lie to get  people out of the area in which ballots were being counted, and then  once they were all out and there was no big water leak, there may have  been a slight leak in a commode, but they were moved out. You can see  the video. But then out from under tables comes suitcases full of  ballots that these people who are unwatched to ensure that these were  legitimate ballots, they started running them through and counting  them.  Well, my understanding is they have refused to make those ballots  available for examination. And that is where spoliation comes in. They  have got the evidence; they refuse to produce it; so the presumption  should be made by the Supreme Court, if those ballots were produced by  the people who have sole control over them, they would prove the  plaintiff's case; therefore, plaintiff's case is proven and the results  are no longer viable and valid.  The complaint goes on: ``Each of the defendant States acted in a  common pattern.''  I touched on that.  ``7. The rampant lawlessness arising out of defendant States'  unconstitutional acts is described in a number of currently pending  lawsuits in defendant States or in public view including:  ``Dozens of witnesses testifying under oath about the physical  blocking and kicking out of Republican poll challengers; thousands of  the same ballots run multiple times through tabulators; mysterious late  night dumps of thousands of ballots at tabulation centers; illegally  backdating thousands of ballots; signature verification procedures  ignored''--and I would interject, and those put in batches where it  could not be determined what signatures came with that ballot. That  ought to lead to spoliation evidence--``signature verification  procedures ignored; more than 173,000 ballots in the Wayne County,  Michigan, center that cannot be tied to a registered voter;  ``Videos of: poll workers erupting in cheers as poll challengers are  removed from vote-counting centers; poll watchers being blocked from  entering vote-counting centers--despite even having a court order to  enter; suitcases full of ballots being pulled out from underneath  tables after poll watchers were told to leave.  {time} 1345  ``Facts for which no independently verified reasonable explanation  exists: On October 1, 2020, in Pennsylvania, a laptop and several USB  drives used to program Pennsylvania's Dominion voting machines were  mysteriously stolen from a warehouse in Philadelphia. The laptop and  the USB drives were the only items taken, and potentially could be  taken to alter vote tallies; in Michigan, which also employed the same  Dominion voting system, on November 4, 2020, Michigan election  officials have admitted that a purported `glitch' caused 6,000 votes  for President Trump to be wrongly switched to Democratic candidate  Biden. A flash drive containing tens of thousands of votes was left  unattended in the Milwaukee tabulations center in the early morning  hours of November 4, 2020, without anyone aware it was not in a proper  chain of custody.  ``8. Nor was this court''--talking about the Supreme Court--``immune  from the blatant disregard for the rule of law. Pennsylvania itself  played fast and loose with its promise to this court. In a classic bait  and switch, Pennsylvania used guidance from its Secretary of State to  argue that this Court should not expedite review because the State  would segregate potentially unlawful ballots. A court of law would  reasonably rely on such a representation. Remarkably, before the ink  was dry on the court's 4-4 decision, Pennsylvania changed that  guidance, breaking the State's promise to the Supreme Court.''  In the October 28, 2020, decision, it said: ``We have been informed  by the Pennsylvania Attorney General that the Secretary of the  Commonwealth issued guidance today directing county boards of elections  to segregate late-arriving ballots.''  Well, it turns out they lied to the Supreme Court. And if the Supreme  Court will not have at least enough self-respect to call down a State  that lies to the Court to get a ruling they want, then that is one  worthless court.  It is the same problem we have had with the FISA courts and why I  want to eliminate them. They didn't even have enough self-respect that  when they found out they were lied to in a number of manners in order  to get a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, they didn't get upset.  They didn't put anybody in jail. They didn't hold anybody in contempt.  A court that worthless needs to be eliminated.  As my law school professor, David Gwynne, used to say, you know,  every Federal court in America, except for one, owes its existence and  jurisdiction to the U.S. Congress. That, of course, the Supreme Court.  We brought them into the world, we should be able to take them out. And  that should happen when they don't even have enough self-respect to  enforce the truthfulness required to make that court operate.  In Republican Party versus Boockvar, November 6, 2020, a quote from  that decision: ``This court was not informed that the guidance issued  on October 28th, which had an important bearing on the question whether  to order special treatment of the ballots in question, had been  modified.''  That was from Justice Alito.  ``10. The probability of former Vice President Biden winning the  popular vote in the four defendant states--Georgia, Michigan,  Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin--independently given President Trump's  early lead in those States as of 3 a.m. on November 4, is less than [["", Page , H7145, ] one in a quadrillion, or one in''--well, I am not even sure what that  number is. Maybe quadrillion. I guess that is 15 zeros. ``For former  Vice President Biden to win these four states collectively, the odds of  that event happening decreased to less than one in a quadrillion to the  fourth power.  ``13. By purporting to waive or otherwise modify the existing State  law in a manner that was wholly ultra vires and not adopted by each  State's legislature, defendant States violated not only the electors  clause, but also the elections clause, to the extent that the Article I  elections clause textually applies to the Article II process of  selecting Presidential electors.  ``14. Plaintiff States and their voters are entitled to a  Presidential election in which the votes from each of the States are  counted only if the ballots are cast and counted in a manner that  complies with the preexisting laws of each State. The President and  vice president of the United States are the only elected officials who  represent all the voters in the Nation. Voters who cast lawful ballots  cannot have their votes diminished''--or the term we have heard over  the last 4 years, disenfranchised--``by States that administered their  2020 Presidential elections in a manner where it is impossible to  distinguish a lawful ballot from an unlawful ballot.  ``15. The number of absentee and mail-in ballots that have been  handled unconstitutionally in defendant States greatly exceeds the  difference between the vote totals of the two candidates for President  of the United States in each defendant State.  ``16. In addition to injunctive relief for this election, plaintiff  State seeks declaratory relief for all Presidential elections in the  future. This problem is clearly capable of repetition, yet evading  review. The integrity of our constitutional democracy requires that  States conduct Presidential elections in accordance with the rule of  law and Federal constitutional guarantees.  So that is critical.  ``18. In a Presidential election, `the impact of the votes cast in  each State is affected by the votes cast for the various candidates in  other States.'''  That is in the Anderson case, 460 U.S. at 795.  ``The constitutional failures of defendant States injure plaintiff  States because `the right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or  dilution of the weight of a citizen's vote just as effectively as by  wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.'''  And that is from Bush versus Gore.  In any event, Mr. Speaker, it is critical that the Supreme Court step  up and take the jurisdiction that the Constitution requires it to take.  It won't be fun and it won't be pleasurable, but it is absolutely  essential that the U.S. Supreme Court do what the Constitution created  them to do, take up this matter with which it has original jurisdiction  and determine there were unconstitutional actions taken that affected  the outcome of this election. It was not a free and fair election, and  if the Supreme Court does not act accordingly, then, really, the  Supreme Court is irrelevant, Congress is irrelevant; and those who  would seek to hide ballots in the future, create improper ballots,  count ballots multiple times, they will control the future of this  country, not the Supreme Court, not Congress, but a newfangled  electronic--not just electronic. They used every method known to man.  It will make Tammany Hall, and has made Tammany Hall, look like Mister  Rogers' Neighborhood. It is time to act. It is time preserve the  Republic.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "

Madam Speaker, I thank the subcommittee chairwoman for her strong  support on this issue. This is the second year in a row that the  chairwoman and her committee and the committee staff have supported an  increase like this for inpatient facilities for veterans who are  struggling with mental health [["", Page , H3712, ] or substance use issues and need treatment, and I appreciate their  advocacy very much.

On the other side, you have the  hardworking men and women of the U.S. Postal Service.  The President and the Postmaster General say there is nothing to see  here. Nothing to see. They tell us that their operational changes are  meant to help the Postal Service.  The Postal Service workers, whose job it is to deliver the mail day  in and day out, are saying something different. They are telling us  that they are falling behind on processing packages because of these  operational changes. As a result, they are seeing [["", Page , H4281, ] bugs and rodents swimming around containers of rotten food and meat and  animals.  Now, my Republican colleagues say that this is a conspiracy theory.  But I say to them: You can't smell a conspiracy theory. There are dying  animals, rotten food, rotten meat, rats, flies.  You can't see that in a conspiracy theory. I want them to open their  eyes because their constituents, my constituents, are suffering because  of this deliberate attempt to sabotage the U.S. Postal Service. Their  constituents--seniors and veterans who depend on fast delivery of their  medicines, the small businesses that depend on the U.S. Postal Service  to stay afloat, and every American who wants to partake in our  democracy safely during this pandemic.  Mr. Speaker, I can tell you which side I believe: the employees of  the U.S. Postal Service. It is with them in mind that I strongly  support the passage of "", H.R. 8015, "", the Delivering for America Act.    "

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of ', S. 2174, ', the Missing Persons and Unidentified Remains Act, which gives  local law enforcement the tools they need to address a devastating  issue that is draining resources in rural communities in south Texas  and across the southwest border.  Border communities are currently shouldering the cost of identifying  and recovering the remains of migrants who tragically perished while  migrating to the United States. This affects our citizens, ranchers,  and farmers.  The Missing Persons and Unidentified Remains Act is a bipartisan,  bicameral effort that will give local law [[', Page , H7219, ] enforcement access to Federal dollars and will help free up local  resources for rural healthcare, education, broadband, and other key  services that are, tragically, needed in these areas.  This is a critical bill to help address issues that are symptomatic  of a larger problem. Unless we invest time and resources to address the  root cause of migration from Central America, we will continue to  witness these tragic deaths in our border region.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Brooks County Sheriff Benny Martinez, Jim Hogg  County Sheriff Erasmo Alarcon, Jr., and Duval County Sheriff Romeo  Ramirez, to name a few. These men have been on the front lines of this  issue and continue their work to identify who has died.  I also acknowledge the Southern Border Communities Coalition, the  Church World Services, and the Texas Civil Rights Project for their  work to raise awareness about this issue and help build support for  this bill. Without the support of this large cross section of  stakeholders, we would not be here passing this legislation today.  For the families that have lost their loved ones, this bill is an  opportunity to bring closure. I know many of you may not find the  answers you seek, but there is a much better chance because of this  legislation.  Mr. Speaker, in recognition of the bipartisan support for this bill,  I request that all my colleagues vote in support of this important  effort.    "

To my colleague, Ms. Kaptur from Ohio, thank you for your friendship  and support.

As an Oklahoman, although we cannot claim Neil Armstrong but can  claim a rich heritage in the aerospace arena and have astronauts at  every phase of the Apollo program, I can think of no more appropriate  recognition of Neil Armstrong than to name this facility after him.

183,Paul Gosar,0.948354184627533,R,gosar,gosar," Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), my friend, for organizing this Special Order  and for his leadership and expertise on forestry issues.  The events of the last month and the last decade plus show how poorly  our current forest management policies are and that they are broken and  in drastic need of reform.  Nearly every corner of the West has been touched by catastrophic  wildfire. My district has been home to several major fires this year,  including the Bush fire that burned over 193,000 acres. 700,000 acres  of land has been burned across my State.  Even before this year's fire season, the evidence of our forest  management practices being broken are clear. In the last 10 years  alone, wildfires have burned over 74 million acres of land in the West,  and our Federal Government's reaction to this has been extremely  lacking.  These catastrophic fires have devastating impacts on the environment  and human health. For example, one large wildfire is roughly the  equivalent of a major volcanic eruption, releasing large amounts of  dangerous particles into the air. This increase of air pollution  exacerbates respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19.  Because of this, earlier this year, I wrote a letter to Agriculture  Secretary Perdue and Interior Secretary Bernhardt. This letter urged  them to act quickly to secure contracts with private businesses to  ensure that firefighters could be properly protected from COVID-19 and  that the aerial support they needed to adequately fight catastrophic  fires was there.  Recent studies conducted at George Mason University showed that on  average, a fire stands a higher probability of being contained within  24 hours if air tankers are deployed on that fire within the first few  hours. Fires that do not receive air tanker support for a period of 13  hours or more are likely to take days or weeks to achieve containment.  I also wrote a letter to Attorney General Barr that urged him to  ensure that the Justice Department's Natural Resources Division was  adequately resourced to fight frivolous lawsuits from radical leftwing  environmental organizations.  Lawsuits from radical environmentalists are nothing new. We have seen  this already in Arizona with the disastrous WildEarth Guardians lawsuit  regarding the Mexican Spotted Owl. In that case, a U.S. District Court  judge in Tucson issued a ruling based on bad and debunked science that  stopped active forest management activities in six national forests,  including the Tonto National Forest in Arizona, which was the home of  the Bush fire.  This decision was a massive setback, and it is directly contributing  to the enhanced fire risk that threatens our communities that we are  seeing across the West.  A devastating wildfire season is not inevitable. It isn't something  that we must just accept. There are steps that can be taken now to  ensure that our communities are protected. [["", Page , H5635, ]  I will continue to urge the Federal agencies tasked with managing our  forests and fighting catastrophic fires that bold action is necessary.  Lives depend on it.  Just last year, as chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus, I  had the opportunity to visit the district of my friend from California,  Mr. McClintock, where aggressive forest management practices in the  Lake Tahoe Basin have prevented catastrophic fire. This active  management was made possible by getting unnecessary red tape out of the  way and putting what is most important first: protecting our  communities from the destruction of wildfire.  Just in the last 2 years, this administration has taken steps to  manage vegetation inside utility corridors, build additional  firebreaks, and reform the NEPA process within the Forest Service.  However, after so many years of inaction, there is a long road to hoe  to where we have to get, which is why I am so pleased we are here  tonight calling for serious action by this House.  There are a few pieces of legislation that have been introduced. Just  to name a few: ', H.R. 7978, ', a bipartisan, comprehensive forestry reform  bill led by the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa), as well as  ', H.R. 2607, "", the Resilient Federal Forests Act, by Mr. Westerman, both of  which I am proud to support.  The Democratic leadership in this House has been transparent about  the fact that they do not view forest management to prevent wildfires  as a legislative priority, and that has deadly consequences.  Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Arkansas for holding this  Special Order and for his leadership and expertise on this issue.    "
184,Josh Gottheimer,0.8726993799209595,D,gottheimer,gottheimer," Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, they said it couldn't be done, that  Democrats and Republicans could actually come together, not only in the  House, but in the Senate, too, and pass a COVID-19 emergency relief  package. But, finally, after 9 months, it is about to happen. We are  about to cross the finish line. This is as close to a Christmas miracle  as you can find in a normally polarized Washington.  {time} 1700  With the virus raging across the Nation, the 50-Member strong  bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus put country over party and helped  craft a package that will help put food on the table, distribute  vaccines to our communities, save our struggling small businesses, put  money in the pockets of American families, and help keep families in  their homes.  This emergency relief package wouldn't have happened without the  weeks of hard work from the Problem Solvers Caucus and a bipartisan  group of Senators who put country ahead of party to help our families,  small businesses, and communities. This was truly a model for how we  should govern in Washington.  This marks a critical downpayment in our ongoing fight against COVID.  If you look in New Jersey, where 1 in 500 have lost their lives, and 30  percent of small businesses are out, we clearly have more work to do.  Madam Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan, bicameral  legislation, which is a critical step forward.    "

For 24 years, he served on the school board, including 17 years as  chairman. Johnny also served as vice mayor of his hometown.  He and Linda, his charming wife of 56 years, have three children-- Ross, Lora, and Jeremy--and seven grandchildren.  On behalf of the United States Congress, I am proud to congratulate  Johnny Blakely on his retirement and express our gratitude for his 18  years of service to Tennessee's Seventh District.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the decades-long service of a  public servant who embodies what makes Tennessee the Volunteer State,  Mr. Johnny Blakely.  After 18 years faithfully representing the member of Congress for  Tennessee's Seventh District, Johnny will begin his next chapter of  life in the new year.  Johnny grew up in McNairy County in west Tennessee, where his mother  diligently raised a family of five while also working in the local shoe  factory. After a thirty-five year career at [["", Page , H7026, ] AT&T, he joined then-Congressman Marsha Blackburn's office. When I was  elected to Congress, he agreed to postpone retirement to continue  serving our district for two more years.  Johnny has been the invaluable link between the work we do in  congress and the local communities in the district by being a resource  for constituents and community leaders and listening to the concerns  and challenges facing rural Tennesseans.  Johnny understands the challenges of our community leaders because he  himself has been one throughout his life. For 24 years, he served on  the McNairy County Board of Education, including 17 years as chairman.  During this time, the Board of Education oversaw two multi-million- dollar building projects in the county. In 1992, he was selected to  serve on the All Tennessee School Board. Johnny also served as Vice  Mayor of his beloved hometown, Ramer.  Johnny and Linda, his ceaselessly charming wife of 56 years, have  three children--Ross, Lora, and Jeremy--and seven grandchildren. Johnny  has always sought to put his family first and he is proud of everything  that his children and grandchildren have accomplished. He and his  family are longtime members of Ramer Baptist Church, where he has  served many years as an Ordained Deacon, Music Director, and Sunday  School Teacher.  Johnny has done an outstanding job serving the people of Tennessee  and this nation through his volunteer work and his professional career  of public service, and it has been an honor and a privilege to have him  as a member of my staff.  On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I'm proud to  congratulate Johnny Blakely on his retirement and to express our  gratitude for his lifelong commitment to his community and his 18 years  of faithful and diligent service to the people of Tennessee's Seventh  Congressional District.

202,Raul Grijalva,3.156712293624878,D,grijalva,grijalva," Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to  give me an opportunity to speak on behalf of ', H.R. 2420, "", legislation  introduced by our esteemed friend and colleague, the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Serrano), a pioneer and a powerful advocate for Latino people  in his time in this Congress. And the whole Nation, all Americans have  benefited from his work, and we are all grateful for what he has done  for many people in this country.  I have a brief story. You will hear a lot about the statistical  importance and the history that needs to be told, but I have a brief  story. You know, I am a first-generation American citizen. My parents  migrated and immigrated into this country with the distinct goal of  giving their kids a chance. And to that end, they did. But, see, my  story is not unique, nor is it, for that matter, extraordinary. It is  the story that binds all the diversity of Latinos together, a shared  experience and a shared demand for respect, fairness, and to be treated  as equals.  The Latino Museum, this vote, comes at a time of forced divisions in  this country, attempts to demonize and marginalize Latinos by the  highest voice in this land. Our American history and identity are also  Latino history and identity and, through this history, the United  States exists.  Latino history, like American history, is ongoing, it is evolving,  but to tell the full stories, the scars, the current wounds, the  changes, the unsung leaders in all arenas, with that story also comes  hope. And today and tomorrow, as we honor our great friend and leader  and beacon, John Lewis, here at the Capitol, for being the person that  he was, and a great American--you know, my proudest moment and  privilege was to be arrested with him in a civil disobedience protest  on behalf of immigrants, DACA recipients, and their families.  So today, we are voting for 2420, and we are saying ``yes'' to the  Latino Museum, but I think, more importantly, this ``yes'' vote by  Congress is also a vote that extends respect, provides acknowledgment,  provides equity, and begins to tell the story of all Americans in this  country.  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation.  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd), my good friend, a gentleman who has  been leading on Latino issues in our Republican Conference, and someone  who bravely served our country in the CIA, but also, will be greatly  missed in this institution.    "
203,Glenn Grothman,0.17097033560276031,R,grothman,grothman," Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, as I look around the room here, it looks  like I am in the U.S. Congress. I mean, I see the American flag there;  George Washington is over there; it says ``In God We Trust.'' But  looking at this bill [["", Page , H9156, ] today, it makes me feel like we are in the Parliament of Afghanistan,  Burundi, Yemen, or Bolivia.  Do we really think the way to improve the quality of life for  Americans is to just print more money from the Fed? If you look around,  we are going to be printing another $400 billion.  Has anybody looked lately at what is going on with the monetary  supply? M1 up 50 percent; M2 up 20 percent.  Don't people realize that just printing more is not a way to make our  citizens wealthier; it is just a way to debase the currency?  The way for a wealthy country is to work hard through frugality and  through improving one's skills, not by having the Fed print money.  Last time, when we sent out $1,200 checks, I stopped by my local  Walmart, and the people in charge of the electronics section said they  had never seen such sales in their life.  Is that really going to improve the lot of Americans, to go over and  buy some more electronic junk from China? Apparently so.  And let's not forget when we look at inflation. We have inflation  right now. Twice, in the recent past, we have changed the definition on  what inflation is.  So we do have inflation; it is just that we keep changing the  definition to mask it. That is why the market is up. The market is up  because we really do have inflation.  We are in the U.S. Congress. We should not think the way to  prosperity is just printing money. We should act like we are the United  States. That is why, for my whole life, other countries like to invest  in the dollar. They respect the value of the dollar more than the  national currencies of Burundi, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Bolivia. Those  are four poor countries; that is why I picked them out.  So I encourage Senator McConnell to hold the line here, to act  responsibly.    "
204,Michael Guest,1.0236207246780396,R,guest,guest," Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, since the outbreak of the coronavirus in the  United States, the promise of the development of a vaccine has allowed  Americans to remain optimistic in the midst of tragedy. Now, after  months of sacrifice, the coronavirus vaccine has been found. This  accomplishment would not have been possible without the hard work of  scientists working around the world and the support by the tremendous  feat of government innovation known as Operation Warp Speed.  Now, following the discovery of the vaccine, we must focus on the  production and distribution of the vaccine to the American people and  to those across the globe.  Public officials are optimistic that distribution of the vaccine  could begin in a matter of weeks, a massive jump forward in the process  to rid the world of this dangerous virus. This production of millions  of dosages of vaccine will not happen overnight, but thanks to  Operation Warp Speed and the Trump administration, the vaccine will  reach vulnerable Americans faster than anticipated, saving thousands of  lives in the process.  Mr. Speaker, I thank all who helped advance this extraordinary  accomplishment.    "
205,Brett Guthrie,1.1783215999603271,R,guthrie,guthrie," Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support today of my bill (', H.R. 5758, ""), the Ceiling Fan Improvement Act.  In January 2017, the Department of Energy finalized energy  conservation standards for ceiling fans that, unfortunately, did not  account for the different airflow dynamics of large ceiling fans.  Under the current regulations, some of the most efficient large- diameter fans would have to be taken off the market in the U.S.  The Ceiling Fan Improvement Act is a bipartisan, commonsense bill  that will ensure large-diameter fans are properly regulated. Technical  innovation and new products will be key to improving energy efficiency  and protecting our environment for generations to come, and the Ceiling  Fan Improvement Act seeks to ensure that high-performing, large- diameter ceiling fans can remain on the market and help achieve real  energy savings.  I thank Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky for working with me on this  bill. I appreciate all the efforts she made to work with me and work  together. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. Speaker, while on the floor, I want to make some comments about  some of our colleagues who are leaving.  Mr. Speaker, first, we are hallway roommates in the Rayburn Office  Building. I will miss seeing you. Congratulations on where you are  going. You are retiring. It has been a pleasure. Your staff is  fantastic. Every time I walk by and pop my head in and say hello to  them, they are always very gracious. So we are going to miss you guys.  Elected with me in 2008--Pete Olson was just recognized on the floor;  farewell to him--when we first got elected to Congress, we were  together in a new Member orientation. We were chatting with each other,  and I think he said that he was born in Fort Lewis, Washington. We know  he is Texas through and through, but he also had a sojourn in Alabama.  We were talking, and I said: I was born in Alabama.  And he said: Well, I used to live in Alabama.  I said: I was born in Florence, Alabama.  Some of you may know Muscle Shoals is where some of the world's  greatest music is from. That is where I was from.  He said: Well, I lived in Florence for a year.  I said: I lived in the Forest Hills neighborhood.  He said: I lived in the Forest Hills neighborhood. Did you ever know  a Mr. McCugh?  I said: He was the kind of dad who was involved in everybody's lives.  Yes, he was my Little League coach.  He said: He was my Little League coach.  I looked at him, and I said: You are little Petey Olson?  So Pete Olson and I come together to Congress in 2008 and found out  we knew each other when we were kids. His dad worked for Champion, a  big paper mill that went on to Houston.  I would also like to say that the Houston Oilers now play 1 hour from  my home in Nashville. So we are proud to have them. I hope he still  cheers for them in Nashville.  But what was interesting is we just said he is a year older, and I  have never said this on the floor, but I would like to say this now: He  is a year older than I, as his birthday is today. We had the same  second grade teacher.  He said: Did you have Mrs. LeCates?  I said: I had Mrs. LeCates.  The story about Mrs. LeCates is that from the time summer was out  that Pete Olson left and before school commenced that I went into  second grade with Mrs. LeCates, something momentous that summer  happened in her life. Her son, Second Lieutenant Robert LeCates, was  killed in Vietnam. It is really the only name I personally know on the  wall when I go. You have heard of people and you have different names  you know and you hear stories about, but he is the only person I had a  personal connection to. So every time I go to the wall, I have told him  that. I said: Every time I go to the wall, I look at Robert LeCates,  and I look at his name.  It reminds me to this day that there are people who sacrifice their  lives for us to be here and for us to do what we are doing, and we need  to conduct ourselves worthy of people who gave the ultimate sacrifice  for that. So that was our story.  But I just want to close with talking about our former chairman and  ranking member, Greg Walden, and wish him well in his retirement. He  is outstanding to work with, just outstanding to work with. No matter  what the subcommittee, he knew the policy, he knew what was going on,  and he had his handle on it. But he also let us go out and do our work  and then bring issues to him and move forward with him as well,  particularly on the SUPPORT Act. That is the opioid epidemic [["", Page , H7076, ] bill, trying to address that. It has been a plague on my State like it  has been on so many others.  He really gave people freedom to bring the best ideas and put all the  best ideas together with both sides. He could always compromise without  compromising his values and his principles. He said: If there is a way  for both sides to win, let's find a way for both sides to win.  Mr. Speaker, I know the gentleman has yielded me as much time as I  may consume. If I consumed everything to say what is good about you and  the value you are to this institution, I would be here all afternoon  because you have really made an impact on this institution. You have  made an impact upon our conference.  I think people on both sides of the aisle have said your service here  has made a difference, not for Congress, but through your service in  Congress and for the country, and I thank you for that. We are going to  miss you, and I wish you Godspeed as you move forward.  {time} 1400    "
206,Debra Haaland,1.2714295387268066,D,haaland,haaland," Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Speaker, as one of the first Native American women  elected to Congress and the daughter of two veterans, I am proud that  my bill with Representative Mike Gallagher, the Department of  Veterans Affairs Tribal Advisory Committee Act, will be included in  this package. [["", Page , H7211, ]  All veterans deserve the best care that our country can give, but  there are gaps in services for Native American veterans.  The advisory committee established by this bill will ensure that we  look at and remedy the specific barriers Native American veterans face  so they will have access to the same care that other veterans have.  For these reasons and many more, I am thankful for the inclusion of  my bill today and look forward to seeing its implementation by  President-elect Biden.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman from California  (Mr. Takano) has expired.  Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers, and I am prepared to close.  Mr. Speaker, it is obvious today, with the minority leader, the  Speaker, and numerous, numerous distinguished Members coming to speak,  the importance of this.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano for his work on this. I thank  all the Members who, in a bipartisan way, brought this extremely  important bill to fruition.  I certainly appreciate the honor of having this bill named after  Senator Isakson and myself, and I encourage my colleagues to support  this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
207,Jim Hagedorn,0.3385578691959381,R,hagedorn,hagedorn," Mr. HAGEDORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank ranking Republican Conaway for  yielding the time. I appreciate all that he has done for our committee  over the years serving as chairman and everything else.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Peterson for his service on behalf of  our farmers and agribusinesses. I appreciate him as well.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the U.S. Grain Standards  Reauthorization Act of 2020.  The U.S. Grain Standards Act of 1916 established USDA's Federal Grain  Inspection Service and has benefited all of agriculture, right down the  chain, for more than a century.  This reauthorization today will provide 5 years of certainty, avoid  potential disruptions to the grain inspection and weighing system, and  make modest but important changes to the program overall.  The folks at the Minnesota Grain & Feed Association and many others  in agriculture are behind this legislation. And let's not forget that  the bill additionally requires USDA to conduct comprehensive,  nationwide review of the agency geographic areas to report its findings  and recommendations and report back to Congress in 18 months.  I will vote ``yes'' today. I encourage all of my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to vote ``yes.''    "
208,Kwanza Hall,0.04970067739486694,D,hall,hall," Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, the first wave of stimulus spending proved  frustrating for a lot of small and medium sized business.  Many mom and pop businesses ran in to loan processing problems  because there were problems with their applications.  Many applicants did not know that their applications needed to be  cured from any defects or that there were defects with their  application.  Some other small businesses were rejected because their lender ran  out of allocation because the lenders were focused on larger loans.  That is why, Democrats were able to secure $325 billion in small  business aid this time around.  Democrats secured critical funding and policy changes to help small  businesses, including minority-owned businesses, and nonprofits recover  from the pandemic.  This deal includes over $284 billion for first and second forgivable  PPP loans, dedicated set-asides for very small businesses and lending  through community-based lenders like Community Development Financial  Institutions and Minority Depository Institutions, and expanded PPP  eligibility for 501(c)(6) nonprofits, including destination marketing  organizations, and local newspapers, TV and radio broadcasters. $20  billion is included for new EIDL Grants for businesses in low-income  communities, $3.5 billion for continued SBA debt relief payments, and  $2 billion for enhancements to SBA lending.  This deal also includes $15 billion in dedicated funding for live  venues, independent movie theaters, and cultural institutions.  Small businesses that took a PPP loan and saw their revenues fall by  25% will be eligible for a second loan.  Congress will also allow PPP borrowers to take tax deductions for  covered business expenses.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.  Pursuant to ', House Resolution 1271, ', the previous question is ordered.  The question of adoption of the motion is divided.  The first portion of the divided question is: Will the House concur  in the Senate amendment with the matter proposed to be inserted as  Divisions B, C, E, and F of the amendment of the House?  The question is on the first portion of the divided question.  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    "
209,Josh Harder,2.260977029800415,D,harder,harder," Mr. HARDER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a  long-overdue victory for our Vietnam veterans.  For decades, tens of thousands of Vietnam vets haven't got the  benefits that they deserve. Even though diseases like Parkinson's,  hyperthyroidism, and bladder cancer are scientifically linked to Agent  Orange, they still aren't covered by the VA.  But, today, I am thrilled to say that veterans exposed to Agent  Orange can finally stop fighting their own government because my bill,  the Fair Care for Veterans Act, is on track to become the law of the  land.  I want to dedicate this effort to Joshua Melendez of Modesto,  California, and Lyle Ducheneaux of Turlock, California, two local  veterans who will personally be impacted by this change.  Most of all, I want to dedicate this effort to my grandfather, First  Sergeant Albert Z. Simmons, whose life was cut tragically short by  Agent Orange. I wish he could be with us today to see this.  These veterans fought for us. It has been my honor to fight for them.  God [["", Page , H6849, ] bless you, and thank you for your service.    "
210,Josh Harder,2.260977029800415,D,harder,harder," Mr. HARDER. Madam  Speaker, I demand that the Senate take action with respect to the  Dream Act.    The online version has been corrected to read: (Mr. HARDER of  California asked and was given permission to address the House for  1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) (English  translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:) Mr.  HARDER of California. Madam Speaker, I demand that the Senate take  action with respect to the Dream Act.  ========================= END NOTE =========================   I was proud to vote this week to approve this law because it is time  to provide stability to the recipients of DACA.  The Dreamers are our friends and neighbors.  They are Americans in every sense of the word--except on paper.  I had the honor to be a professor at a college in my district,  Modesto Junior College.  One of my young students was studying to be a pharmacist.  But because her family had brought her here when she was only three  months old, her future is at stake.  Stories like hers are common, especially in my district, in the  Central Valley.  More than 10,000 young people are eligible to receive their  citizenship by the Dream Act.  Dreamers deserve this opportunity. It is time to pass the Dream Act.  Presidenta de la Camara de Representantes, exijo que el Senado tome  accion al respecto a la ``Dream Act''.  Con orgullo, esta semana vote para aprobar esta ley porque ya es  tiempo de darles seguridad a los recipientes de DACA.  Los Dreamers son nuestros amigos y vecinos.  Son americanos en todo el sentido de la palabra--menos en un papel.  Tuve el honor de ser un profesor en un colegio en mi distrito,  Modesto Junior College.  Una de mis estudiantes era una joven que estaba estudiando para ser  farmaceutica.  Pero como su familia la trajo a este pais cuando tenia solo tres  meses, su futuro esta en peligro.  Historias como la suya son comunes, especialmente en mi distrito en  el Valle Central de California.  Mas de diez mil jovenes son elegibles para recibir ciudadania con La  ``Dream Act.''  Los Dreamers merecen esta oportunidad. Es tiempo para pasar la  ``Dream Act.''  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Fletcher). The gentleman from  California will provide the Clerk a translation of his remarks.    "

213,Vicky Hartzler,1.0901732444763184,R,hartzler,hartzler," Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the long-term  care and nursing home workers of Missouri's Fourth District, who have  witnessed the devastating effects of the coronavirus pandemic on a  daily basis. These frontline healthcare workers cope with the deaths  and illnesses brought on by this virus and are witnesses to the  heartbreaking losses family members experience whose loved ones pass  away without benefit of that final embrace before saying good-bye.  For these noble and selfless individuals, the impact of COVID-19  isn't restricted to emotional wounds opened through witnessing the  suffering of others, but by the personal physical health risks posed by  being on the front lines to conduct their day-to-day activities.  These frontline workers in our nursing homes and long-term care  facilities are heroes who have chosen to possibly put themselves in  peril by answering the call. They have been a source of encouragement,  hope, and help to our Nation's greatest generation, a lifeline amidst a  challenging time.  On behalf of myself and the caring families of Missouri's Fourth  District, thank you. We appreciate you, and we pray God blesses you in  a very special way during this special season and throughout the year.    "
214,Alcee Hastings,0.2683836817741394,D,hastings,hastings," Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    "
215,Jahana Hayes,0.35171711444854736,D,hayes,hayes," Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of the 26  beautiful lives that were lost on December 14, 2012, at Sandy Hook  Elementary School.  Mr. Speaker, 8 years ago, 20 innocent children and six selfless  educators were murdered in what should have been the safest places in  their community: their school.  Today, I ask that we pause, reflect, remember, and recommit ourselves  to working to ensure that this never happens again.  For many residents of Newtown, Connecticut, 8 years feels like  yesterday. Time has stood still for so many families as they attempt to  rebuild their [[', Page , H7169, ] community and honor the precious memory of their children and  educators.  Mr. Speaker, much needs to be done to ensure that our schools and  communities are safe places. We owe it to the 26 families from Sandy  Hook to work together to make this happen. We owe it to the over 38,000  people who will die each year from gun violence to do better. We owe it  to the 50 million people who are affected by mental health challenges  each year. We owe it to ourselves, because we are capable of creating  change.  Mr. Speaker, today, we honor, remember, and reflect, and then we get  back to work.    "
216,Denny Heck,1.3417080640792847,D,heck,heck," Mr. HECK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on this floor for the  last time. My purpose is to convey two simple thoughts: first, an  expression of gratitude, foremost to my wife, Paula--we are newlyweds;  we have only been married 44 years--and to my two sons. Their support  has been the only reason that I have been able to do this.  I have been absent. I am sorry. I promise to do better.  Thank you as well to my staff. Every Member here knows we ain't  nothing without them. We are just the ornament on the hood of the car,  and they are the engine. They have both my undying love and gratitude.  Thank you to my colleagues. My life is enriched, and I am a better  person for having known you.  And a very special callout to my dear, dear friend, albeit messy  roommate, and an outstanding legislator, Derek Kilmer.  Last, thank you to the people of the 10th Congressional District of  Washington, whom I affectionately but sincerely refer to as my bosses.  You sent me here to represent a newly created congressional district.  It has truly been my privilege. Thank you.  Second, a plea, a plea to all those who follow here: Please, please  work to nurture this institution. Institutions sustain us, be they our  houses of worship for our faith or this secular equivalent for our  democracy. They get us through hard times, but only if we tend to them.  Citizens in a democracy have, of course, rights and responsibilities;  Members of this institution, this body, likewise. We are all too aware  of our rights here, but it is the responsibilities that bear  emphasizing.  We have a responsibility to conduct ourselves in a civil fashion. It  is self-evident that civic discourse in America has degraded; some  would say that it has even become vulgar.  You know, it is hard to reach agreement with a colleague tomorrow  that we have character assassinated today. So let us not measure our  success in terms of the number of Twitter followers we have gathered  through emotion-charged or clever attacks. Let us not define those with  whom we disagree, even if that disagreement is profound, as ``the  other.''  We live in a pluralistic society. Part of our responsibility is to  figure out how the political Rubik's Cube comes together; getting to  ``yes'' among different and competing points of view; fashioning a  result where everyone can get up from the table, perhaps not with  everything they sought, but with enough to vote ``yes'' while still  being true to their values.  There is such a thing as principled compromise. Indeed, I believe  that principled compromise is the only way we can move forward and lift  up those around us in desperate need of our help.  Do we no longer believe that? Or did we forget it?  Where I have failed to live up to these ideals, I beg your  forgiveness. I can only promise to keep trying.  Finally, I cannot help but think of the eternal wisdom of our former  colleague, John Dingell, the longest serving Member of this Chamber in  our Nation's history. When I arrived here, every first-term Member  walked on down to where he sat and sought his advice, and he gave the  same to everyone; the same to everyone. He would look us in the eye and  say:  You have an important job--a very important job--and you   are not a very important person.  Indeed, John taught us that we do not possess power, but that we only  hold it in trust. For the privilege of holding the trust for these last  8 years, I am forever changed and forever grateful.  I am 2,300 miles out and headed home.  With that, Mr. Speaker, I permanently yield back.    "
217,Jody Hice,0.8391735553741455,R,hice,hice," Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Colorado, my good friend, for leading this Special Order. I am indeed  honored to rise and celebrate and honor the book that, without  question, has transformed my life, brought light into my life and to  the entire world, and to join my colleagues in recognizing the most  significant book in the history of our Nation, its founding, and its  history throughout. Of course, we are talking about the Bible.  As a pastor of 25-plus years, prior to coming to Congress, this  opportunity to speak the Word of God on this floor is an extremely  important thing to me personally and to our Nation.  There is no question that Benjamin Franklin--and we have many, many,  many, many examples--and I have a lot of them in my office. But  Benjamin Franklin spoke very clear truth when he said that famous  statement that: ``The longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see  of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men.''  Without a doubt, it is in the Bible that we learn about the greatness  of God. We learn that He is the object of true worship, that He is the  fount of all blessings, that He is the light of the world. It is in the  Bible that we learn about the holiness of God. And, yes, it is in the  Bible that we learn about the sinfulness of every one of us as human  beings, that we have broken God's moral standard in one of a thousand  different ways.  But it is in the Bible also that we learn how much God loves us, and  in His great love, He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to pay the penalty  for our sins on that cross. It is in the Bible we learn that all of us  who trust in Him can receive the greatest gift that anyone could ever  receive, and that is the gift of forgiveness, which all of us need.  I cherish this moment to speak about the truths of God's Word. Our  country, as we all know, has been referred to over and over and over  throughout history as a shining city on a hill. But we also know today  that we are a Nation that stands at a critical crossroad. I believe it  is times like this, more than other times, perhaps, that the verse that  was quoted earlier, Psalm 119, verse 105, means so much to us. We need  to heed that God's Word is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our  path. More than ever, we need to heed, as a nation, as a body, as  leaders in this great Chamber, the Word of God and let it become our  light and our pathway.  It is, I believe, our responsibility, as leaders in this country, to  point our constituents, at least to the point of reminding them that  the Bible is extremely significant, not only to us as individuals, but  to us as a Nation, and that we need to encourage people to go back to  the teachings, the principles, the truths, the eternal truths of God's  Word. How different our Nation would be with that.  Again, I want to thank my friend for leading this Special Order and  all of my colleagues for taking time to come to speak to the truths of  God's Word.    "
218,Brian Higgins,0.2504095733165741,D,higgins,higgins," Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and  legacy of Robert Kresse, a western New York champion for those who had  none. Bob Kresse combined his lawyerly skills for estates and historic  preservation to become a powerful force for good in Buffalo for 70  years.  Bob Kresse knew well that his vision went beyond the bricks and  mortar of preservation; it was the restorative power of preservation on  the hearts of the people and the community that he loved that mattered  most.  Bob Kresse is survived by his beautiful family, including his beloved  wife of 56 years, Mary Ann. Bob would often say that Mary Ann didn't  just love him back; she was his chief collaborator and best friend  always, especially in those last, most difficult days.  The Niagara River Greenway, the King Urban Life Center, the Roycroft,  and the Darwin Martin House, among so many others, have a common  thread, and that is Bob Kresse's uncommon vision, love, and  perseverance.    "
219,Brian Higgins,0.2504095733165741,D,higgins,higgins," Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I  thank you, Mr. Speaker, for recognizing me.  My friend and colleague is discussing the deterioration of  traditional American values in our Nation this evening, and I think it  is appropriate that we as a nation take pause and reflect upon our own  lives, our own families and our histories, the traditions and cultures  which we represent, the men and women we strive to be as we seek, from  bended knee, the very deepest part of ourselves, the whisper of our  Lord Himself within us, His spirit that dwells there, to seek perhaps  the best part of us, the undiscovered and sometimes difficult-to- recognize truth that He has placed within our breast.  During the course of my life--I am 59 years old. I was born in 1961,  the seventh of eight children. I have witnessed the deterioration of  traditional American values.  As a failed and fallen man, arisen myself, redeemed by the blood of  our Lord and savior, I have contributed to the demise and deterioration  of our society in my small part. I struggle as a man.  Our journey, if you will, is to recognize that we are imperfect and  to seek that perfection, for our Nation itself was founded by imperfect  men who were driven by perfect intent.  The founding words of our original documents include, ``in order to  form a more perfect Union.'' This is a very humble statement by men of  wisdom and great stature of spirit. ``In order to form a more perfect  Union'' are words that recognize that we are imperfect men.  Therefore, during this time, this era of turmoil and tribulation and  violence and mob rule, great division--included amongst that division  is this Chamber--I think it is appropriate that my friend, that my  brother brings this to the focus of the Nation today.  Growing up in high school in the seventies, attended high school in  the seventies, every vehicle in the parking lot, a country school, had  a rifle or a shotgun in the back glass, maybe a pistol under the seat,  maybe all three. We didn't have school shootings.  When I began college in 1979 at LSU, I began to work my way through  college as a carpenter. The company I worked for, we did historical  renovations. In order to qualify, Mr. Speaker and my friend, for the  historical plaque for that renovation, a certain process had to be  followed. We had to determine the original structure of that residence.  You could tell by the nature of the cut, whether it was a power cut or  hand cut, how old it was; and with careful review and knowledgeable  eyes, you knew exactly how that home was originally built. This is what  fascinated me as a young man beginning college and working hard with my  hands with the skills my father had taught me.  Do you know what these houses built 100 years ago in the middle of a  large city, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, do you know what they didn't have,  Mr. Speaker and my friend?  I will answer that question to observe the rules of the House.  Do you know what those houses did not have 100 years ago? Locks. They  had no locks.  Now, Mr. Speaker, I ask us all to reflect on what happened to that  country. What happened to the country that was bequeathed unto us, a  country where the parking lots of high schools were filled with  vehicles with weapons and we had no school shootings, a country where  homes were built in cities with no locks? What happened to that  country?  I am prayerful that the answer to what happened to that country lies,  as it always has, deep within us as men and women, as children of God.  And we must seek, as a nation and within this Chamber, by this body, we  must seek the guidance of our savior, His whisper deep to guide us  through these troubling times.  I am thankful for men and leaders like my friend Representative  Arrington, who has, by the grace of God, brought this topic to the  floor today, and I am humbled that he would allow me to rise unscripted  and address my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and the American  people, whom I love.  Let us return to the civility, love, and respect that founded our  Nation, for therein is born courage and the will to move forward  through any challenge.    "
220,Brian Higgins,0.2504095733165741,D,higgins,higgins," Mr. HIGGINS of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I stand today in solidarity with  46,000 United Automobile Workers who are now entering their fifth week  on strike following the expiration of their contract in September.  Ironically, this September also marked the end of GM's third quarter,  where it sold 737,000 vehicles, more than any other U.S. automaker,  recording record profits and capturing nearly 18 percent of market  share.  GM cited product quality and reliability for its continued strong  sales. The United Automobile Workers made those 737,000 vehicles with  pride and dedication and attention to detail.  The United Automobile Workers made sacrifices to keep GM whole when  the automaker faced bankruptcy 10 years ago. Now those workers simply  want to keep their families whole with good healthcare, fair wages, and  job security.  With record sales, a fair deal is within reach, one that secures the  long-term success of General Motors and a better future for United  Automobile Workers. Let's get the deal done.    "
221,Brian Higgins,0.2504095733165741,D,higgins,higgins," Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon, the House will vote to  approve a $1.5 trillion transportation and infrastructure bill.  This American nation-building program will be the largest in American  history. The Public Works Administration of 1930s spent nearly $700  billion in today's dollars. This building program will more than double  that investment, creating millions of jobs in the construction trades,  jobs in the supply and materials industry, and jobs in the engineering  and design industries as well.  The program is good for economic growth at a time when our Nation is  desperate for economic growth. For every dollar invested in  infrastructure, that investment returns $1.80, or an 80 percent return  on investment, to the United States economy.  The President and both political parties have promised a robust  infrastructure investment. Now is the time to reconcile that rhetoric  with action.  Mr. Speaker, I urge approval of this bill.    "
222,Clay Higgins,1.3229215145111084,R,higgins,higgins," Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and  legacy of Robert Kresse, a western New York champion for those who had  none. Bob Kresse combined his lawyerly skills for estates and historic  preservation to become a powerful force for good in Buffalo for 70  years.  Bob Kresse knew well that his vision went beyond the bricks and  mortar of preservation; it was the restorative power of preservation on  the hearts of the people and the community that he loved that mattered  most.  Bob Kresse is survived by his beautiful family, including his beloved  wife of 56 years, Mary Ann. Bob would often say that Mary Ann didn't  just love him back; she was his chief collaborator and best friend  always, especially in those last, most difficult days.  The Niagara River Greenway, the King Urban Life Center, the Roycroft,  and the Darwin Martin House, among so many others, have a common  thread, and that is Bob Kresse's uncommon vision, love, and  perseverance.    "
223,Clay Higgins,1.3229215145111084,R,higgins,higgins," Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I  thank you, Mr. Speaker, for recognizing me.  My friend and colleague is discussing the deterioration of  traditional American values in our Nation this evening, and I think it  is appropriate that we as a nation take pause and reflect upon our own  lives, our own families and our histories, the traditions and cultures  which we represent, the men and women we strive to be as we seek, from  bended knee, the very deepest part of ourselves, the whisper of our  Lord Himself within us, His spirit that dwells there, to seek perhaps  the best part of us, the undiscovered and sometimes difficult-to- recognize truth that He has placed within our breast.  During the course of my life--I am 59 years old. I was born in 1961,  the seventh of eight children. I have witnessed the deterioration of  traditional American values.  As a failed and fallen man, arisen myself, redeemed by the blood of  our Lord and savior, I have contributed to the demise and deterioration  of our society in my small part. I struggle as a man.  Our journey, if you will, is to recognize that we are imperfect and  to seek that perfection, for our Nation itself was founded by imperfect  men who were driven by perfect intent.  The founding words of our original documents include, ``in order to  form a more perfect Union.'' This is a very humble statement by men of  wisdom and great stature of spirit. ``In order to form a more perfect  Union'' are words that recognize that we are imperfect men.  Therefore, during this time, this era of turmoil and tribulation and  violence and mob rule, great division--included amongst that division  is this Chamber--I think it is appropriate that my friend, that my  brother brings this to the focus of the Nation today.  Growing up in high school in the seventies, attended high school in  the seventies, every vehicle in the parking lot, a country school, had  a rifle or a shotgun in the back glass, maybe a pistol under the seat,  maybe all three. We didn't have school shootings.  When I began college in 1979 at LSU, I began to work my way through  college as a carpenter. The company I worked for, we did historical  renovations. In order to qualify, Mr. Speaker and my friend, for the  historical plaque for that renovation, a certain process had to be  followed. We had to determine the original structure of that residence.  You could tell by the nature of the cut, whether it was a power cut or  hand cut, how old it was; and with careful review and knowledgeable  eyes, you knew exactly how that home was originally built. This is what  fascinated me as a young man beginning college and working hard with my  hands with the skills my father had taught me.  Do you know what these houses built 100 years ago in the middle of a  large city, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, do you know what they didn't have,  Mr. Speaker and my friend?  I will answer that question to observe the rules of the House.  Do you know what those houses did not have 100 years ago? Locks. They  had no locks.  Now, Mr. Speaker, I ask us all to reflect on what happened to that  country. What happened to the country that was bequeathed unto us, a  country where the parking lots of high schools were filled with  vehicles with weapons and we had no school shootings, a country where  homes were built in cities with no locks? What happened to that  country?  I am prayerful that the answer to what happened to that country lies,  as it always has, deep within us as men and women, as children of God.  And we must seek, as a nation and within this Chamber, by this body, we  must seek the guidance of our savior, His whisper deep to guide us  through these troubling times.  I am thankful for men and leaders like my friend Representative  Arrington, who has, by the grace of God, brought this topic to the  floor today, and I am humbled that he would allow me to rise unscripted  and address my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and the American  people, whom I love.  Let us return to the civility, love, and respect that founded our  Nation, for therein is born courage and the will to move forward  through any challenge.    "
224,Clay Higgins,1.3229215145111084,R,higgins,higgins," Mr. HIGGINS of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I stand today in solidarity with  46,000 United Automobile Workers who are now entering their fifth week  on strike following the expiration of their contract in September.  Ironically, this September also marked the end of GM's third quarter,  where it sold 737,000 vehicles, more than any other U.S. automaker,  recording record profits and capturing nearly 18 percent of market  share.  GM cited product quality and reliability for its continued strong  sales. The United Automobile Workers made those 737,000 vehicles with  pride and dedication and attention to detail.  The United Automobile Workers made sacrifices to keep GM whole when  the automaker faced bankruptcy 10 years ago. Now those workers simply  want to keep their families whole with good healthcare, fair wages, and  job security.  With record sales, a fair deal is within reach, one that secures the  long-term success of General Motors and a better future for United  Automobile Workers. Let's get the deal done.    "

226,French Hill,1.4772007465362549,R,hill,hill," Ms. HILL. Based on questions and statements I have heard,   some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia   and its security services did not conduct a campaign against   our country and that perhaps, somehow for some reason,   Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative being perpetrated   and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.  The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power   that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in   2016. This is the public conclusion of our intelligence   agencies confirmed in bipartisan and congressional reports.   It is beyond dispute, even if some of the underlying details   must remain classified.  The impacts of the successful 2016 Russian campaign remain   evident today. Our Nation is being torn apart. The truth is   questioned. Our highly professional, expert career Foreign   Service is being undermined. U.S. support for Ukraine which   continues to face armed Russian aggression is being   politicized. The Russian Government's goal is to weaken our   country, to diminish America's global role, and to neutralize   a perceived U.S. threat to Russian interests.  Mr. Manager NADLER. President Trump knew this too. His former  Homeland Security Advisor, Tom Bossert, said that the idea that Ukraine  hacked the DNC server was ``not only a conspiracy theory, it is  completely debunked,'' and he and other U.S. officials spent hours with  the President explaining why.  The second false allegation that the President wanted the Ukrainians  to announce was that Vice President Biden used his power to protect a  company on whose board his son sat by forcing the removal of Viktor  Shokin, the corrupt former prosecutor general.  It is true that Vice President Biden helped remove Mr. Shokin, who  was widely believed to be corrupt. As I said a few minutes ago, it was  official policy of the United States, the European community, and  others, in order to fight corruption in Ukraine, to ask that Shokin and  Lutsenko be removed. So the Vice President, Vice President Biden, in  fulfilling U.S. policy, pressured Ukraine to remove Shokin--not to  secure some personal benefit but to advance the official policy of the  United States and its allies. Even Lutsenko, who initially seeded the  allegations against Mr. Biden in American media, later admitted that  the allegations against the Vice President were false. And Rudy  Giuliani told Kurt Volker, the Special Representative for Ukrainian  Negotiations, who had a prominent role in the scheme, that he also knew  the attacks on Joe Biden were a lie.  With Ambassador Yovanovitch out of the way, the first chapter of the  Ukraine scheme was complete. Mr. Giuliani and his agents could now  apply direct pressure to the Ukrainian Government to spread these two  falsehoods.  Who benefited from this scheme? Who sent Mr. Giuliani to Ukraine in  the first place? Of course we could rephrase that question as the  former Republican leader of the Senate, Howard Baker, asked it in 1973:  What did the President know, and when he did he know it?  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, President's  counsel: President Trump and President Zelensky's relationship started  out well. President Trump wanted the two investigations from Zelensky,  and he had no reason to believe he would not get what he wanted.  On April 21, 2019, Volodymyr Zelensky, who was new to politics, won a  landslide victory in Ukraine's Presidential election. That evening,  President Trump called Zelensky to congratulate him. On that first  call--the first call--Zelensky invited President Trump to visit Ukraine  for the upcoming inauguration. President Trump, in turn, promised that  his administration would send someone at ``a very, very high level.''  During that same April call, President Trump invited President  Zelensky to the White House, saying:  When you're settled in and ready, I'd like to invite you to   the White House. We'll have a lot of things to talk about,   but we're with you all the way.  Zelensky immediately accepted the President's invitation, adding that  the ``whole team and I are looking forward to that visit.''  Numerous witnesses testified about the significance of a White House  meeting for the political newcomer. A White House meeting would show  Ukrainians that America supported Zelensky's anti-corruption platform.  The clear backing of the President of the United States--Ukraine's most  important patron--would also send a powerful message to Russia that we  had Ukraine's back.  During that April 21 call, President Trump never even uttered the  word ``corruption,'' but the official White House call recap falsely  stated that the two Presidents had discussed Ukraine's anti-corruption  efforts.  Shortly after the phone call, Jennifer Williams, adviser to Vice  President Pence, learned that President Trump asked Vice President  Pence to attend Zelensky's inauguration.  Williams and her colleagues began planning Pence's trip to Kyiv. At  the same time, Giuliani was trying to get Ukraine to investigate the  Bidens and alleged 2016 election interference. On April 24, Giuliani  went on ``FOX & Friends'' and had this to say:  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Keep your eye on Ukraine, because in Ukraine a lot of dirty   work was done. I'm digging up the information. American   officials were used. Ukrainian officials were used. That is   like collusion with the Ukrainians and--or actually, in this   case, conspiracy with the Ukrainians. I think you'd get some   interesting information about Joe Biden from Ukraine. About   his son, Hunter Biden. About a company he was on the board of   for years, which may be one of the most crooked companies in   Ukraine.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. For this campaign to be truly beneficial  to his boss President Trump, Giuliani needed access to the new  government in Ukraine. He dispatched his associates Lev Parnas and Igor  Fruman to try to make inroads with Zelensky's team.  On April 25, former Vice President Biden publicly announced his bid  for Presidency, and immediately he was at the top of the polls.  That same day, David Holmes, an American diplomat at our Embassy in  Ukraine, learned that Giuliani had reached out to the head of President  Zelensky's campaign. As Mr. Holmes explained, the new Ukrainian  Government began to think that Giuliani [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S460"">Page S460</a>, ] ``was a significant person in terms of managing their relationship with  the United States.''  As Giuliani and his associates worked behind the scenes to get access  to the new leadership in Ukraine, President Trump was publicly  signaling his interest in the investigations. On May 2, the President  appeared on FOX News. When asked, ``Should the former vice president  explain himself on his feeling in Ukraine and whether there was a  conflict . . . with his son's business interests?'' President Trump  replied as follows:  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  I'm hearing it's a major scandal, major problem. Very bad   things happened, and we'll see what that is. They even have   him on tape, talking about it. They have Joe Biden on tape   talking about the prosecutor. And I've seen that tape. A lot   of people are talking about that tape, but that's up to them.   They have to solve that problem.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. The tape President Trump referenced is a  video from January 2018 in which Vice President Biden explained that he  placed an ultimatum to the Ukrainian President to remove the corrupt  prosecutor general to ensure that taxpayer money would be used  appropriately. The Vice President's actions were consistent with  official U.S. policy as well as the opinions of the international  community.  On May 9, the New York Times published an article about Giuliani's  plan to visit Ukraine. In the article, Giuliani confirmed that he  planned to meet with Zelensky. At that meeting, he wanted to press the  Ukrainian Government to pursue the investigations that President Trump  promoted only days earlier. Giuliani said: ``We're not meddling in an  election, we are meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to  do.''  Giuliani even went so far as to acknowledge that his actions could  benefit President Trump personally. He said: ``[T]his isn't foreign  policy--I'm asking them to do an investigation that they're doing  already and that other people are telling them to stop. And I am going  to give them reasons why they shouldn't stop it because that  information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out  to be helpful to my government.''  That is it right there--Giuliani admitting he was asking Ukraine to  work an investigation that would be ``very, very helpful'' to the  President. He was not doing foreign policy. He was not doing this on  behalf of the government. He was doing this for the personal interests  of his client, Donald J. Trump.  The next morning, on May 10, amid coverage of his planned trip to  Ukraine, Giuliani tweeted further about Biden and then had a flurry of  calls with Parnas, who was helping in planning his trip to Ukraine.  That same day, Giuliani also spoke with Ambassador Volker on the  phone for more than 30 minutes. Ambassador Volker had learned that  Giuliani had intended to travel to Ukraine and had called to warn  Giuliani that Prosecutor General Lutsenko ``is not credible. Don't  listen to what he is saying.''  Later that day, Giuliani had a 17-minute call with a masked White  House number before speaking again with Parnas for 12 minutes.  That same day, on May 10, Politico asked President Trump about  Giuliani's upcoming trip, and he replied, ``I have not spoken to him at  any great length, but I will. . . . I will speak to him about it before  he leaves.'' But that evening, on FOX News, Giuliani announced: ``I'm  not going to go'' to Ukraine ``because I think I'm walking into a group  of people that are enemies of the President.'' Separately, in a text  message to ``Politico,'' Giuliani alleged that the original offer for a  meeting with Zelensky was a ``set-up.'' He said it was a set-up  orchestrated by ``several vocal critics'' of President Trump who were  advising Zelensky. Giuliani declared that ``Zelensky is in [the] hands  of avowed enemies of President Trump.''  But Giuliani had not stopped trying. He had Parnas send a letter to  Zelensky's senior aide on May 11 asking for a meeting. That letter made  it clear that Giuliani was representing President Trump as ``a private  citizen'' and that he was working with President Trump's ``knowledge  and consent.''  The letter is on the slide. It reads:  In my capacity as personal counsel to President Trump and   with his knowledge and consent, I request a meeting with you   on this upcoming Monday, May 13, or Tuesday, May 14. I will   need no more than a half-hour of your time and I will be   accompanied by my colleague Victoria Toensing, a   distinguished American attorney who is very familiar with the   matter.  But it did not appear that Giuliani and Parnas's attempts to get the  meeting were working. That same day, Giuliani sent a text message to  Parnas asking, ``This guy is canceling meeting, I think?''  Approximately 3 hours later, Giuliani sent Parnas drafts of a public  statement that ``people advising the PRES ELECT are no friends of the  President.''  Three days later, President Trump instructed Vice President Pence not  to attend the inauguration in Ukraine--just 3 days later. Vice  Presidential staffer Jennifer Williams received a surprising call from  Pence's Chief of Staff. She described it during her public testimony.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  On May 13th, an assistant to the Vice President's chief of   staff called and informed me that President Trump had decided   that the Vice President would not attend the inauguration in   Ukraine. She did not provide any further explanation. I   relayed that instruction to others involved in planning the   potential trip. I also informed the NSC that the Vice   President would not be attending, so that it could identify a   head of delegation to represent the United States at   President-elect Zelensky's inauguration.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Notably, Williams confirmed that the  inauguration date had not yet been scheduled at the time of that phone  call. So the reason for President Trump's decision was certainly not  due to a scheduling conflict.  Secretary of Energy Rick Perry ultimately led the delegation to the  inaugural. Accompanying Secretary Perry were Ambassador to the European  Union, Gordon Sondland; Ambassador Volker; NSC Director for Ukraine,  LTC Alexander Vindman; and Senator Ron Johnson also attended many of  the inaugural events with the delegation. When asked if this delegation  was a good group, Holmes replied that it ``was not as senior a  delegation as we might have expected.''  After the inauguration, Ambassadors Volker and Sondland left Kyiv  with a very favorable impression of President Zelensky. Ambassador  Volker said they believed it was important that President Trump  personally engage with the President of Ukraine in order to demonstrate  full U.S. support for him.  When the inauguration team returned to the United States, they had a  meeting with President Trump on May 23. The May 23 meeting with  President Trump proved to be important for two good reasons. First,  with Ambassador Yovanovitch out of the way, President Trump authorized  Ambassador Sondland, Secretary Perry, and Ambassador Volker to lead  engagement with the new administration in Ukraine; and two, President  Trump instructed them to satisfy Giuliani's concerns in order to move  forward on Ukraine matters.  These officials were all political appointees, and Ambassador  Sondland had donated $1 million to the President's inauguration. The  President saw these three political appointees as officials who would  fulfill his requests.  Ambassador Volker testified that he, Ambassador Sondland, Secretary  Perry, and Senator Johnson took turns making their case that this is a  new crowd. It is a new President in Ukraine. He is committed to doing  the right things, including fighting corruption. They recommended that  President Trump follow through on his invitation for President Zelensky  to meet with him in the Oval Office, but President Trump did not  receive the recommendation well.  At his public hearing, Ambassador Volker described the May 23 Oval  Office meeting with President Trump. Let's listen.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador VOLKER. We stressed our finding that President   Zelensky represented the best chance for getting Ukraine out   of the mire of corruption it had been in for over 20 years.   We urged him [President Trump] to invite President Zelensky   to the White House. The President was very skeptical. Given   Ukraine's history of corruption, that's understandable. He   said that Ukraine was a corrupt country, full of terrible   people. He said, ``They tried to take me down.'' In the   course of that conversation, he referenced conversations with   Mayor Giuliani. It was [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S461"">Page S461</a>, ]  clear to me that despite the positive news and   recommendations being conveyed by this official delegation   about the new President, President Trump had a deeply rooted   negative view on Ukraine rooted in the past. He was receiving   other information from other sources, including Mayor   Giuliani, that was more negative, causing him to retain this   negative view.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Witnesses said the reference to ``taking  me down'' was to unfounded allegations that Ukraine had interfered in  the 2016 election. This was what President Trump considered to be  corruption in Ukraine.  The President's words echoed Giuliani's public statements about  Ukraine in early May. Rather than committing to an Oval Office meeting  with the Ukrainian leader, President Trump directed the delegation to  talk to Giuliani. Here is how Ambassador Sondland described that  instruction from the President.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador SONDLAND. If we wanted to get anything done with   Ukraine, it was apparent to us we needed to talk to Rudy.  GOLDMAN. Right. You understood that Giuliani spoke for the   President, correct?  Ambassador SONDLAND. That's correct.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Ambassador Sondland saw the writing on  the wall. Sondland concluded that if we did not talk to Rudy, nothing  would move forward on Ukraine.  The three amigos, as they called themselves, did as the President  ordered and began talking to Giuliani. Dr. Hill testified Volker,  Sondland, and Perry ``gave us every impression that they were meeting  with Rudy Giuliani at this point, and Rudy Giuliani was also saying on  the television, and indeed had said subsequently, that he was closely  coordinating with the State Department.''  Like Dr. Hill, Ambassador Bolton closely tracked Giuliani's Ukraine- related activities. Hill testified about a conversation she had with  Bolton in May of 2019. That conversation was revealing, so let's  listen.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Dr. HILL. . . . And I had already brought to Ambassador   Bolton's attention the attacks, the smear campaign against   Ambassador Yovanovitch and expressed great regret about how   this was unfolding and, in fact, the shameful way in which   Ambassador Yovanovitch was being smeared and attacked.  And I had asked him if there was anything we could do about   it, and Ambassador Bolton had looked pained, basically   indicated with body language that there was nothing much we   could do about it. And he then in the course of that   discussion said that Rudy Giuliani was a hand grenade that   was going to blow everyone up.  GOLDMAN. Did you understand what he meant by that?  Dr. HILL. I did, actually.  GOLDMAN. What did he mean?  Dr. HILL. Well, I think he meant that obviously what Mr.   Giuliani was saying was pretty explosive, in any case. He was   frequently on television making quite incendiary remarks   about everyone involved in this and that he was clearly   pushing forward issues and ideas that would, you know,   probably come back to haunt us. And, in fact, I think that   that's where we are today.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. According to Dr. Hill's description,  Bolton said that Giuliani's influence could be an obstacle to increased  White House engagement with Ukraine. He instructed his staff not to  meet with Giuliani.  In June, Volker and Sondland relayed to Ambassador Taylor that  President Trump wanted to hear from Zelensky before scheduling the  meeting in the Oval Office. Ambassador Taylor testified that he did not  understand at the time what that meant.  Around this time, the President publicly expressed that he thought it  would be OK to accept foreign interference to assist his campaign if it  was in the form of opposition research on his opponent. Let's listen  to that shocking interview.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  STEPHANOPOULOS. Your campaign this time around, if   foreigners, if Russia, if China, if someone else offers you   information on opponents, should they accept it or should   they call the FBI?  PRESIDENT TRUMP. I think maybe you do both. I think you   might want to listen, there's nothing wrong with listening.   If somebody called from a country, Norway, ``we have   information on your opponent.'' Oh, I think I'd want to hear   it.  STEPHANOPOULOS. You want that kind of interference in our   elections?  PRESIDENT TRUMP. It's not an interference, they have   information. I think I'd take it.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Shocking video. Meanwhile, Giuliani  continued to press Ukraine to do the President's political dirty work.  On June 21, for instance, Giuliani tweeted the following:  New Pres of Ukraine still silent on investigation of   Ukrainian interference in 2016 election and alleged Biden   bribery of Pres Poroshenko. Time for leadership and   investigate both if you want to purge how Ukraine was abused   by Hillary and Obama people.  The quid pro quo scheme was taking shape. Giuliani was publicly  advocating for Ukraine to conduct politically motivated investigations  while President Trump refused to schedule an Oval Office meeting for  Ukraine's new President. As Ambassador Sondland testified, the scheme  to pressure Ukraine to conduct these investigations would only get more  insidious with time.  Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, the majority leader expressed a  preference for a break about 2 hours in. So it is the House managers'  request that I present, and then we take the break, if that is  acceptable for everybody.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Any objection? Move forward.  Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, counsel  for the President, and the American people, where were you on July 25,  2019? It was a Thursday. Members of the U.S. Senate were here in this  Chamber. On July 25, across the Atlantic, our 68,000 troops stationed  throughout Europe were doing what they do every day--training and  preparing to support our allies and defend against Russia.  The professionalism and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform is  a source of great strength, but America is also strong and America is  also secure because we have friends. On July 25, 2019, one of those  friends was a man named Oleksandr Markiv. In a story told by Sabra  Ayers of the Los Angeles Times, Oleksandr was a soldier in the  Ukrainian Army defending his country and Europe against Russian-backed  forces on Ukraine's eastern front. He was in a trench. He was 38 years  old. Oleksandr would later die defending his country during a mortar  attack on his fighting position, giving his life, just like over 13,000  of his fellow Ukrainians, on the frontlines of the fight for liberty in  Europe.  That same Los Angeles Times article painted a picture of what the  Ukrainians were going through during this time.  Tens of thousands of Ukrainians, like Markiv, volunteered to help  fight the Russian-backed separatists in the east. Many of them were  sent to the front line wearing sneakers and without flak jackets and  helmets, let alone rifles and ammunition. Ukrainians across the country  organized in an unprecedented united civil movement not seen since  World War II to raise money to supply their ragtag military with  everything from soldiers' boots to bullets.  And while our friends were at war with Russia wearing sneakers, some  without helmets, something else was happening. On July 25, President  Trump made a phone call. He spoke with Ukrainian President Zelensky and  asked for a favor. On that same day, just hours after his call, his  administration was quietly placing an illegal hold on critical military  aid to support our friends.  So why should any American care about what is happening in Ukraine?  Timothy Morrison, former senior director for Europe and Russia at the  NSC put it bluntly:  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Timothy MORRISON. I continue to believe Ukraine is on the   front lines of a strategic competition between the West and   Vladimir Putin's revanchist Russia. Russia is a failing   power, but it is still a dangerous one. The United States   aids Ukraine and her people so that they can fight Russia   over there, and we don't have to fight Russia here. Support   for Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty has been   a bipartisan objective since Russia's military invasion in   2014. It must continue to be.  Mr. Manager CROW. We help our partner fight Russia over there so we  don't have to fight Russia here--our friends on the frontlines, in  trenches, and with sneakers.  Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, the United States has  stood by Ukraine. Our diplomats and military commanders have long said [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S462"">Page S462</a>, ] that supporting Ukraine makes us safer. But you don't need me to tell  you that; you all know it very well. When the funding for the security  assistance came up for a vote under this roof, 87 of you voted for the  aid.  Many of you have been staunch advocates for Ukraine, working in a  nonpartisan way to support our friends. That support makes a lot of  sense because politics should not play a part in ensuring that Ukraine  can battle Russian aggression and ensure that freedom wins in Europe.  This body has, in so many ways, set that example.  Protecting Europe from Russia is not a political game. Let me provide  some background. In early 2014, in what became known as the Revolution  of Dignity, Ukrainian citizens demanded democratic reforms and an end  to corruption, ousting the pro-Russian President. Within days, Russian  military forces and their proxies invaded Ukraine, annexing Crimea and  occupying portions of eastern Ukraine.  Since 2014, more than 13,000 Ukrainians have been killed because of  the conflict and over 1.4 million have been forced from their homes.  Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the first attempt to redraw Europe's  border since World War II.  In 2017, then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis summed it up well. He  said: ``Despite Russia's denials, we know they are seeking to redraw  international borders by force, undermining the sovereign and free  nations of Europe.''  And as Ambassador Taylor put it, Russian aggression in Ukraine  ``dismissed all the principles that have kept the peace and contributed  to prosperity in Europe since World War II.''  It is clear that Russia is not just a threat in Europe but for  democracy and freedom around the world. Our friends and allies have  also responded, imposing sanctions on Russia and providing billions of  dollars in economic, humanitarian, and security assistance to Ukraine.  This has been an international effort.  Today, the European Union is the single largest contributor of  foreign assistance to Ukraine, having provided roughly $12 billion in  grants and loans since 2014. The United States has provided over $3  billion in assistance in that time, because we all know that we can't  separate our own security from the security of our friends and allies.  That is why the United States has provided economic security and  humanitarian assistance in the form of equipment and training.  Ambassador Taylor testified that American aid is a concrete  demonstration of our ``commitment to resist aggression and defend  freedom.'' He also detailed the many benefits of our assistance for  Ukraine's forces.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Chairman, the security assistance   that we provide takes many forms. One of the components of   that assistance is counter-battery radar. Another component   are sniper weapons.  These weapons and this assistance allows the Ukrainian   military to deter further incursions by the Russians against   their own--against Ukrainian territory. If that further   incursion, further aggression, were to take place, more   Ukrainians would die. So it is a deterrent effect that these   weapons provide.  It's also the ability--it gives the Ukrainians the ability   to negotiate from a position of a little more strength when   they negotiate an end to the war in Donbas, negotiating with   the Russians. This also is a way that would reduce the number   of Ukrainians who would die.  Mr. Manager CROW. I would like to make a finer point of how this type  of aid helps because I know something about counter-battery radar.  In 2005, I was an Army Ranger serving in a special operations task  force in Afghanistan. We were at a remote operating base along the  Afghan-Pakistan border. Frequently, the insurgence that we were  fighting would launch rockets and missiles onto our small base. But,  luckily, we were provided with counter-battery radar. So 20, 30, 40  seconds before those rockets and mortars rained down on us, an alarm  would sound. We would run out from our tents and jump into our concrete  bunkers and wait for the attack to end. This is not a theoretical  exercise, and the Ukrainians know it, for Ukraine aid from the United  States actually constitutes about 10 percent of their military budget.  It is safe to say that they can't fight effectively without it.  So there is no doubt. U.S. military assistance in Ukraine makes a  real difference in the fight against Russia.  In 2019, Congress provided $391 million in security assistance. This  included $250 million through the Department of Defense's Ukraine  Security Assistance Initiative, USAI, and $141 million through the  State Department's Foreign Military Financing Program, FMF.  President Trump signed the bill to authorize this aid in August 2018  and signed another bill to fund it the following month. The aid was  underway. The train was leaving the station and following the same  track it had followed every single year. But all of this was about to  change.  In July of 2019, President Trump ordered the Office of Management and  Budget, OMB, to put a hold on all of the aid. The President personally  made this decision even after his own appointed advisers warned him  that it wasn't in our country's interest to withhold the aid--after  overwhelming support in this Senate--and against longstanding policy,  even in his own administration.  But what is most interesting to me about this is that he was only  interested in the Ukraine aid, nobody else. The United States provides  aid to dozens of countries around the world, lots of partners and  allies. He didn't ask about any of them--just Ukraine.  The most important question here is why would he do that? What was  his motivation? Well, we now know why.  This hold shocked people across our own government. The Department of  Defense, along with the State Department, had already certified to  Congress that Ukraine had implemented sufficient anti-corruption  reforms to get the funds, and the Defense Department had already  notified Congress of its intent to deliver the assistance.  So let's recap all of this. Congress had already funded it. Our own  government had already certified that it met all of the standards that  it met every other year, and Congress had already been notified, just  like every other year.  In a series of meetings of the National Security Agency, everyone  except the OMB supported the provision of the assistance. OMB, as we  know, is headed by Mick Mulvaney, the President's Chief of Staff.  Ukraine experts at DOD, the State Department, and the White House  emphasized that it was in the national security interest of the United  States to continue to support Ukraine in its fight. But it wasn't just  the national security concern, because many people thought that the  hold was just outright illegal. And they were right. It was.  The President's hold did violate the law, because just last week,  Congress's independent, nonpartisan watchdog, the Government  Accountability Office, released an opinion finding that the hold was  illegal.  President Trump held the military aid money for so long that the  administration ran out of time to spend the money. Ultimately, even  after the President lifted the hold on September 11--again, with no  clear explanation why--we, the Congress, had to pass another law to  extend the deadline, delaying the delivery of the aid.  In the same L.A. Times article that told the story about our friend  Mr. Markiv, a Ukrainian defense spokesperson said that even though the  hold had been lifted--this was in September--it ``has not reached us  yet.'' That spokesperson went on to say: ``It is not just money from  the bank. It is arms, equipment and hardware.''  And to this day, millions of dollars still haven't been spent.  Although our government neither informed Ukraine of the hold nor  publicly announced it, Ukraine quickly learned about it.  On July 25, the same day as President Trump's call with President  Zelensky, officials at Ukraine's Embassy here in Washington emailed DOD  to ask about the status of the funding. By mid-August, officials at  DOD, the State Department, and the NSC received numerous questions from  Ukrainian officials about the hold. Everyone was worried. It is not  just because of the urgent need for the equipment on the frontlines but  also because of the message that it sent. You see, President Zelensky  had just been sworn in. They were very vulnerable. And, as we all know,  Vladimir Putin looks for vulnerability. He looks for hesitation. He  looks for delay. And any public sign of a hold on that aid could be a  sign of [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S463"">Page S463</a>, ] weakness that could show him it was time to pounce.  President Trump's hold on Ukraine assistance was eventually publicly  reported on August 28. As we will explain, Ukraine fully understood  that the hold was connected to the investigations that President Trump  wanted.  On February 28, DOD notified Congress that it intended to deliver  $125 million of assistance appropriated in September, including ``more  than $50 million of assistance to deliver counter-artillery radars and  defense lethal assistance.'' Congress cleared the notification, which  enabled DOD to begin spending the funds.  For Ukraine to receive the remaining $125 million, Congress required  that the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of  State, certify that the Government of Ukraine had taken substantial  anti-corruption reforms.  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper and senior  officials across our government conducted a review to evaluate whether  Ukraine had met the required benchmarks.  Ms. Cooper explained that the review involved ``pulling in all the  views of the key experts on Ukraine defense, and coming up with a  consensus view,'' which was then run ``up the chain in the Defense  Department, to ensure we have approval.''  By May 23, the anti-corruption review was complete, and DOD certified  to Congress that Ukraine had complied with all of the conditions and  that the remaining half of the aid should be released. But, again, you  don't have to take my word for it. On May 23, in a letter to Congress,  one of President Trump's senior political appointees, the Under  Secretary of Defense for Policy, wrote: ``On behalf of the Secretary of  Defense, and in coordination with the Secretary of State, I have  certified that the Government of Ukraine has taken substantial actions  to make defense institutional reforms for the purposes of decreasing  corruption, increasing accountability, and sustaining improvements of  combat capability enabled by U.S. assistance.''  Congress then cleared the funding, which should have allowed Ukraine  to receive the aid. But we know that is not what happened.  On June 18, as DOD was preparing to send the aid, they issued a press  release--as they normally do--announcing that it would provide $250  million in security assistance to Ukraine ``for additional training,  equipment, and advisory efforts to build the capacity of Ukraine's  armed forces.'' This included sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenades,  counter-artillery radars, command and control, electronic warfare,  secure communications, vehicles, night vision, and medical  equipment. However, according to the New York Times, 1 day after the  Defense Department issued this press release--1 day--Assistant to the  President Robert Blair, who works for Mick Mulvaney, called OMB Acting  Director Russell Vought to tell him: ``We need to hold it up.'' The  ``it'' was the assistance.  That same day, June 19, President Trump gave an interview on FOX News  where he raised the so-called CrowdStrike conspiracy theory that  Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 2016 election, a line he  would echo during his July 25 call with President Zelensky. This  theory, by the way, has been advanced by Russian propaganda to try to  take attention away from Russian interference and shift it onto  Ukraine. It is a theory that has been universally debunked by U.S.  intelligence and law enforcement.  Nonetheless, the President, spurred by the June 18 press release and  with the false theory about the Ukraine interference, supposedly, in  the 2016 election, started asking about the Ukraine assistance. On June  19, OMB Associate Director for National Security Michael Duffey emailed  Elaine McCusker, the DOD comptroller. He said the President had  questions about the press report and that he was seeking additional  information. This was a reference to an article in the Washington  Examiner, shown here on the slide in front of you.  The White House withheld this email from the House, of course. We  first learned of it from Duffey's deputy, Mark Sandy, who testified  that he was copied on it. Subsequently, as a result of a lawsuit under  the Freedom of Information Act, the public and, therefore, Congress  received a copy of that email, but the White House still refuses to  comply with the subpoenas for this and other documents.  On June 20, McCusker responded to President Trump's inquiry by  providing Sandy information on the security assistance program. Sandy  shared the information with Duffey, but he did not know whether Duffey  shared the information with the White House. Laura Cooper also recalled  receiving an email inquiry about Ukraine's security assistance ``a few  days'' after DOD's June 18 press release. She noted that it was  ``relatively unusual'' to receive questions from the President. In  response, DOD provided materials explaining that the $250 million  funding package was for additional training, equipment, and advisory  efforts to build the capacity of Ukraine's Armed Forces. DOD emphasized  that ``almost all of the dozens of vendors are U.S. companies,''  meaning that this funding also benefited U.S. businesses and workers.  Nonetheless, President Trump put the wheels in motion to freeze the  funds shortly after learning about DOD's plan to release the funds.  According to a New York Times article on June 27, Chief of Staff  Mulvaney emailed Blair:  I am just trying to tie up some loose ends. Did we ever   find out about the money from Ukraine and whether we can hold   it back?  Blair reportedly responded that it would be possible but not pretty.  He added: ``Expect Congress to become unhinged.'' I suppose he said  that for all the reasons we have talked about earlier, because this  Chamber and our Chamber on the other side of the Capitol resoundingly  supports it.  And that was just the Defense Department assistance to Ukraine. For  2019, Congress also appropriated $141 million to Ukraine through the  State Department. Unlike the Defense Department funding, which was  approved by Congress and ready to be spent, OMB blocked the State  Department from even seeking Congress's approval to release the funds.  I am going to pause here to, once again, stress that we have learned  a lot about the circumstances around the initial hold only from the  public release of and reporting about these emails in the past few  weeks. The White House has refused to provide these emails in response  to a subpoena.  Mick Mulvaney and Rob Blair refused to comply with the subpoena to  testify. These emails are just a few of the many thousands that likely  exist on this topic but which have been concealed from Congress and the  American people because of ongoing obstruction. In fact, last night, as  we were here late into the night, sometime around midnight, a new  tranche of documents were released under a Freedom of Information Act  request by an independent watchdog that had been asking for them--they  were released last night--between Mr. Duffey and Elaine McCusker, and  others, on the things that I am talking about right now. Unfortunately,  as you can see, there isn't a lot to read here because it is all  blacked out. So, if the President's lawyers contest any of the facts  that I am talking about, you should demand to see the full record. The  American people deserve to see the full truth when it comes to  Presidential actions.  Back to the timeline, from July to September of 2019, the President  and his advisers at the White House and OMB implemented the hold on  Ukraine assistance through an unusual and unlawful process. First, on  July 3, the State Department notified DOD and NSC staff that OMB was  blocking its notification to Congress. According to Jennifer Williams,  Vice President Pence's aide, the hold on this assistance ``came out of  the blue'' because it had not been previously discussed by OMB or NSC.  Around July 12, President Trump directed that a hold be placed on the  DOD security assistance as well. That day, Mr. Blair sent an email to  Duffey at OMB informing him ``that the President is directing a hold on  military support funding for Ukraine.''  Around July 15, Tim Morrison learned from Deputy National Security  Advisor Charles Kupperman ``that it was the President's direction to  hold the assistance.'' Several days later, Duffey and Blair again  exchanged emails about Ukraine's security assistance, and Sandy  testified that, in these [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S464"">Page S464</a>, ] emails, Duffey asked Blair about the reason for the hold. Blair  provided no explanation. Instead, he said: ``We need to let the hold  take place'' and then ``revisit'' the issue with the President.  Between July 18 and July 31, the NSC staff convened several  interagency meetings at which the hold on security assistance was  discussed. Remember those dates: July 18 to July 31. According to Mark  Sandy and other witnesses, several facts emerged. First, the agencies  learned that the President himself had directed the hold through OMB.  Second, no justification or explanation was provided for the hold,  despite repeated questions. Third, except for OMB, all agencies were  supporting military aid because it was in the national security  interests of the United States. And fourth, many were concerned that  the hold was outright illegal.  Ambassador Taylor learned of the hold on July 18. He said the  ``directive had come from the President to the Chief of Staff to OMB''  and that he ``sat in astonishment'' because ``one of the key pillars of  our strong support for Ukraine was threatened.''  David Holmes, a diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, testified that  he was shocked by the hold. Although there was initially some question  as to whether the hold applied to DOD funds, which was already cleared  by Congress, it soon became clear that the hold applied to all $391  million.  Tim Morrison testified that DOD officials raised concerns at a  meeting on July 23 about whether it was ``actually legally permissible  for the President to not allow for the disbursement of the funding.''  These concerns related to possible violations of the Impoundment  Control Act, the law that gives a President the authority to delay or  withhold funds only if Congress is notified of those intentions and  approves the proposed action. Of course, neither of those things had  been done. The issue was escalated quickly, and at a senior-level  meeting on July 26, OMB remained the lone voice for holding the aid.  According to Tim Morrison, OMB said that President Trump was concerned  about corruption in Ukraine. Cooper, from DOD, also attended the July  meeting. She received no further understanding of what was meant by  ``corruption.'' There was never a principals meeting convened on this  issue, but there was a fourth and final interagency meeting on July 31.  Remember that date? A fourth and final one.  There is a process for making sure that U.S. aid money makes it to  the right place, to the right people.  Mr. Chief Justice, I do see a lot of Members moving and taking a  break. Would you like to take a break at this time? I have another,  probably, 15 minutes.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. I think we can continue.    "
227,French Hill,1.4772007465362549,R,hill,hill," Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Nicole  Inman and her great memory, who, over the past many months, was  recognized by her friends, family, and colleagues as a warrior of hope.  Nicole recently lost her courageous battle with cancer. Many across  Arkansas are mourning her passing.  Nicole was the Bryant High School girls' soccer coach, who led the  program to its second Class 6A state championship in May 2019, the same  year she was awarded Coach of the Year by the United Soccer Coaches.  She was more than a coach and a teacher; she was an inspiration on and  off the field.  Nicole's faith was a cornerstone throughout her fight. With her  strong faith in God, she used her illness as an opportunity to minister  and inspire her players and students.  Nicole was also an incredible wife and mother. Her legacy will live  on through her team and her husband, Scott, and their four children:  Garrett, Ashton, Abbey, and Nathan.  She will be missed by her community. I offer prayers for comfort to  her family and condolences. Thank you for sharing her with our  community.    "
228,French Hill,1.4772007465362549,R,hill,hill," Ms. HILL of California. Madam Speaker, this is the last speech that I  will give from this floor as a Member of Congress. I wasn't ready for  my time here to come to an end so soon. It is a reality I am still  grappling with, and I will be for a long time to come.  I expected, or I at least hoped, to be here for as long as the voters  of California's 25th District deemed me worthy of the honor of  representing them. I thought I could make a difference here in making  our community, our great country, and the world a better place for  generations to come.  I, like so many of my colleagues, ran for office because I believed  that our political system was broken, controlled by the powerful and  the wealthy, ignoring and failing the regular people that it is  supposed to serve. I came here to give a voice to the unheard in the  halls of power.  I wanted to show young people, queer people, working people, and  imperfect people that they belong here because this is the people's  House. I fell short of that, and I am sorry.  To every young person who saw themselves and their dreams reflected  in me, I am sorry.  To those who felt like I gave them hope in one of the darkest times  in our Nation's history, I am sorry.  To my family, my friends, my staff, my colleagues, my mentors, and to  everyone who has supported and believed in me, I am sorry.  To the thousands of people who spent hours knocking on doors in the  hot summer Sun, who made countless phone calls, and who sacrificed more  than I could ever know to give everything they could in every possible  way so that I could be here, I am so, so sorry.  And to every little girl who looked up to me, I hope that one day you  can forgive me.  The mistakes I made and the people I have hurt that led to this  moment will haunt me for the rest of my life, and I have to come to  terms with that.  Ever since those images first came out, I barely left my bed. I have  ignored all the calls and the texts. I went [["", Page , H8714, ] to the darkest places that a mind can go, and I have shed more tears  than I thought were possible.  I have hidden from the world because I am terrified of facing the  people that I let down. But I made it through because the people who  loved me most dragged me back into the light and reminded me that I was  stronger than that.  To those of you who were by my side in my worst moments--you know who  you are--I love you. I am so grateful, and I will never forget.  And I am here today because so many of the people I let down--people  close to me, supporters, colleagues, people I have never even met--told  me to stand back up and that, despite all of my faults, they still  believed in me and they were still counting on me. And I realized that  hiding away and disappearing would be the one unforgivable sin.  I will never shirk my responsibility for this sudden ending to my  time here, but I have to say more because this is bigger than me.  I am leaving now because of a double standard.  I am leaving because I no longer want to be used as a bargaining  chip.  I am leaving because I didn't want to be peddled by papers and blogs  and websites, used by shameless operatives for the dirtiest gutter  politics that I have ever seen and the rightwing media to drive clicks  and expand their audience by distributing intimate photos of me taken  without my knowledge, let alone my consent, for the sexual  entertainment of millions.  I am leaving because of a misogynistic culture that gleefully  consumed my naked pictures, capitalized on my sexuality, and enabled my  abusive ex to continue that abuse, this time with the entire country  watching.  I am leaving because of the thousands of vile, threatening emails,  calls, and texts that made me fear for my life and the lives of the  people that I care about.  Today is the first time I have left my apartment since the photos  taken without my consent were released, and I am scared.  I am leaving because, for the sake of my community, my staff, my  family, and myself, I can't allow this to continue, because I have been  told that people were angry when I stood strong after the first article  was posted and that they had hundreds more photos and text messages  that they would release bit by bit until they broke me down to nothing,  while they used my faults and my past to distract from the things that  matter most.  I am leaving because there is only one investigation that deserves  the attention of this country, and that is the one that we voted on  today.  Today, I ask you all to stand with me and commit to creating a future  where this no longer happens to women and girls.  Yes, I am stepping down, but I refuse to let this experience scare  off other women who dare to take risks, who dare to step into this  light, and who dare to be powerful.  It might feel like they have won in the short term, but they can't in  the long term. We cannot let them.  The way to overcome this setback is for women to keep showing up, to  keep running for office, and to keep stepping up as leaders; because  the more we show up, the less power they have.  I am leaving, but we have men who have been credibly accused of  intentional acts of sexual violence and remain in boardrooms, on the  Supreme Court, in this very body, and, worst of all, in the Oval  Office.  So, the fight goes on to create the change that every woman and girl  in this country deserves. Here in the Halls of Congress, the fight will  go on without me.  I trust so many of my colleagues to be strong on this front while I  move on to one of the many other battlefields, because we have an  entire culture that has to change, and we see it in stark clarity  today:  The forces of revenge by a bitter, jealous man, cyber exploitation  and sexual shaming that target our gender, and a large segment of  society that fears and hates powerful women have combined to push a  young woman out of power and say that she doesn't belong here; yet a  man who brags about his sexual predation, who has had dozens of women  come forward to accuse him of sexual assault, who pushes policies that  are uniquely harmful to women, and who has filled the courts with  judges who proudly rule to deprive women of the most fundamental right  to control their own bodies sits in the highest office of the land.  And so today, as my last vote, I voted on impeachment proceedings,  not just because of corruption, obstruction of justice, or gross  misconduct, but because of the deepest abuse of power, including the  abuse of power over women.  Today, as my final act, I voted to move forward with the impeachment  of Donald Trump on behalf of the women of the United States of America.  We will not stand down; we will not be broken; and we will not be  silenced. We will rise, and we will make tomorrow better than today.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time for now, but not  forever.    "
229,French Hill,1.4772007465362549,R,hill,hill," Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table "", H.R. 3401, "", with the Senate amendment thereto, and  concur in this Senate amendment. This bipartisan bill was passed in the  Senate with 84 votes, Madam Speaker, and could be sent today to the  President's desk for his signature.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the Chair has previously advised, the  unanimous consent request cannot be entertained.    "
230,Katie Hill,0.2471904754638672,D,hill,hill," Ms. HILL. Based on questions and statements I have heard,   some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia   and its security services did not conduct a campaign against   our country and that perhaps, somehow for some reason,   Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative being perpetrated   and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.  The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power   that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in   2016. This is the public conclusion of our intelligence   agencies confirmed in bipartisan and congressional reports.   It is beyond dispute, even if some of the underlying details   must remain classified.  The impacts of the successful 2016 Russian campaign remain   evident today. Our Nation is being torn apart. The truth is   questioned. Our highly professional, expert career Foreign   Service is being undermined. U.S. support for Ukraine which   continues to face armed Russian aggression is being   politicized. The Russian Government's goal is to weaken our   country, to diminish America's global role, and to neutralize   a perceived U.S. threat to Russian interests.  Mr. Manager NADLER. President Trump knew this too. His former  Homeland Security Advisor, Tom Bossert, said that the idea that Ukraine  hacked the DNC server was ``not only a conspiracy theory, it is  completely debunked,'' and he and other U.S. officials spent hours with  the President explaining why.  The second false allegation that the President wanted the Ukrainians  to announce was that Vice President Biden used his power to protect a  company on whose board his son sat by forcing the removal of Viktor  Shokin, the corrupt former prosecutor general.  It is true that Vice President Biden helped remove Mr. Shokin, who  was widely believed to be corrupt. As I said a few minutes ago, it was  official policy of the United States, the European community, and  others, in order to fight corruption in Ukraine, to ask that Shokin and  Lutsenko be removed. So the Vice President, Vice President Biden, in  fulfilling U.S. policy, pressured Ukraine to remove Shokin--not to  secure some personal benefit but to advance the official policy of the  United States and its allies. Even Lutsenko, who initially seeded the  allegations against Mr. Biden in American media, later admitted that  the allegations against the Vice President were false. And Rudy  Giuliani told Kurt Volker, the Special Representative for Ukrainian  Negotiations, who had a prominent role in the scheme, that he also knew  the attacks on Joe Biden were a lie.  With Ambassador Yovanovitch out of the way, the first chapter of the  Ukraine scheme was complete. Mr. Giuliani and his agents could now  apply direct pressure to the Ukrainian Government to spread these two  falsehoods.  Who benefited from this scheme? Who sent Mr. Giuliani to Ukraine in  the first place? Of course we could rephrase that question as the  former Republican leader of the Senate, Howard Baker, asked it in 1973:  What did the President know, and when he did he know it?  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, President's  counsel: President Trump and President Zelensky's relationship started  out well. President Trump wanted the two investigations from Zelensky,  and he had no reason to believe he would not get what he wanted.  On April 21, 2019, Volodymyr Zelensky, who was new to politics, won a  landslide victory in Ukraine's Presidential election. That evening,  President Trump called Zelensky to congratulate him. On that first  call--the first call--Zelensky invited President Trump to visit Ukraine  for the upcoming inauguration. President Trump, in turn, promised that  his administration would send someone at ``a very, very high level.''  During that same April call, President Trump invited President  Zelensky to the White House, saying:  When you're settled in and ready, I'd like to invite you to   the White House. We'll have a lot of things to talk about,   but we're with you all the way.  Zelensky immediately accepted the President's invitation, adding that  the ``whole team and I are looking forward to that visit.''  Numerous witnesses testified about the significance of a White House  meeting for the political newcomer. A White House meeting would show  Ukrainians that America supported Zelensky's anti-corruption platform.  The clear backing of the President of the United States--Ukraine's most  important patron--would also send a powerful message to Russia that we  had Ukraine's back.  During that April 21 call, President Trump never even uttered the  word ``corruption,'' but the official White House call recap falsely  stated that the two Presidents had discussed Ukraine's anti-corruption  efforts.  Shortly after the phone call, Jennifer Williams, adviser to Vice  President Pence, learned that President Trump asked Vice President  Pence to attend Zelensky's inauguration.  Williams and her colleagues began planning Pence's trip to Kyiv. At  the same time, Giuliani was trying to get Ukraine to investigate the  Bidens and alleged 2016 election interference. On April 24, Giuliani  went on ``FOX & Friends'' and had this to say:  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Keep your eye on Ukraine, because in Ukraine a lot of dirty   work was done. I'm digging up the information. American   officials were used. Ukrainian officials were used. That is   like collusion with the Ukrainians and--or actually, in this   case, conspiracy with the Ukrainians. I think you'd get some   interesting information about Joe Biden from Ukraine. About   his son, Hunter Biden. About a company he was on the board of   for years, which may be one of the most crooked companies in   Ukraine.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. For this campaign to be truly beneficial  to his boss President Trump, Giuliani needed access to the new  government in Ukraine. He dispatched his associates Lev Parnas and Igor  Fruman to try to make inroads with Zelensky's team.  On April 25, former Vice President Biden publicly announced his bid  for Presidency, and immediately he was at the top of the polls.  That same day, David Holmes, an American diplomat at our Embassy in  Ukraine, learned that Giuliani had reached out to the head of President  Zelensky's campaign. As Mr. Holmes explained, the new Ukrainian  Government began to think that Giuliani [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S460"">Page S460</a>, ] ``was a significant person in terms of managing their relationship with  the United States.''  As Giuliani and his associates worked behind the scenes to get access  to the new leadership in Ukraine, President Trump was publicly  signaling his interest in the investigations. On May 2, the President  appeared on FOX News. When asked, ``Should the former vice president  explain himself on his feeling in Ukraine and whether there was a  conflict . . . with his son's business interests?'' President Trump  replied as follows:  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  I'm hearing it's a major scandal, major problem. Very bad   things happened, and we'll see what that is. They even have   him on tape, talking about it. They have Joe Biden on tape   talking about the prosecutor. And I've seen that tape. A lot   of people are talking about that tape, but that's up to them.   They have to solve that problem.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. The tape President Trump referenced is a  video from January 2018 in which Vice President Biden explained that he  placed an ultimatum to the Ukrainian President to remove the corrupt  prosecutor general to ensure that taxpayer money would be used  appropriately. The Vice President's actions were consistent with  official U.S. policy as well as the opinions of the international  community.  On May 9, the New York Times published an article about Giuliani's  plan to visit Ukraine. In the article, Giuliani confirmed that he  planned to meet with Zelensky. At that meeting, he wanted to press the  Ukrainian Government to pursue the investigations that President Trump  promoted only days earlier. Giuliani said: ``We're not meddling in an  election, we are meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to  do.''  Giuliani even went so far as to acknowledge that his actions could  benefit President Trump personally. He said: ``[T]his isn't foreign  policy--I'm asking them to do an investigation that they're doing  already and that other people are telling them to stop. And I am going  to give them reasons why they shouldn't stop it because that  information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out  to be helpful to my government.''  That is it right there--Giuliani admitting he was asking Ukraine to  work an investigation that would be ``very, very helpful'' to the  President. He was not doing foreign policy. He was not doing this on  behalf of the government. He was doing this for the personal interests  of his client, Donald J. Trump.  The next morning, on May 10, amid coverage of his planned trip to  Ukraine, Giuliani tweeted further about Biden and then had a flurry of  calls with Parnas, who was helping in planning his trip to Ukraine.  That same day, Giuliani also spoke with Ambassador Volker on the  phone for more than 30 minutes. Ambassador Volker had learned that  Giuliani had intended to travel to Ukraine and had called to warn  Giuliani that Prosecutor General Lutsenko ``is not credible. Don't  listen to what he is saying.''  Later that day, Giuliani had a 17-minute call with a masked White  House number before speaking again with Parnas for 12 minutes.  That same day, on May 10, Politico asked President Trump about  Giuliani's upcoming trip, and he replied, ``I have not spoken to him at  any great length, but I will. . . . I will speak to him about it before  he leaves.'' But that evening, on FOX News, Giuliani announced: ``I'm  not going to go'' to Ukraine ``because I think I'm walking into a group  of people that are enemies of the President.'' Separately, in a text  message to ``Politico,'' Giuliani alleged that the original offer for a  meeting with Zelensky was a ``set-up.'' He said it was a set-up  orchestrated by ``several vocal critics'' of President Trump who were  advising Zelensky. Giuliani declared that ``Zelensky is in [the] hands  of avowed enemies of President Trump.''  But Giuliani had not stopped trying. He had Parnas send a letter to  Zelensky's senior aide on May 11 asking for a meeting. That letter made  it clear that Giuliani was representing President Trump as ``a private  citizen'' and that he was working with President Trump's ``knowledge  and consent.''  The letter is on the slide. It reads:  In my capacity as personal counsel to President Trump and   with his knowledge and consent, I request a meeting with you   on this upcoming Monday, May 13, or Tuesday, May 14. I will   need no more than a half-hour of your time and I will be   accompanied by my colleague Victoria Toensing, a   distinguished American attorney who is very familiar with the   matter.  But it did not appear that Giuliani and Parnas's attempts to get the  meeting were working. That same day, Giuliani sent a text message to  Parnas asking, ``This guy is canceling meeting, I think?''  Approximately 3 hours later, Giuliani sent Parnas drafts of a public  statement that ``people advising the PRES ELECT are no friends of the  President.''  Three days later, President Trump instructed Vice President Pence not  to attend the inauguration in Ukraine--just 3 days later. Vice  Presidential staffer Jennifer Williams received a surprising call from  Pence's Chief of Staff. She described it during her public testimony.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  On May 13th, an assistant to the Vice President's chief of   staff called and informed me that President Trump had decided   that the Vice President would not attend the inauguration in   Ukraine. She did not provide any further explanation. I   relayed that instruction to others involved in planning the   potential trip. I also informed the NSC that the Vice   President would not be attending, so that it could identify a   head of delegation to represent the United States at   President-elect Zelensky's inauguration.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Notably, Williams confirmed that the  inauguration date had not yet been scheduled at the time of that phone  call. So the reason for President Trump's decision was certainly not  due to a scheduling conflict.  Secretary of Energy Rick Perry ultimately led the delegation to the  inaugural. Accompanying Secretary Perry were Ambassador to the European  Union, Gordon Sondland; Ambassador Volker; NSC Director for Ukraine,  LTC Alexander Vindman; and Senator Ron Johnson also attended many of  the inaugural events with the delegation. When asked if this delegation  was a good group, Holmes replied that it ``was not as senior a  delegation as we might have expected.''  After the inauguration, Ambassadors Volker and Sondland left Kyiv  with a very favorable impression of President Zelensky. Ambassador  Volker said they believed it was important that President Trump  personally engage with the President of Ukraine in order to demonstrate  full U.S. support for him.  When the inauguration team returned to the United States, they had a  meeting with President Trump on May 23. The May 23 meeting with  President Trump proved to be important for two good reasons. First,  with Ambassador Yovanovitch out of the way, President Trump authorized  Ambassador Sondland, Secretary Perry, and Ambassador Volker to lead  engagement with the new administration in Ukraine; and two, President  Trump instructed them to satisfy Giuliani's concerns in order to move  forward on Ukraine matters.  These officials were all political appointees, and Ambassador  Sondland had donated $1 million to the President's inauguration. The  President saw these three political appointees as officials who would  fulfill his requests.  Ambassador Volker testified that he, Ambassador Sondland, Secretary  Perry, and Senator Johnson took turns making their case that this is a  new crowd. It is a new President in Ukraine. He is committed to doing  the right things, including fighting corruption. They recommended that  President Trump follow through on his invitation for President Zelensky  to meet with him in the Oval Office, but President Trump did not  receive the recommendation well.  At his public hearing, Ambassador Volker described the May 23 Oval  Office meeting with President Trump. Let's listen.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador VOLKER. We stressed our finding that President   Zelensky represented the best chance for getting Ukraine out   of the mire of corruption it had been in for over 20 years.   We urged him [President Trump] to invite President Zelensky   to the White House. The President was very skeptical. Given   Ukraine's history of corruption, that's understandable. He   said that Ukraine was a corrupt country, full of terrible   people. He said, ``They tried to take me down.'' In the   course of that conversation, he referenced conversations with   Mayor Giuliani. It was [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S461"">Page S461</a>, ]  clear to me that despite the positive news and   recommendations being conveyed by this official delegation   about the new President, President Trump had a deeply rooted   negative view on Ukraine rooted in the past. He was receiving   other information from other sources, including Mayor   Giuliani, that was more negative, causing him to retain this   negative view.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Witnesses said the reference to ``taking  me down'' was to unfounded allegations that Ukraine had interfered in  the 2016 election. This was what President Trump considered to be  corruption in Ukraine.  The President's words echoed Giuliani's public statements about  Ukraine in early May. Rather than committing to an Oval Office meeting  with the Ukrainian leader, President Trump directed the delegation to  talk to Giuliani. Here is how Ambassador Sondland described that  instruction from the President.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador SONDLAND. If we wanted to get anything done with   Ukraine, it was apparent to us we needed to talk to Rudy.  GOLDMAN. Right. You understood that Giuliani spoke for the   President, correct?  Ambassador SONDLAND. That's correct.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Ambassador Sondland saw the writing on  the wall. Sondland concluded that if we did not talk to Rudy, nothing  would move forward on Ukraine.  The three amigos, as they called themselves, did as the President  ordered and began talking to Giuliani. Dr. Hill testified Volker,  Sondland, and Perry ``gave us every impression that they were meeting  with Rudy Giuliani at this point, and Rudy Giuliani was also saying on  the television, and indeed had said subsequently, that he was closely  coordinating with the State Department.''  Like Dr. Hill, Ambassador Bolton closely tracked Giuliani's Ukraine- related activities. Hill testified about a conversation she had with  Bolton in May of 2019. That conversation was revealing, so let's  listen.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Dr. HILL. . . . And I had already brought to Ambassador   Bolton's attention the attacks, the smear campaign against   Ambassador Yovanovitch and expressed great regret about how   this was unfolding and, in fact, the shameful way in which   Ambassador Yovanovitch was being smeared and attacked.  And I had asked him if there was anything we could do about   it, and Ambassador Bolton had looked pained, basically   indicated with body language that there was nothing much we   could do about it. And he then in the course of that   discussion said that Rudy Giuliani was a hand grenade that   was going to blow everyone up.  GOLDMAN. Did you understand what he meant by that?  Dr. HILL. I did, actually.  GOLDMAN. What did he mean?  Dr. HILL. Well, I think he meant that obviously what Mr.   Giuliani was saying was pretty explosive, in any case. He was   frequently on television making quite incendiary remarks   about everyone involved in this and that he was clearly   pushing forward issues and ideas that would, you know,   probably come back to haunt us. And, in fact, I think that   that's where we are today.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. According to Dr. Hill's description,  Bolton said that Giuliani's influence could be an obstacle to increased  White House engagement with Ukraine. He instructed his staff not to  meet with Giuliani.  In June, Volker and Sondland relayed to Ambassador Taylor that  President Trump wanted to hear from Zelensky before scheduling the  meeting in the Oval Office. Ambassador Taylor testified that he did not  understand at the time what that meant.  Around this time, the President publicly expressed that he thought it  would be OK to accept foreign interference to assist his campaign if it  was in the form of opposition research on his opponent. Let's listen  to that shocking interview.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  STEPHANOPOULOS. Your campaign this time around, if   foreigners, if Russia, if China, if someone else offers you   information on opponents, should they accept it or should   they call the FBI?  PRESIDENT TRUMP. I think maybe you do both. I think you   might want to listen, there's nothing wrong with listening.   If somebody called from a country, Norway, ``we have   information on your opponent.'' Oh, I think I'd want to hear   it.  STEPHANOPOULOS. You want that kind of interference in our   elections?  PRESIDENT TRUMP. It's not an interference, they have   information. I think I'd take it.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Shocking video. Meanwhile, Giuliani  continued to press Ukraine to do the President's political dirty work.  On June 21, for instance, Giuliani tweeted the following:  New Pres of Ukraine still silent on investigation of   Ukrainian interference in 2016 election and alleged Biden   bribery of Pres Poroshenko. Time for leadership and   investigate both if you want to purge how Ukraine was abused   by Hillary and Obama people.  The quid pro quo scheme was taking shape. Giuliani was publicly  advocating for Ukraine to conduct politically motivated investigations  while President Trump refused to schedule an Oval Office meeting for  Ukraine's new President. As Ambassador Sondland testified, the scheme  to pressure Ukraine to conduct these investigations would only get more  insidious with time.  Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, the majority leader expressed a  preference for a break about 2 hours in. So it is the House managers'  request that I present, and then we take the break, if that is  acceptable for everybody.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Any objection? Move forward.  Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, counsel  for the President, and the American people, where were you on July 25,  2019? It was a Thursday. Members of the U.S. Senate were here in this  Chamber. On July 25, across the Atlantic, our 68,000 troops stationed  throughout Europe were doing what they do every day--training and  preparing to support our allies and defend against Russia.  The professionalism and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform is  a source of great strength, but America is also strong and America is  also secure because we have friends. On July 25, 2019, one of those  friends was a man named Oleksandr Markiv. In a story told by Sabra  Ayers of the Los Angeles Times, Oleksandr was a soldier in the  Ukrainian Army defending his country and Europe against Russian-backed  forces on Ukraine's eastern front. He was in a trench. He was 38 years  old. Oleksandr would later die defending his country during a mortar  attack on his fighting position, giving his life, just like over 13,000  of his fellow Ukrainians, on the frontlines of the fight for liberty in  Europe.  That same Los Angeles Times article painted a picture of what the  Ukrainians were going through during this time.  Tens of thousands of Ukrainians, like Markiv, volunteered to help  fight the Russian-backed separatists in the east. Many of them were  sent to the front line wearing sneakers and without flak jackets and  helmets, let alone rifles and ammunition. Ukrainians across the country  organized in an unprecedented united civil movement not seen since  World War II to raise money to supply their ragtag military with  everything from soldiers' boots to bullets.  And while our friends were at war with Russia wearing sneakers, some  without helmets, something else was happening. On July 25, President  Trump made a phone call. He spoke with Ukrainian President Zelensky and  asked for a favor. On that same day, just hours after his call, his  administration was quietly placing an illegal hold on critical military  aid to support our friends.  So why should any American care about what is happening in Ukraine?  Timothy Morrison, former senior director for Europe and Russia at the  NSC put it bluntly:  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Timothy MORRISON. I continue to believe Ukraine is on the   front lines of a strategic competition between the West and   Vladimir Putin's revanchist Russia. Russia is a failing   power, but it is still a dangerous one. The United States   aids Ukraine and her people so that they can fight Russia   over there, and we don't have to fight Russia here. Support   for Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty has been   a bipartisan objective since Russia's military invasion in   2014. It must continue to be.  Mr. Manager CROW. We help our partner fight Russia over there so we  don't have to fight Russia here--our friends on the frontlines, in  trenches, and with sneakers.  Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, the United States has  stood by Ukraine. Our diplomats and military commanders have long said [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S462"">Page S462</a>, ] that supporting Ukraine makes us safer. But you don't need me to tell  you that; you all know it very well. When the funding for the security  assistance came up for a vote under this roof, 87 of you voted for the  aid.  Many of you have been staunch advocates for Ukraine, working in a  nonpartisan way to support our friends. That support makes a lot of  sense because politics should not play a part in ensuring that Ukraine  can battle Russian aggression and ensure that freedom wins in Europe.  This body has, in so many ways, set that example.  Protecting Europe from Russia is not a political game. Let me provide  some background. In early 2014, in what became known as the Revolution  of Dignity, Ukrainian citizens demanded democratic reforms and an end  to corruption, ousting the pro-Russian President. Within days, Russian  military forces and their proxies invaded Ukraine, annexing Crimea and  occupying portions of eastern Ukraine.  Since 2014, more than 13,000 Ukrainians have been killed because of  the conflict and over 1.4 million have been forced from their homes.  Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the first attempt to redraw Europe's  border since World War II.  In 2017, then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis summed it up well. He  said: ``Despite Russia's denials, we know they are seeking to redraw  international borders by force, undermining the sovereign and free  nations of Europe.''  And as Ambassador Taylor put it, Russian aggression in Ukraine  ``dismissed all the principles that have kept the peace and contributed  to prosperity in Europe since World War II.''  It is clear that Russia is not just a threat in Europe but for  democracy and freedom around the world. Our friends and allies have  also responded, imposing sanctions on Russia and providing billions of  dollars in economic, humanitarian, and security assistance to Ukraine.  This has been an international effort.  Today, the European Union is the single largest contributor of  foreign assistance to Ukraine, having provided roughly $12 billion in  grants and loans since 2014. The United States has provided over $3  billion in assistance in that time, because we all know that we can't  separate our own security from the security of our friends and allies.  That is why the United States has provided economic security and  humanitarian assistance in the form of equipment and training.  Ambassador Taylor testified that American aid is a concrete  demonstration of our ``commitment to resist aggression and defend  freedom.'' He also detailed the many benefits of our assistance for  Ukraine's forces.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Chairman, the security assistance   that we provide takes many forms. One of the components of   that assistance is counter-battery radar. Another component   are sniper weapons.  These weapons and this assistance allows the Ukrainian   military to deter further incursions by the Russians against   their own--against Ukrainian territory. If that further   incursion, further aggression, were to take place, more   Ukrainians would die. So it is a deterrent effect that these   weapons provide.  It's also the ability--it gives the Ukrainians the ability   to negotiate from a position of a little more strength when   they negotiate an end to the war in Donbas, negotiating with   the Russians. This also is a way that would reduce the number   of Ukrainians who would die.  Mr. Manager CROW. I would like to make a finer point of how this type  of aid helps because I know something about counter-battery radar.  In 2005, I was an Army Ranger serving in a special operations task  force in Afghanistan. We were at a remote operating base along the  Afghan-Pakistan border. Frequently, the insurgence that we were  fighting would launch rockets and missiles onto our small base. But,  luckily, we were provided with counter-battery radar. So 20, 30, 40  seconds before those rockets and mortars rained down on us, an alarm  would sound. We would run out from our tents and jump into our concrete  bunkers and wait for the attack to end. This is not a theoretical  exercise, and the Ukrainians know it, for Ukraine aid from the United  States actually constitutes about 10 percent of their military budget.  It is safe to say that they can't fight effectively without it.  So there is no doubt. U.S. military assistance in Ukraine makes a  real difference in the fight against Russia.  In 2019, Congress provided $391 million in security assistance. This  included $250 million through the Department of Defense's Ukraine  Security Assistance Initiative, USAI, and $141 million through the  State Department's Foreign Military Financing Program, FMF.  President Trump signed the bill to authorize this aid in August 2018  and signed another bill to fund it the following month. The aid was  underway. The train was leaving the station and following the same  track it had followed every single year. But all of this was about to  change.  In July of 2019, President Trump ordered the Office of Management and  Budget, OMB, to put a hold on all of the aid. The President personally  made this decision even after his own appointed advisers warned him  that it wasn't in our country's interest to withhold the aid--after  overwhelming support in this Senate--and against longstanding policy,  even in his own administration.  But what is most interesting to me about this is that he was only  interested in the Ukraine aid, nobody else. The United States provides  aid to dozens of countries around the world, lots of partners and  allies. He didn't ask about any of them--just Ukraine.  The most important question here is why would he do that? What was  his motivation? Well, we now know why.  This hold shocked people across our own government. The Department of  Defense, along with the State Department, had already certified to  Congress that Ukraine had implemented sufficient anti-corruption  reforms to get the funds, and the Defense Department had already  notified Congress of its intent to deliver the assistance.  So let's recap all of this. Congress had already funded it. Our own  government had already certified that it met all of the standards that  it met every other year, and Congress had already been notified, just  like every other year.  In a series of meetings of the National Security Agency, everyone  except the OMB supported the provision of the assistance. OMB, as we  know, is headed by Mick Mulvaney, the President's Chief of Staff.  Ukraine experts at DOD, the State Department, and the White House  emphasized that it was in the national security interest of the United  States to continue to support Ukraine in its fight. But it wasn't just  the national security concern, because many people thought that the  hold was just outright illegal. And they were right. It was.  The President's hold did violate the law, because just last week,  Congress's independent, nonpartisan watchdog, the Government  Accountability Office, released an opinion finding that the hold was  illegal.  President Trump held the military aid money for so long that the  administration ran out of time to spend the money. Ultimately, even  after the President lifted the hold on September 11--again, with no  clear explanation why--we, the Congress, had to pass another law to  extend the deadline, delaying the delivery of the aid.  In the same L.A. Times article that told the story about our friend  Mr. Markiv, a Ukrainian defense spokesperson said that even though the  hold had been lifted--this was in September--it ``has not reached us  yet.'' That spokesperson went on to say: ``It is not just money from  the bank. It is arms, equipment and hardware.''  And to this day, millions of dollars still haven't been spent.  Although our government neither informed Ukraine of the hold nor  publicly announced it, Ukraine quickly learned about it.  On July 25, the same day as President Trump's call with President  Zelensky, officials at Ukraine's Embassy here in Washington emailed DOD  to ask about the status of the funding. By mid-August, officials at  DOD, the State Department, and the NSC received numerous questions from  Ukrainian officials about the hold. Everyone was worried. It is not  just because of the urgent need for the equipment on the frontlines but  also because of the message that it sent. You see, President Zelensky  had just been sworn in. They were very vulnerable. And, as we all know,  Vladimir Putin looks for vulnerability. He looks for hesitation. He  looks for delay. And any public sign of a hold on that aid could be a  sign of [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S463"">Page S463</a>, ] weakness that could show him it was time to pounce.  President Trump's hold on Ukraine assistance was eventually publicly  reported on August 28. As we will explain, Ukraine fully understood  that the hold was connected to the investigations that President Trump  wanted.  On February 28, DOD notified Congress that it intended to deliver  $125 million of assistance appropriated in September, including ``more  than $50 million of assistance to deliver counter-artillery radars and  defense lethal assistance.'' Congress cleared the notification, which  enabled DOD to begin spending the funds.  For Ukraine to receive the remaining $125 million, Congress required  that the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of  State, certify that the Government of Ukraine had taken substantial  anti-corruption reforms.  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper and senior  officials across our government conducted a review to evaluate whether  Ukraine had met the required benchmarks.  Ms. Cooper explained that the review involved ``pulling in all the  views of the key experts on Ukraine defense, and coming up with a  consensus view,'' which was then run ``up the chain in the Defense  Department, to ensure we have approval.''  By May 23, the anti-corruption review was complete, and DOD certified  to Congress that Ukraine had complied with all of the conditions and  that the remaining half of the aid should be released. But, again, you  don't have to take my word for it. On May 23, in a letter to Congress,  one of President Trump's senior political appointees, the Under  Secretary of Defense for Policy, wrote: ``On behalf of the Secretary of  Defense, and in coordination with the Secretary of State, I have  certified that the Government of Ukraine has taken substantial actions  to make defense institutional reforms for the purposes of decreasing  corruption, increasing accountability, and sustaining improvements of  combat capability enabled by U.S. assistance.''  Congress then cleared the funding, which should have allowed Ukraine  to receive the aid. But we know that is not what happened.  On June 18, as DOD was preparing to send the aid, they issued a press  release--as they normally do--announcing that it would provide $250  million in security assistance to Ukraine ``for additional training,  equipment, and advisory efforts to build the capacity of Ukraine's  armed forces.'' This included sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenades,  counter-artillery radars, command and control, electronic warfare,  secure communications, vehicles, night vision, and medical  equipment. However, according to the New York Times, 1 day after the  Defense Department issued this press release--1 day--Assistant to the  President Robert Blair, who works for Mick Mulvaney, called OMB Acting  Director Russell Vought to tell him: ``We need to hold it up.'' The  ``it'' was the assistance.  That same day, June 19, President Trump gave an interview on FOX News  where he raised the so-called CrowdStrike conspiracy theory that  Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 2016 election, a line he  would echo during his July 25 call with President Zelensky. This  theory, by the way, has been advanced by Russian propaganda to try to  take attention away from Russian interference and shift it onto  Ukraine. It is a theory that has been universally debunked by U.S.  intelligence and law enforcement.  Nonetheless, the President, spurred by the June 18 press release and  with the false theory about the Ukraine interference, supposedly, in  the 2016 election, started asking about the Ukraine assistance. On June  19, OMB Associate Director for National Security Michael Duffey emailed  Elaine McCusker, the DOD comptroller. He said the President had  questions about the press report and that he was seeking additional  information. This was a reference to an article in the Washington  Examiner, shown here on the slide in front of you.  The White House withheld this email from the House, of course. We  first learned of it from Duffey's deputy, Mark Sandy, who testified  that he was copied on it. Subsequently, as a result of a lawsuit under  the Freedom of Information Act, the public and, therefore, Congress  received a copy of that email, but the White House still refuses to  comply with the subpoenas for this and other documents.  On June 20, McCusker responded to President Trump's inquiry by  providing Sandy information on the security assistance program. Sandy  shared the information with Duffey, but he did not know whether Duffey  shared the information with the White House. Laura Cooper also recalled  receiving an email inquiry about Ukraine's security assistance ``a few  days'' after DOD's June 18 press release. She noted that it was  ``relatively unusual'' to receive questions from the President. In  response, DOD provided materials explaining that the $250 million  funding package was for additional training, equipment, and advisory  efforts to build the capacity of Ukraine's Armed Forces. DOD emphasized  that ``almost all of the dozens of vendors are U.S. companies,''  meaning that this funding also benefited U.S. businesses and workers.  Nonetheless, President Trump put the wheels in motion to freeze the  funds shortly after learning about DOD's plan to release the funds.  According to a New York Times article on June 27, Chief of Staff  Mulvaney emailed Blair:  I am just trying to tie up some loose ends. Did we ever   find out about the money from Ukraine and whether we can hold   it back?  Blair reportedly responded that it would be possible but not pretty.  He added: ``Expect Congress to become unhinged.'' I suppose he said  that for all the reasons we have talked about earlier, because this  Chamber and our Chamber on the other side of the Capitol resoundingly  supports it.  And that was just the Defense Department assistance to Ukraine. For  2019, Congress also appropriated $141 million to Ukraine through the  State Department. Unlike the Defense Department funding, which was  approved by Congress and ready to be spent, OMB blocked the State  Department from even seeking Congress's approval to release the funds.  I am going to pause here to, once again, stress that we have learned  a lot about the circumstances around the initial hold only from the  public release of and reporting about these emails in the past few  weeks. The White House has refused to provide these emails in response  to a subpoena.  Mick Mulvaney and Rob Blair refused to comply with the subpoena to  testify. These emails are just a few of the many thousands that likely  exist on this topic but which have been concealed from Congress and the  American people because of ongoing obstruction. In fact, last night, as  we were here late into the night, sometime around midnight, a new  tranche of documents were released under a Freedom of Information Act  request by an independent watchdog that had been asking for them--they  were released last night--between Mr. Duffey and Elaine McCusker, and  others, on the things that I am talking about right now. Unfortunately,  as you can see, there isn't a lot to read here because it is all  blacked out. So, if the President's lawyers contest any of the facts  that I am talking about, you should demand to see the full record. The  American people deserve to see the full truth when it comes to  Presidential actions.  Back to the timeline, from July to September of 2019, the President  and his advisers at the White House and OMB implemented the hold on  Ukraine assistance through an unusual and unlawful process. First, on  July 3, the State Department notified DOD and NSC staff that OMB was  blocking its notification to Congress. According to Jennifer Williams,  Vice President Pence's aide, the hold on this assistance ``came out of  the blue'' because it had not been previously discussed by OMB or NSC.  Around July 12, President Trump directed that a hold be placed on the  DOD security assistance as well. That day, Mr. Blair sent an email to  Duffey at OMB informing him ``that the President is directing a hold on  military support funding for Ukraine.''  Around July 15, Tim Morrison learned from Deputy National Security  Advisor Charles Kupperman ``that it was the President's direction to  hold the assistance.'' Several days later, Duffey and Blair again  exchanged emails about Ukraine's security assistance, and Sandy  testified that, in these [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S464"">Page S464</a>, ] emails, Duffey asked Blair about the reason for the hold. Blair  provided no explanation. Instead, he said: ``We need to let the hold  take place'' and then ``revisit'' the issue with the President.  Between July 18 and July 31, the NSC staff convened several  interagency meetings at which the hold on security assistance was  discussed. Remember those dates: July 18 to July 31. According to Mark  Sandy and other witnesses, several facts emerged. First, the agencies  learned that the President himself had directed the hold through OMB.  Second, no justification or explanation was provided for the hold,  despite repeated questions. Third, except for OMB, all agencies were  supporting military aid because it was in the national security  interests of the United States. And fourth, many were concerned that  the hold was outright illegal.  Ambassador Taylor learned of the hold on July 18. He said the  ``directive had come from the President to the Chief of Staff to OMB''  and that he ``sat in astonishment'' because ``one of the key pillars of  our strong support for Ukraine was threatened.''  David Holmes, a diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, testified that  he was shocked by the hold. Although there was initially some question  as to whether the hold applied to DOD funds, which was already cleared  by Congress, it soon became clear that the hold applied to all $391  million.  Tim Morrison testified that DOD officials raised concerns at a  meeting on July 23 about whether it was ``actually legally permissible  for the President to not allow for the disbursement of the funding.''  These concerns related to possible violations of the Impoundment  Control Act, the law that gives a President the authority to delay or  withhold funds only if Congress is notified of those intentions and  approves the proposed action. Of course, neither of those things had  been done. The issue was escalated quickly, and at a senior-level  meeting on July 26, OMB remained the lone voice for holding the aid.  According to Tim Morrison, OMB said that President Trump was concerned  about corruption in Ukraine. Cooper, from DOD, also attended the July  meeting. She received no further understanding of what was meant by  ``corruption.'' There was never a principals meeting convened on this  issue, but there was a fourth and final interagency meeting on July 31.  Remember that date? A fourth and final one.  There is a process for making sure that U.S. aid money makes it to  the right place, to the right people.  Mr. Chief Justice, I do see a lot of Members moving and taking a  break. Would you like to take a break at this time? I have another,  probably, 15 minutes.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. I think we can continue.    "
231,Katie Hill,0.2471904754638672,D,hill,hill," Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Nicole  Inman and her great memory, who, over the past many months, was  recognized by her friends, family, and colleagues as a warrior of hope.  Nicole recently lost her courageous battle with cancer. Many across  Arkansas are mourning her passing.  Nicole was the Bryant High School girls' soccer coach, who led the  program to its second Class 6A state championship in May 2019, the same  year she was awarded Coach of the Year by the United Soccer Coaches.  She was more than a coach and a teacher; she was an inspiration on and  off the field.  Nicole's faith was a cornerstone throughout her fight. With her  strong faith in God, she used her illness as an opportunity to minister  and inspire her players and students.  Nicole was also an incredible wife and mother. Her legacy will live  on through her team and her husband, Scott, and their four children:  Garrett, Ashton, Abbey, and Nathan.  She will be missed by her community. I offer prayers for comfort to  her family and condolences. Thank you for sharing her with our  community.    "
232,Katie Hill,0.2471904754638672,D,hill,hill," Ms. HILL of California. Madam Speaker, this is the last speech that I  will give from this floor as a Member of Congress. I wasn't ready for  my time here to come to an end so soon. It is a reality I am still  grappling with, and I will be for a long time to come.  I expected, or I at least hoped, to be here for as long as the voters  of California's 25th District deemed me worthy of the honor of  representing them. I thought I could make a difference here in making  our community, our great country, and the world a better place for  generations to come.  I, like so many of my colleagues, ran for office because I believed  that our political system was broken, controlled by the powerful and  the wealthy, ignoring and failing the regular people that it is  supposed to serve. I came here to give a voice to the unheard in the  halls of power.  I wanted to show young people, queer people, working people, and  imperfect people that they belong here because this is the people's  House. I fell short of that, and I am sorry.  To every young person who saw themselves and their dreams reflected  in me, I am sorry.  To those who felt like I gave them hope in one of the darkest times  in our Nation's history, I am sorry.  To my family, my friends, my staff, my colleagues, my mentors, and to  everyone who has supported and believed in me, I am sorry.  To the thousands of people who spent hours knocking on doors in the  hot summer Sun, who made countless phone calls, and who sacrificed more  than I could ever know to give everything they could in every possible  way so that I could be here, I am so, so sorry.  And to every little girl who looked up to me, I hope that one day you  can forgive me.  The mistakes I made and the people I have hurt that led to this  moment will haunt me for the rest of my life, and I have to come to  terms with that.  Ever since those images first came out, I barely left my bed. I have  ignored all the calls and the texts. I went [["", Page , H8714, ] to the darkest places that a mind can go, and I have shed more tears  than I thought were possible.  I have hidden from the world because I am terrified of facing the  people that I let down. But I made it through because the people who  loved me most dragged me back into the light and reminded me that I was  stronger than that.  To those of you who were by my side in my worst moments--you know who  you are--I love you. I am so grateful, and I will never forget.  And I am here today because so many of the people I let down--people  close to me, supporters, colleagues, people I have never even met--told  me to stand back up and that, despite all of my faults, they still  believed in me and they were still counting on me. And I realized that  hiding away and disappearing would be the one unforgivable sin.  I will never shirk my responsibility for this sudden ending to my  time here, but I have to say more because this is bigger than me.  I am leaving now because of a double standard.  I am leaving because I no longer want to be used as a bargaining  chip.  I am leaving because I didn't want to be peddled by papers and blogs  and websites, used by shameless operatives for the dirtiest gutter  politics that I have ever seen and the rightwing media to drive clicks  and expand their audience by distributing intimate photos of me taken  without my knowledge, let alone my consent, for the sexual  entertainment of millions.  I am leaving because of a misogynistic culture that gleefully  consumed my naked pictures, capitalized on my sexuality, and enabled my  abusive ex to continue that abuse, this time with the entire country  watching.  I am leaving because of the thousands of vile, threatening emails,  calls, and texts that made me fear for my life and the lives of the  people that I care about.  Today is the first time I have left my apartment since the photos  taken without my consent were released, and I am scared.  I am leaving because, for the sake of my community, my staff, my  family, and myself, I can't allow this to continue, because I have been  told that people were angry when I stood strong after the first article  was posted and that they had hundreds more photos and text messages  that they would release bit by bit until they broke me down to nothing,  while they used my faults and my past to distract from the things that  matter most.  I am leaving because there is only one investigation that deserves  the attention of this country, and that is the one that we voted on  today.  Today, I ask you all to stand with me and commit to creating a future  where this no longer happens to women and girls.  Yes, I am stepping down, but I refuse to let this experience scare  off other women who dare to take risks, who dare to step into this  light, and who dare to be powerful.  It might feel like they have won in the short term, but they can't in  the long term. We cannot let them.  The way to overcome this setback is for women to keep showing up, to  keep running for office, and to keep stepping up as leaders; because  the more we show up, the less power they have.  I am leaving, but we have men who have been credibly accused of  intentional acts of sexual violence and remain in boardrooms, on the  Supreme Court, in this very body, and, worst of all, in the Oval  Office.  So, the fight goes on to create the change that every woman and girl  in this country deserves. Here in the Halls of Congress, the fight will  go on without me.  I trust so many of my colleagues to be strong on this front while I  move on to one of the many other battlefields, because we have an  entire culture that has to change, and we see it in stark clarity  today:  The forces of revenge by a bitter, jealous man, cyber exploitation  and sexual shaming that target our gender, and a large segment of  society that fears and hates powerful women have combined to push a  young woman out of power and say that she doesn't belong here; yet a  man who brags about his sexual predation, who has had dozens of women  come forward to accuse him of sexual assault, who pushes policies that  are uniquely harmful to women, and who has filled the courts with  judges who proudly rule to deprive women of the most fundamental right  to control their own bodies sits in the highest office of the land.  And so today, as my last vote, I voted on impeachment proceedings,  not just because of corruption, obstruction of justice, or gross  misconduct, but because of the deepest abuse of power, including the  abuse of power over women.  Today, as my final act, I voted to move forward with the impeachment  of Donald Trump on behalf of the women of the United States of America.  We will not stand down; we will not be broken; and we will not be  silenced. We will rise, and we will make tomorrow better than today.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time for now, but not  forever.    "
233,Katie Hill,0.2471904754638672,D,hill,hill," Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table "", H.R. 3401, "", with the Senate amendment thereto, and  concur in this Senate amendment. This bipartisan bill was passed in the  Senate with 84 votes, Madam Speaker, and could be sent today to the  President's desk for his signature.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the Chair has previously advised, the  unanimous consent request cannot be entertained.    "
234,James Himes,1.350319504737854,D,himes,himes," Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Gallego, for  yielding.  I rise in strong support of "", H.R. 5852, "".  Weir Farm is a magnificent jewel that resides in the middle of my  district.  I should say at the outset, my district is actually smaller than a  great number of the national park assets in this country, and so much  of the agriculture that used to characterize southwestern Connecticut,  of course, has given way to urban environments and to suburban  environments. As a consequence, this 70 acres of land is truly a jewel  inside Connecticut's Fourth District and inside Fairfield County,  Connecticut.  The Weir Farm National Historic Site stretches across just 70 acres  of land, but in those 70 acres, there are any number of historical  buildings, a vast collection of American art, orchards and landscapes,  trails, gardens, miles of stone walls, and Weir Pond, as well as over  250 historic painting sites.  Sometimes people don't remember--though I appreciate my colleagues  today reminding everyone--that southwestern Connecticut has a long  tradition of the production of American art, including Childe Hassam,  who resided in my own town of Cos Cob, Connecticut.  But this particular national historical site, soon to become a  national historical park, offers an opportunity, in particular, to the  children who live in Stamford, Connecticut; Norwalk, Connecticut; and  Bridgeport, Connecticut, cities that actually do have some meaningful  poverty and in which children don't have a lot of opportunities to come  face-to-face with their history, face-to-face with art, and face-to- face with our agricultural heritage, to actually see and touch these  things.  It is a really wonderful location in the middle of Fairfield County,  Connecticut, and this redesignation will capture the full breadth and  the full comprehensive set of offerings that the Weir Farm National  Historical Park will continue to offer the people of Connecticut and,  quite frankly, the people of the United States.  The park's designation today fails to represent everything that the  farm offers, including the remarkable youth programs that I referred to  earlier, where organizations like Groundwork Bridgeport have partnered  with Weir Farm to provide young people with opportunities that they  might not otherwise have.  Before I close, Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Chairwoman  Haaland, Chairman Grijalva of the subcommittee, Ranking Member Bishop,  and Representative Young for working on this piece of legislation.  I thank the Friends of Weir Farm, including Elizabeth Castagna and  Judy Wander, who have pushed this very hard, and the hardworking men  and women at Weir Farm, including Linda Cook, the superintendent.  Finally, I thank my colleague, Senator Murphy, who will be seeing  that this bill moves expeditiously through the United States Senate.  I also thank, again, my friend, Mr. Gallego.    "
235,George Holding,0.06958094984292984,R,holding,holding," Mr. HOLDING. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, one thing that I think has become abundantly clear  during this pandemic is how important it is to incentivize  biopharmaceutical innovation. Over the past few months, Federal  officials worked tirelessly with drug companies to identify and develop  treatments that can help mitigate the effects of the coronavirus-- indeed, save thousands of lives.  In my district, the town of Wilson, North Carolina, is home to one of  the three manufacturing sites that produce over 40 percent of the  world's supply of dexamethasone, which has been identified as one of  the first lifesaving drugs for coronavirus patients. This site in  Wilson is preparing to ramp up production and meet global demands.  Madam Speaker, to effectively fight this pandemic, policymakers must  continue working with healthcare stakeholders to spur innovation and  ensure a steady supply of vital drugs to treat the coronavirus.  Madam Speaker, unfortunately, we are wasting time today talking about  government price controls that would do the exact opposite. Rather than  incentivize the development of a vaccine and new and innovative  treatments, these price-setting proposals will discourage companies  from investing in new drugs, and the tax penalty for noncompliance  threatens to force companies and certain drugs out of the United States  entirely.  That not only means that thousands of Americans could lose access to  the drugs they desperately need, but thousands of folks in towns like  Wilson could lose their jobs as companies leave the United States.  Madam Speaker, under no circumstances--no circumstances--can we adopt  a policy that will curtail patient access to vital drugs and discourage  the development of new, innovative treatments. Even the development of  one less drug as a result of this policy is too many in the middle of a  pandemic.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this misguided  bill.    "
236,Trey Hollingsworth,0.07952108979225159,R,hollingsworth,hollingsworth," Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Madam Speaker, Thomas Lavell Secrest passed away  this week after a life full of service to his country.  Tom was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, and attended the U.S. Military  Academy at West Point from 1966 to 1970. After graduation, Tom served  in Germany and Fort Knox, achieving the rank of captain, as a tanker.  Tom is remembered by his West Point classmates as a smart and kind guy.  After his service in the Army, Tom returned to Texas to attend law  school at the University of Texas and then went on to a very successful  legal career in New York City. Over his career, Tom represented  Polaroid, AT&T, Lucent, and Hunter Douglas in defending their  intellectual property. Tom's demand for uncompromised performance was  evident in every pursuit of his life: academic, military, professional,  and personal.  Tom spent the last few years of his life in South Carolina with his  beloved wife, Liz, where they enjoyed their mutual passion for golf.  Throughout their marriage, they also ensured that their friends, their  family could participate in their love for golf, including Golf  Magazine's editor-in-chief, George Peper.  In 2002, George highlighted his friend Tom's spirit both on and off  the golf course in an article that tells you exactly who he was: an  ardent believer in hard work, a fiercely loyal friend, husband, and  father. He was someone who never missed an opportunity to hit the  links. And while always staying humble, Tom's golf game was legendary.  A golfer once said that many golfers argue very frequently, very  vigorously about where they played or which course was the best; but,  at the end of their lives, what they will remember is with whom they  played. Tom truly embodied this by always remembering it was with whom  you played that mattered most. He played with his favorite friends, his  family.  He is survived by his wife, his son, his daughter-in-law, his  brothers, his nieces, his nephews, and his grandchildren. I know each  of them will miss him dearly but will carry on the legacy of  earnestness and humor that he instilled in each of them.  Tom is someone whom those around him could always rely on, but he was  taken from us far too son. Our country and his family are better off  because of his life, because of his service, and because of his spirit.  Madam Speaker, may Tom rest in peace.    "
237,Steven Horsford,0.3120384216308594,D,horsford,horsford," Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, this global pandemic has devastated  Nevada's economy, forcing thousands of Nevadans to be laid off from  work.  Nevada's unemployment rate was last reported to be 11.8 percent. My  hometown of North Las Vegas reported the State's highest unemployment  rate at 14.6 percent.  Nevada's families are hurting.  Constituents contact my office every single day about their  unemployment insurance concerns, especially regarding the Federal  unemployment compensation benefits which expire at the end of this  month.  Now that this pandemic is ravaging our country again, many States and  localities are considering more stay-at-home orders.  We in Congress must act to make sure Americans who are unable to work  because of this virus receive the Federal unemployment compensation  that they need to survive until we get a vaccine that is free and  available to everyone.  It is my hope that any COVID relief package that becomes law provides  extended unemployment insurance benefits, direct cash payments, and  additional State and local funding so that we can provide support to  people who need it the most.    "

Madam Speaker, Pennsylvania, like the rest of the  country, is in the midst of both a public health and an economic  crisis. This clearly isn't news to anyone. We have been here for months  now.  My community--the people whom I represent--are looking to us--the  people whom they just cast ballots for--to comprehensively address this  crisis. No matter which side of the aisle that you are on, Madam  Speaker, we have a collective responsibility to address the COVID  pandemic from both the public health and economic perspective.  I have been in my community talking to small business owners.  Hardworking Pennsylvanians need Federal support to weather this crisis.  An economic recovery cannot ignore the needs of our small businesses.  That is not recovery at all.  We need to pass my Paycheck Protection Small Business Forgiveness Act  to expedite forgiveness for Paycheck Protection Program loans for less  than $150,000, which accounts for more than 90 percent of PPP borrowers  across the country. [["", Page , H5863, ]  This pandemic has taken lives and livelihoods from so many  Pennsylvanians. We have the opportunity here to contain this virus and  reverse this economic fallout. I urge the passage of the Paycheck  Protection Small Business Forgiveness Act.    "

240,Richard Hudson,0.14114992320537567,R,hudson,hudson," Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my friend and  my colleague, Congressman Greg Walden, on his retirement, following  more than 20 years representing Oregon's Second District here in  Congress.  As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Chairman Walden has  been a real mentor to me. I have seen firsthand Chairman Walden's love  for his country, dedication to his district, and hard work on so many  important priorities for our Nation, like healthcare, energy  independence, and telecommunications.  I have so many fond memories of the work we have done together and  the time we have spent. I especially enjoyed working with Chairman  Walden on "", H.R. 6, ', landmark legislation to combat the opioid crisis.  Chairman Walden, you will be dearly missed, but I wish you, Mylene,  Anthony, and your entire family all the best.  I urge my colleagues to join me in thanking Congressman Greg Walden  for his extraordinary service.    "
241,Jared Huffman,1.8205643892288208,D,huffman,huffman," Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to one of  the many important provisions of today's legislation. In particular, I  rise to discuss Section 1109 of Title XI of Division FF, relating to  aquatic ecosystem protection, which comes from the FUTURE Western Water  Infrastructure and Drought Resiliency title that I authored in "", H.R. 2, ""  earlier this year.  Today's provision is an improved version of that legislation, and it  is the result of the ongoing bicameral water infrastructure  negotiations between the committees of jurisdiction. I am grateful for  the work done on both sides of the Capitol and both sides of the aisle  to bring this to fruition. This aquatic ecosystem protection provision  is designed to fund broadly-supported fish passage projects in the  western states, and the specific intent is to help projects like the  one in the Eel and Russian River basins in California, where we have a  chance to significantly improve fish passage and habitat on the Eel  River while providing long term certainty and reliability for Russian  River water users.  The Potter Valley Project Ad Hoc Committee has been refining this  effort for several years, and we now have a Two-Basin Partnership that  is taking the next steps. The intent of this new aquatic ecosystem  protection statute is to support the important work of the Two-Basin  Partnership, as well as other community-supported restoration projects  like it around the west.  I am including in the Record letters of support from the Round Valley  Indian Tribes, Humboldt County, Sonoma County Water Agency, Mendocino  County Inland Water and Power Commission, and California Trout-- collectively known as the Two-Basin Partnership--as well as from the  Nature Conservancy, Trout Unlimited, and California Trout--collectively  known as the California Salmon and Steelhead Coalition.  I thank my colleagues for working with me to bring this legislation  to fruition, and thank the staff in both the House and Senate who have  helped in this effort, especially Matthew Muirragui from the House  Natural Resources Committee and John Driscoll, Logan Ferree, and Ben  Miller on my personal staff. I look forward to working with the next  administration to support this win-win outcome for the North Coast and  North Bay. "

Mr. Speaker, having this updated information will help  us analyze and assess the threats facing the Great Lakes and allow us  to be more proactive instead of 100 percent reactive.  The Great Lakes are a way of life for many of us in west Michigan and  throughout the Great Lakes system, and these pristine resources help  define who we are as a community and a people. I will continue to work,  support, and advocate for commonsense reforms like today's legislation  that will protect these incredible natural resources for generations to  come.  I do want to thank my fellow colleagues who have been working on  this, Mr. Kildee from Michigan, Mr. Joyce from Ohio, and the rest of  the Great Lakes Task Force. This has been a great, true bipartisan  success story, as we have looked at increasing funding for protecting  the Great Lakes through the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, the  GLRI, as well as initiatives like this.

For decades, American leadership in emerging technologies has created  prosperity and security across the world, but this leadership is no  longer guaranteed. As the Chinese Communist Party continues to use any  means possible to become the next world power and world's leader in AI,  it is all the more vital that the U.S. have our own strategic plan.  For almost a year, Representative Robin Kelly and I worked with  policy experts, stakeholders, and the Bipartisan Policy Center to  develop guidelines that will prepare America's workforce, counter our  adversaries, promote research and development, and shape the ethics of  AI based on America's values.  This resolution outlines specific steps and actions the Federal  Government should take to ensure our global leadership in this emerging  technology. If we don't take advantage of AI, Mandarin and the yuan-- not English and the dollar--could dominate the global economy.  Vladimir Putin once said that whoever masters AI will master the  world. That is why America--not Russia and not China--must be at the  helm.  I came to Congress to make our Nation safer, and I am proud one of my  last pieces of legislation before this body will do just that.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, Robin Kelly, for  partnering with me on this critical effort and our staffs for making  this happen. I hope all of our colleagues will join us in supporting  this resolution.    "
246,Christopher Jacobs,0.019880272448062897,R,jacobs,jacobs," Mr. JACOBS. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Water Resources  Development Act, which is critical to districts with significant  shorelines, like mine.  I am especially pleased to see the Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency  Study included in this bill. High water levels on Lake Erie, and  especially on Lake Ontario, are a major concern to communities in our  region. Homeowners and business owners along Lake Ontario have suffered  significant flooding and devastating property damage over the last few  years. This study will inform those projects and policies that will  mitigate high water levels and, hopefully, prevent future flooding of  the kind suffered recently.  I would also like to thank our leaders in the House, Ranking Member  Sam Graves and Chairman Peter DeFazio, for the bipartisan work they  have done on this legislation. The bipartisan work in the committee on  WRDA is always welcome and a strong example of the way business can be  conducted here.

248,Hakeem Jeffries,2.6289241313934326,D,jeffries,jeffries," Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to condemn the treacherous  and seditious behavior of some in this Nation who continue to poison  the integrity of our democracy.  The voters have spoken. The recounts have spoken. The electoral  college has spoken. Joe Biden will be the 46th President of the United  States of America. Over 80 million people voted for Joe Biden--more  than any other Presidential candidate in American history.  Joe Biden won blue States, like New York and California.  Joe Biden won swing States like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and  Wisconsin.  Joe Biden won red States, like Georgia and Arizona.  Joe Biden is the next President of the United States of America.  And yet there are some in this country who continue to peddle wild  conspiracy theories without a shred of evidence:  The Republican Governor of Georgia found no evidence of voter fraud.  The Republican Governor of Arizona--no evidence of voter fraud.  The Republican-led FBI found no evidence of voter fraud.  The Republican-led Department of Justice found no evidence of voter  fraud.  Republican-appointed judges throughout the country have found no  evidence of voter fraud.  The Republican Attorney General, Bill Barr, found no evidence of  voter fraud.  The Supreme Court, with six Republican-appointed Justices dismissed  the baseless lawsuit that contained not a shred of evidence of voter  fraud.  Madam Speaker, Joe Biden was duly-elected as the next President of  the United States of America, and yet there are some in this Nation who  are behaving like members of the Jefferson Davis Caucus, including a  former Member of this Chamber, who suggested that Texas secede.  Madam Speaker, it is time to respect the Constitution.  It is time to respect our democracy.  It is time to respect the voters.  It is time to respect the rule of law.  It is time to respect the peaceful transfer of power. [[', Page , H7167, ]  It is time to end this charade.  It is time to stop providing aid and comfort to an insurrection.

249,Bill Johnson,0.09144924581050873,R,johnson,johnson," Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to ask the Senate to confirm  Mr. Chad Wolf to be the Under Secretary of the Office of Strategy,  Policy, and Plans at the Department of Homeland Security.  The Under Secretary of the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans  leads an office of over 150 employees with an annual budget of over $37  million to develop and implement DHS policy, long-term goals, and  strategic plans. Chad Wolf has extensive experience in homeland  security policy, starting in 2002 working as the chief of staff helping  to stand up the new Transportation Security Administration after 9/11  and then as the Assistant Administrator for that agency.  He left government and spent over a decade working on homeland  security policy issues as a consultant in the private sector. Mr. Wolf  returned to public service and the Department of Homeland Security in  2017, serving as chief of staff at TSA, chief of staff to the  Secretary, and now as the Assistant Secretary of Strategy, Plans,  Analysis & Risk. Since February of this year, he has been the senior  official performing the duties of the Under Secretary of the Office of  Strategy, Policy, and Plans, the office for which we are now  considering his nomination.  The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  approved his nomination on a bipartisan basis on July 24. As we all  know, the Department has a number of Senate-confirmed leadership  positions vacant. Currently, 7 of the 18 DHS offices requiring Senate  confirmation are vacant. Three of those vacant positions have nominees  that have been languishing on the Senate floor for months after being  approved by my committee with bipartisan support.  Mr. Wolf's nomination has been pending in the Senate for almost 9  months. Troy Edgar, the nominee to be the Department's Chief Financial  Officer, has been pending in the Senate for 8 months, and William  Bryan, the nominee to be Under Secretary for Science and Technology,  has been pending for over 4 months. All three nominees were approved by  my committee with bipartisan support. We are holding a hearing to  consider Mr. Peter Gaynor as the President's nominee to head FEMA this  week.  Dedicated Americans serving at DHS in acting positions are doing  admirable jobs under oftentimes difficult circumstances. I trust that  Chad Wolf will do the same if he is asked to step aside from his role  as Under Secretary to serve temporarily as Acting Secretary upon Kevin  McAleenan's departure.  I fully expect and I call upon the President to nominate a permanent  Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security. When he does, my  committee will consider the nominee expeditiously. We need confirmed  leadership at DHS to help direct the Department as it works to keep  Americans safe.  We need confirmed leadership at DHS to help direct the Department as  it works to keep Americans safe. I am grateful to Chad Wolf for his  willingness to serve in this position, and I encourage my colleagues to  support his confirmation.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    "
250,Bill Johnson,0.09144924581050873,R,johnson,johnson," Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support House  passage of "", S. 1694, "", the ``One Small Step to Protect Human Heritage in  Space Act.''  I want to thank Senator Peters and Senator Cruz for initiating this  legislation in the Senate. I also want to extend my appreciation to  House Science Committee Ranking Member Lucas, and Space and Aeronautics  Subcommittee Chairwoman Horn and Ranking Member Babin for joining me in  cosponsoring the House companion bill. We all share the goal of  protecting human heritage in space, and it is fitting that we are  working together to seek passage of the ``One Small Step'' legislation.  More than 50 years ago, the world watched in awe as Neil Armstrong  and Buzz Aldrin landed on the lunar surface and became the first humans  to set foot on another planetary body. Prior to their successful  landing, NASA implemented a series of tests, including robotic landings  and human in-space test programs in preparation for the Apollo human  landings. The culmination of those precursor efforts resulted in the  safe and successful Apollo 11 lunar landing, a moment that changed the  course of humanity.  Apollo human landing missions explored a total of 6 sites on the  Moon, leaving indicators of human presence, including rover tracks,  footprints, and scientific experiments and spacecraft hardware, among  other lunar landing site artifacts. Those artifacts that remain  imprinted in the lunar dust and on the surface of the Moon are  cultural, historic, scientific, and archeological artifacts. The bill  we are considering today, the ``One Small Step to Protect Human  Heritage in Space Act,'' directs the NASA Administrator to take  important actions toward preserving those artifacts.  The United States led the way in lunar exploration with humans and we  must also lead the way in setting examples and guiding responsible  behaviors in outer space, including behaviors related to our lunar  landing site artifacts. Congress and the American taxpayers made  possible the United States' historic and momentous Apollo lunar  landings by authorizing the program and investing four percent of the  nation's federal spending at the time to successfully carry it out. It  is incumbent upon the House of Representatives to honor these historic  lunar artifacts and to honor America's investment and commitment to  making the Apollo program a success. The direction in the One Small  Step bill will put into law our commitment toward preserving America's  human heritage in space.  Apollo remains an inspiration; it brought the world together during a  period of unique challenges and resulted in long-lasting benefits to  Americans. As we plan and prepare to send Americans into deep space  once again, and as other nations and actors become increasingly capable  of lunar activity, honoring and preserving Apollo's historic and  cultural significance must be prioritized. In doing so, we celebrate  American ingenuity and the awe-inspiring, humanity-changing  achievements of which we are capable.  In closing, I want to also extend my support of "", S. 2472, "", the ``Neil  A. Armstrong Test Facility Act'' to honor an American hero in our space  program. I urge my colleagues to support passage of both "", S. 1694, "", the  ``One Small Step Act'' and "", S. 2472, "", ``the Neil A. Armstrong Test  Facility Act.''  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms. Kendra S. Horn) that the House suspend  the rules and pass the bill, "", S. 1694, "", as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to require  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to add  recommendations and inform other relevant agencies of information  relating to the principle of due regard and the limitation of harmful  interference with Apollo landing site artifacts, and for other  purposes.''.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "

Mr. Speaker, "", H.R. 8235, ' is a bill that will make a meaningful  difference in the accessibility and transparency of an entire branch of  the Federal Government. It vindicates our critical First Amendment  rights and it will establish a level playing field for access to  critical government documents. For those reasons, I urge my colleagues  to support the bill, as amended.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
252,Bill Johnson,0.09144924581050873,R,johnson,johnson," Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for  yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my colleague, Congressman Doug Lamborn.  He is so faithful every year to organize this Special Order series. And  this year, we recognize, as has been mentioned, the 79th anniversary of  National Bible Week.  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to stand with all my Members and friends  today to share our perspectives on why the Bible is so important to us  and to our country. I am often reminded, I think about and reflect  upon, and we quote all the time, the Founders. George Washington, who  was the father of our country, and he famously said, ``Of all the  disposition and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and  morality are indispensable supports.'' They were the foundation of the  very Republic.  And John Adams is our second President. He comes next. He says, ``Our  Constitution is made only for a moral and religious people. It is  wholly inadequate to the government of any other.''  What he meant was that this is essential to who we are as Americans.  Even more fundamental than that, who we are as human beings.  And it was one of my favorite Presidents, Ronald Reagan, who said  that, ``If we ever forget that we are one Nation under God, we will be  a Nation gone under.''  Mr. Speaker, in the very short time I have, I would share one brief  paragraph, a preface to a historic text that I have in my collection.  Some of the guys have this as well. But this is a copy of a New  Testament Bible study that was approved by and published for the public  schools of Dallas, Texas, by its Board of Education in September of  1946.  The preface was written by a gentleman by the name of Henry van Dyke.  And it is a wonderful summary of what the Bible means to us and to the  world. I will read that into the Record.  ``Born in the East and clothed in Oriental form and imagery, the  Bible walks the ways of the world with familiar feet and enters land  after land to find its own everywhere.  ``It has learned to speak in hundreds of languages to the hearts of  men. It comes into the palace to tell the monarch that he is a servant  of the Most High, and into the cottage to assure the peasant that he is  a son of God.  ``Children listen to its stories with wonder and delight, and wise  men ponder them as parables of life. It has a word of peace for the  time of peril, a word of comfort for the time of calamity, a word of  light for the hour of darkness. Its oracles are repeated in the  assembly of the people, and its counsels whispered in the ear of the  lonely.  ``The wicked and the proud tremble at its warnings, but to the  wounded and the penitent, it has a mother's voice. The wilderness and  the solitary place have been made glad by it, and the fire on the  hearth has lit the reading of its well-worn page.  ``It has woven itself into our dearest dreams; so that love,  friendship, sympathy and devotion, memory and hope, put on the  beautiful garments of its treasured speech, breathing of frankincense  and myrrh. No man is poor or desolate who has this treasure for his  own.  ``When the landscape darkens and the trembling pilgrim comes to the  Valley named of the shadow, he is not afraid to enter; he takes the rod  and staff of Scripture in his hand; he says to friend and comrade;  `Goodbye, we shall meet again.' And comforted by that support, he goes  toward the lonely pass as one who walks through darkness and into  light.''  Mr. Speaker, that is a pretty good summary about what the Bible means  to us. I am delighted to honor National Bible Week and to stand with my  friends here.    "
253,Bill Johnson,0.09144924581050873,R,johnson,johnson," Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. Speaker, I think it was Winston  Churchill who said you can always count on Americans to do the right  thing after they have exhausted all other options.  You know, Congress looks that way to me from time to time. This is  not the process or the timeline or the structure I have argued for.  This COVID-19 package doesn't have all the provisions that I have asked  for. It is clearly not a perfect bill.  Yet, it is the targeted and focused relief that our country needs. It  follows the framework that a bipartisan group of eight Senators and  eight House Members, including myself, unveiled a few weeks ago.  We knew then that it was not a perfect bill, but we knew it was the  way forward. I am proud of the role that I have played and that the  Problem Solvers Caucus has played in breaking this gridlock. I am proud  of the role that we have played in making sure that our economy and our  schools can stay open and that our testing and our vaccine deployment  can be ramped up.  Madam Speaker, this has been a messy week, but this is a good day for  America.    "
254,Bill Johnson,0.09144924581050873,R,johnson,johnson," Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I, too, rise today to pay tribute to my good friend and mentor on the  Energy and Commerce Committee, Greg Walden.  I spent 27 years in the United States Air Force. We lived by a code  of conduct every day. We came to work. We embodied those core values of  integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all that we do.  In my experience, it is not often that you find people in private  life or in other sectors of public life who also embody those same core  values, but Chairman Greg Walden does.  Whether he was fighting for healthcare changes for the American  people, to make America more energy independent and secure, whether he  was trying to make sure that Big Tech did not overrun the American  people, [[', Page , H6897, ] you could always count on Greg Walden to be out in front leading, not  following, and, certainly, not leading from behind.  I learned a lot in the 6 years that I served with Greg Walden when  he was on the Energy and Commerce Committee as the chairman, and even  before that as chair of our National Republican Congressional  Committee.  It is with a great deal of sadness that we see him leave because a  lot of core institutional knowledge is going to go out the door. But I  want to say how much I have admired working with Greg Walden.    "
255,Dusty Johnson,0.6715168952941895,R,johnson,johnson," Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to ask the Senate to confirm  Mr. Chad Wolf to be the Under Secretary of the Office of Strategy,  Policy, and Plans at the Department of Homeland Security.  The Under Secretary of the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans  leads an office of over 150 employees with an annual budget of over $37  million to develop and implement DHS policy, long-term goals, and  strategic plans.

I urge my colleagues to support passage of both "", S. 1694, "", the  ``One Small Step Act'' and "", S. 2472, "", ``the Neil A. Armstrong Test  Facility Act.''  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms. Kendra S. Horn) that the House suspend  the rules and pass the bill, "", S. 1694, "", as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to require  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to add  recommendations and inform other relevant agencies of information  relating to the principle of due regard and the limitation of harmful  interference with Apollo landing site artifacts, and for other  purposes.''.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
263,Mike Johnson,0.283258318901062,R,johnson,johnson," Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Mr. Speaker, "", H.R. 8235, ' is a bill that will make a meaningful  difference in the accessibility and transparency of an entire branch of  the Federal Government. It vindicates our critical First Amendment  rights and it will establish a level playing field for access to  critical government documents. For those reasons, I urge my colleagues  to support the bill, as amended.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
264,Mike Johnson,0.283258318901062,R,johnson,johnson," Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for  yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my colleague, Congressman Doug Lamborn.  He is so faithful every year to organize this Special Order series. And  this year, we recognize, as has been mentioned, the 79th anniversary of  National Bible Week.  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to stand with all my Members and friends  today to share our perspectives on why the Bible is so important to us  and to our country. I am often reminded, I think about and reflect  upon, and we quote all the time, the Founders. George Washington, who  was the father of our country, and he famously said, ``Of all the  disposition and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and  morality are indispensable supports.'' They were the foundation of the  very Republic.  And John Adams is our second President. He comes next. He says, ``Our  Constitution is made only for a moral and religious people. It is  wholly inadequate to the government of any other.''  What he meant was that this is essential to who we are as Americans.  Even more fundamental than that, who we are as human beings.  And it was one of my favorite Presidents, Ronald Reagan, who said  that, ``If we ever forget that we are one Nation under God, we will be  a Nation gone under.''  Mr. Speaker, in the very short time I have, I would share one brief  paragraph, a preface to a historic text that I have in my collection.  Some of the guys have this as well. But this is a copy of a New  Testament Bible study that was approved by and published for the public  schools of Dallas, Texas, by its Board of Education in September of  1946.  The preface was written by a gentleman by the name of Henry van Dyke.  And it is a wonderful summary of what the Bible means to us and to the  world. I will read that into the Record.  ``Born in the East and clothed in Oriental form and imagery, the  Bible walks the ways of the world with familiar feet and enters land  after land to find its own everywhere.  ``It has learned to speak in hundreds of languages to the hearts of  men. It comes into the palace to tell the monarch that he is a servant  of the Most High, and into the cottage to assure the peasant that he is  a son of God.  ``Children listen to its stories with wonder and delight, and wise  men ponder them as parables of life. It has a word of peace for the  time of peril, a word of comfort for the time of calamity, a word of  light for the hour of darkness. Its oracles are repeated in the  assembly of the people, and its counsels whispered in the ear of the  lonely.  ``The wicked and the proud tremble at its warnings, but to the  wounded and the penitent, it has a mother's voice. The wilderness and  the solitary place have been made glad by it, and the fire on the  hearth has lit the reading of its well-worn page.  ``It has woven itself into our dearest dreams; so that love,  friendship, sympathy and devotion, memory and hope, put on the  beautiful garments of its treasured speech, breathing of frankincense  and myrrh. No man is poor or desolate who has this treasure for his  own.  ``When the landscape darkens and the trembling pilgrim comes to the  Valley named of the shadow, he is not afraid to enter; he takes the rod  and staff of Scripture in his hand; he says to friend and comrade;  `Goodbye, we shall meet again.' And comforted by that support, he goes  toward the lonely pass as one who walks through darkness and into  light.''  Mr. Speaker, that is a pretty good summary about what the Bible means  to us. I am delighted to honor National Bible Week and to stand with my  friends here.    "
265,Mike Johnson,0.283258318901062,R,johnson,johnson," Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. Speaker, I think it was Winston  Churchill who said you can always count on Americans to do the right  thing after they have exhausted all other options.  You know, Congress looks that way to me from time to time. This is  not the process or the timeline or the structure I have argued for.  This COVID-19 package doesn't have all the provisions that I have asked  for. It is clearly not a perfect bill.  Yet, it is the targeted and focused relief that our country needs. It  follows the framework that a bipartisan group of eight Senators and  eight House Members, including myself, unveiled a few weeks ago.  We knew then that it was not a perfect bill, but we knew it was the  way forward. I am proud of the role that I have played and that the  Problem Solvers Caucus has played in breaking this gridlock. I am proud  of the role that we have played in making sure that our economy and our  schools can stay open and that our testing and our vaccine deployment  can be ramped up.  Madam Speaker, this has been a messy week, but this is a good day for  America.    "
266,Mike Johnson,0.283258318901062,R,johnson,johnson," Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I, too, rise today to pay tribute to my good friend and mentor on the  Energy and Commerce Committee, Greg Walden.  I spent 27 years in the United States Air Force. We lived by a code  of conduct every day. We came to work. We embodied those core values of  integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all that we do.  In my experience, it is not often that you find people in private  life or in other sectors of public life who also embody those same core  values, but Chairman Greg Walden does.  Whether he was fighting for healthcare changes for the American  people, to make America more energy independent and secure, whether he  was trying to make sure that Big Tech did not overrun the American  people, [[', Page , H6897, ] you could always count on Greg Walden to be out in front leading, not  following, and, certainly, not leading from behind.  I learned a lot in the 6 years that I served with Greg Walden when  he was on the Energy and Commerce Committee as the chairman, and even  before that as chair of our National Republican Congressional  Committee.  It is with a great deal of sadness that we see him leave because a  lot of core institutional knowledge is going to go out the door. But I  want to say how much I have admired working with Greg Walden.    "
267,Walter Jones,0.021868299692869186,R,jones,jones," Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I want to first thank Senator Inhofe and  Senator Reed and their staff for their amazing work on this National  Defense Authorization Act. What we are about to accomplish is truly  remarkable, not only for America but for individuals and families.  I am rising today as grateful and as humbled as I could ever imagine  being in this Senate Chamber, but I am also just the opposite--I am  excited like a kid at Christmas waiting to have the final passage of  this because it means so much. We are at the finish line, about to run  through the tape in a race, a marathon that so many folks thought we  could never finish. I am talking about this momentous and historic  National Defense Authorization Act upon which we are about to vote and  pass in just a few moments.  The NDAA includes so many of our collective priorities to bolster the  defense of our Nation, to modernize our military, and to take care of  our servicemembers and their families. But included very deep within  this incredibly thick piece of legislation is a provision that has been  repeatedly introduced over the past 18 years, but it has never gotten  across that finish line. I am speaking about the Military Widow's Tax  Elimination Act.  For the past four decades, the military widow's tax has prevented  surviving military spouses from receiving the full benefits they are  owed by the U.S. Government. Legislation to repeal this unfair law has  been repeatedly introduced in Congress for the last 18 years, but money  and budgets and points of order have always won out over the commitment  we have made to these families. [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7068"">Page S7068</a>, ]  When I introduced it with my friend and colleague Senator Collins  earlier this year, we knew it was going to be an uphill battle. We knew  that the fight had been going on for so long and that we faced a steep  climb, but we took a great deal of strength and motivation from the  impacted widows themselves who have fought and advocated for this bill  for nearly two decades. They have been a regular presence on Capitol  Hill, asking year after year for Members of Congress to lend an ear to  their cause. I was heartbroken when one of them told me they felt like  they were easy to brush off because they were ``just a bunch of little  old ladies.''  I was heartbroken when Cathy Milford said every time she came up here  it was like digging up her husband and burying him all over again.  After 18 years without success, yet all the while being told how  supportive Members of Congress are for their service and sacrifice,  time and time again, you could see how disheartening that might be when  they would go home emptyhanded.  So when I told them this was the year--Senator Collins and I had made  it our mission that this was going to be the year we were finally going  to get this done--there were more than a few of them who were  skeptical, but they were, of course, always optimistic.  We knew we had to fight harder than ever before if we were going to  be successful. We had to make our case that this injustice could no  longer stand. As we did, one by one, Senators and Members of the House  joined this cause with us. By summertime, in this body, we had earned  an unprecedented number of Senators' support for this bill.  Today, as we are about to vote, there are over three-fourths of the  U.S. Senate who have cosponsored this legislation. Think of that. In  such a partisan time as we live in right now, in this moment, three- fourths of the U.S. Senate has voiced their support.  Because of the momentum we built, this is the year, this is the day,  we will finally honor the commitment we made to these families who have  given everything to our country. This is the year, this is the day, we  will let our actions speak louder than words, the year we finally put  our money where our mouth is when it comes to honoring our  servicemembers and their families. This is the year, this is the day,  we finally repeal the widow's tax once and for all.  It is, to be candid, difficult to articulate what it means to me to  be able to help bring this legislation across the finish line for these  surviving spouses.  Their strength, their devotion, and their grit have made this all  possible. Their loved ones gave what Abraham Lincoln called ``the last  full measure of devotion'' to our country, and the continued commitment  to that devotion by their surviving spouses is a daily reminder of why  I am here, why we are all here.  In their own way, these widows have also fought to advance the ideals  and values of the Nation we all love so much. Instead of becoming  bitter or jaded when learning of this injustice, these incredible women  worked to make things right. Year after year, they would gather in  Washington to meet with Members of the House and the Senate to beg  Congress to right this wrong, only to be told that as unfair as this  may be, eliminating the widow's tax would just cost us too much. For 18  years, they were told it could never get done, but they never ever gave  up.  It kind of reminds me of a movie that was one of my favorite movies  years ago called ``Network,'' in which the late actor Peter Finch  starred as a somewhat crazed newscaster who was so fed up with the  state of affairs in this country that he implored all those watching to  go to their windows and throw open the windows and just yell: ``I'm mad  as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore,'' and they did.  That is essentially what these widows did as well. Year after year,  they screamed that they were not going to take it anymore, and they  built momentum that led to this historic vote today.  I am so glad this fight is finally coming to an end. I am going to  miss their regular visits and their friendship. I truly hope they know  how much it has meant to me and my staff as well. My staff has been all  in. Everybody has been so dedicated and so passionate about getting  this across the finish line.  I am deeply grateful to Senators Inhofe and Reed, who have been  critical to this effort to get this done. Without them, it would not  have been possible. For their support, I am truly appreciative.  More important, I am especially grateful to my partner in all of  this, Senator Collins, whose deeply held commitment was vital to our  success.  Today we will celebrate the end to our four-decades-old fight. We  will take stock in this great achievement together, but tomorrow we  must turn our attention to the next big issue because there are so many  others who need our help, our attention, and our courage to do the  right thing.  For now--for now we can celebrate because today those military  spouses who had once proclaimed they were mad as hell and not going to  take it are watching this proceeding with a more joyous feeling. These  widows are watching in the quiet of their homes, perhaps in the  Gallery, many of them grasping a photograph of their loved ones, their  late husbands, but they all have tears in their eyes, saying to each  other and to us in this body: Thank you because now I am happy as hell  that I don't have to take it anymore.  I assure my colleagues that right now their spouses, those who gave  the ultimate sacrifice for this country, are watching from that  heavenly perch above, standing at full attention, and saluting the  Members of this Congress and saying: Thank you. Thank you for  recognizing the ultimate sacrifice I made for this country. Thank you  because you have demonstrated a commitment to me and my service, and  with that final commitment from you, the commitment I made to my loved  ones, the commitment to care for them even after I am gone, has finally  been fulfilled, and I can truly rest in peace.  To my colleagues in the Senate, by your vote today, you are doing so  much more than modernizing our military providing for the Nation's  defense. By your vote today, you are returning their salute--the salute  to those brave servicemembers who gave their all in service to this  country.  Folks, this is a really, really big deal, and I salute all the  Members of this body for their efforts.  I yield the floor.    "
268,Jim Jordan,0.009940136224031448,R,jordan,jordan," Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, House Democrats started the week off with a hearing on  letting criminals out of jail early. They end the week with a bill  legalizing drugs. And they want the American taxpayers to pay for both  programs.  They introduced a bill earlier in the year to give grant dollars to  States to let criminals out of jail early, even violent ones, according  to the letter Mr. Nadler and Chairwoman Bass sent to the Attorney  General. Now, they want to create a trust fund in this bill to give  grants to the marijuana industry and finance the marijuana industry.  Mr. Speaker, these are the actions the Democrats take, the first  actions they take after a national election. Go figure. Maybe that is  why they lost 27 out of 27 toss-up seats around the country. Maybe that  is why our party almost took back the majority.  That is what they choose to focus on at a time when you have Democrat  leaders around the country defunding the police, locking down  businesses, destroying small businesses all over our Nation. This is  what they choose to focus on. This is what they choose to focus on.  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, let me indicate very quickly that every 37 seconds,  between 2001 and 2010, there were 8 million arrests, every 37 seconds,  for marijuana. We spent $3.6 billion on the war on marijuana, and it  has not worked. We do today what saves lives.  We know that States are going to be able to continue to protect their  children, and this does not undermine the ability of Congress to  protect children as well. In every State that has legalized marijuana,  they have developed a comprehensive set of regulations to protect  consumers.  We also recognize that this issue of vaping is not generated by  marijuana use. With a comprehensive structure, we will be able to  protect children and not be selling marijuana to children. Those who  have died in our communities may now live. As well, we will further  understand the importance of a structure that is about restoration of  justice. The imbalance against people of color has been a tragedy.  Mr. Speaker, the MORE Act is crucial to be able to pass, and I ask my  colleagues to do so vigorously as we also fight COVID-19.  Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would like to thank the following  Members and committee and Member staff for their outstanding work on  the MORE Act: Joe Graupensperger, Milagros Cisneros, Christine Leonard,  Barbara Lee, Earl Blumenauer, Nydia Velazquez, and Frank Pallone.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
269,David Joyce,1.352238416671753,R,joyce,joyce," Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, this week, Americans  witnessed a remarkable achievement. Less than a year after the novel  coronavirus reached the shores of America, the first doses of a safe  and effective vaccine were administered to frontline healthcare workers  in Pennsylvania and around the country.  This amazing accomplishment is not only a testament to America's  unparalleled healthcare heroes, researchers and scientists, but it is  also a testament to the promise of American innovation.  In just a matter of months, Operation Warp Speed has harnessed the  full power of the Federal Government, the private sector, and the  scientific community to deliver results for the American people, all in  record time.  I am sincerely grateful to the leaders at the helm of this historic  public/private partnership, including President Donald Trump and  Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, who was born in my  district, in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Truly, all of those who have  served in Operation Warp Speed have done an incredible job.  As our Nation continues to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognize  that a safe and effective vaccine is key to restoring our communities,  rebuilding our economy and, ultimately, saving lives. While the first  COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer already has been granted emergency  authorization from the FDA, we expect more to follow in the coming days  and weeks.  Now, it is imperative for the American people to know the facts about  these vaccines so that they can make informed consent.  Number one: As part of Operation Warp Speed, multiple COVID-19  vaccines are being developed by private companies and simultaneously  produced, accelerating the typical production process so that, as soon  as a safe and effective option is cleared, it is ready to go.  Number two: Each COVID-19 vaccine is undergoing the same rigorous  safety, quality, and efficacy screenings as any other modern vaccine.  Number three: The FDA will only grant emergency use authorization to  a vaccine following the recommendation of an independent advisory  board.  Number four: The American people can be confident in the safety and  the efficacy of a COVID-19 vaccine.  Madam Speaker, like many Americans, I recognize that this vaccine has  lifesaving potential, and I plan to take the vaccine as soon as I am  eligible.  As part of Operation Warp Speed, our Nation is equipped to facilitate  this vaccine distribution more efficiently than any other country in  the world. At the same time, we know that it will take time before  everyone can receive it.  As we wait, this is not the time to grow complacent. COVID-19 cases  are rising in Pennsylvania and around the country, and it is up to all  of us to do our part to protect our family, our friends, and our  neighbors.  This year, I have been amazed by Americans' commitment to one another  and to their communities. Together, we can defeat this virus. As we  wait for the widespread immunization, we must continue to stand strong  against this invisible enemy.  Yes, the coronavirus remains an ever-present threat to America and to  our economy. Yes, we are in a shared fight to save lives and to save  livelihoods. And, yes, there is hope on the horizon. It is arriving in  communities every day in the coolers on UPS and FedEx trucks.  As we near the end of this incredibly challenging year, Americans  have much to be grateful for. Thanks to our scientific community, to  Operation Warp Speed, and especially to our healthcare heroes, there  are brighter days ahead.    "
270,David Joyce,1.352238416671753,R,joyce,joyce," Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Great  Lakes Environmental Sensitivity Index Act of 2020.  I was proud to join Representative Kildee in introducing this bill to  direct the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to update  the environmental sensitivity index maps for the Great Lakes for the  first time in many years.  ESI maps document the potential impacts from coastal resiliency  threats such as oil spills, coastal flooding, and storm damage from  high lake levels, which have recently plagued many communities in my  district.  Having grown up and lived my entire life along the shores of Lake  Erie, I know that the Great Lakes are a national treasure, an economic  powerhouse, and one of the United States' greatest natural resources.  As the largest system of surface fresh water on Earth, the Great  Lakes provide drinking water for an estimated 48 million people,  support more than 1.5 million jobs, and generate $60 billion in wages  annually. That is why it is important that we work together to protect  and preserve the lakes and the communities they sustain. This  legislation will help us do that.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill today.    "

"
274,Marcy Kaptur,0.5755645036697388,D,kaptur,kaptur," Mr. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure today that I rise  in support of strong, bipartisan passage of the Butch Lewis Act.  The Butch Lewis Act will provide the economic security this body  ripped out from under millions of hardworking Americans.  Across our country, 1.3 million workers and retirees face serious and  significant threat of cuts to their hard earned multiemployer pension  plans, through no fault of their own. Several of these plans are large  enough to take down the entire Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation,  threatening the guaranteed security of 10 million Americans.  I have heard the message time and again from retirees in my district  and across this nation: they worked for decades to earn these pensions.  Now they are too old, or their health too unstable, to return to the  workforce. The stress and anxiety are sapping their will. Some have  taken their own lives.  The Butch Lewis Act will provide much needed and long-overdue relief.  The Butch Lewis Act keeps the promises made to retirees. It  guarantees pension benefits they have earned into the future. It does  so by allowing troubled pension plans to borrow the money needed to  remain solvent in 30-year, low interest loans. The plan will repay.  Pensions-have afforded millions of middle-class Americans the  opportunity to enjoy their golden years with economic peace of mind.  Let us restore this peace with swift and just passage of the Butch  Lewis Act.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired.  Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. David P. Roe of Tennessee  Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at  the desk.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:  Amend section 4(b)(2) to read as follows:  (2) Interest rate.--Loans made under subsection (a) shall   have an interest rate of 5 percent for each of the first 5   years and 9 percent thereafter.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to "", House Resolution 509, "", the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. David P. Roe) and a Member opposed each  will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.  Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.  One talking point that I have heard a lot from my friends across the  aisle in support of this bill is that Congress has already bailed out  our Nation's financial institutions so we should bail out the pension  plans.  While I don't agree with that sentiment, if that is the argument,  then we should treat these bailouts the same. Using this logic, my  amendment would set the loan interest rates in the bill at 5 percent  for the first 5 years and 9 percent after that, the same rate given to  banks under the Troubled Asset Relief Program.  While I wasn't in Congress at the time TARP was passed, the situation  we are in today, considering a union pension bailout, is the best  evidence of why we shouldn't have interfered with a bailout of our  private financial institutions. Nevertheless, that decision was made,  and now one bailout is being used to justify another. If we believe  Congress should be in the business of bailing out privately negotiated,  collectively bargained benefit arrangements of private employers, we  should do so using the same terms as TARP.  A key feature of TARP was the Capital Purchase Program, which  provided capital to finance institutions by purchasing senior preferred  shares. My amendment would set the interest rate of loans authorized  under this bill to the same rate that senior preferred stock dividends  paid under TARP's Capital Purchase Program. If these terms were good  enough for the TARP bailout, they should be good enough for the bailout  offered by this bill.  The majority refuses to accept the outrageous risk associated with  making loans in these plans. Instead, this bill offers low-interest  loans to massively underfunded, failing pension plans and allows loan  principal forgiveness if the plans can't be repaid. This is  unbelievable. This proves the majority has no belief that the loans  will ever be repaid and is simply looking to gift hundreds of billions  of dollars of taxpayer funds to these failing pension plans.  What about the retirement plans affected during the same time? What  are we going to bail out next? Are we going to continue having the  Federal Government come along and throw money at badly managed  investments?  If we do make these loans, the government shouldn't just throw the  money at a problem without some guardrails. With TARP, banks were not  given low-interest loans over 30 years and told it really doesn't  matter if they repay them or not, that we will forgive them anyway. In  fact, those loans were repaid, and the government made money doing  that.  Mr. Speaker, having said that, I served as chairman of the Health,  Employment, Labor, and Pension Subcommittee for 6 years. I worked on  the bill with Chairman Kline and Ranking Member Miller to help solve  this problem. It is a huge problem.  My father was a union member who lost his job 30 years after World  War II, so I have been down that road with my own family.  I am willing to work across the aisle. As Mr. Neal stated, I was on  that committee that didn't do anything. I am willing now to work on  this.  This bill, I disagree with him, is not going anywhere. The PBGC  chairman today said that we should work in a bipartisan way, and I am  sitting here today telling the gentleman that I am willing to do that.  I have been willing to for the past 6 years. We did pass that bill back  about 4 years ago, which will help with the plans, so I am willing to  do that. This plan is not it.  I urge support of my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    "

In closing, Senator Hatch was one of the longest-serving members of  the U.S. Senate, often working on a bipartisan basis to get the work of  the American people done.  This bill will honor and recognize his dedication and decades of  service to this great Nation.  Madam Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    "
276,William Keating,0.9813510775566101,D,keating,keating," Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, for several years, I was a letter  carrier, working my way through college and grad school, working  overtime as mail volume necessitated--and, yes, necessitated. It was  understood then that it was a necessity.  I worked with dedicated postal workers, many of whom were veterans  who persevered through emergencies--hurricane, blizzards, floods. As  the motto says, ``gloom of night.''  Now, our country faces new emergencies, a pandemic that threatens  lives and encumbers our basic rights, like the right to vote safely and  in an economic crisis, where 600,000 Postal Service workers battle  back, providing economic stimulus and $1.6 trillion in sales revenues.  The Postal Service is an economic and healthcare lifeline, a lifeline  that Donald Trump is trying to sever, all to sabotage mail-in voting he  thinks will dampen his chances to cling to power.  He is the gloom of night, and it is our job, our duty, to throw some  sunlight his way and to stop him.    "
277,Fred Keller,0.23355764150619507,R,keller,keller," Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of "", S. 3989, "", the United States  Semiquincentennial Commission Amendments Act.  Our country's Declaration of Independence was courageously signed in  1776. This makes 2026 the 250th anniversary our great Republic and its  founding.  An exposition marking the 150th anniversary was in Philadelphia in  1926, and bicentennial celebrations were held throughout the country in  1976. It is only fitting that we also celebrate the 250th anniversary,  another milestone anniversary.  To do this, Congress passed and the President signed the United  States Semiquincentennial Commission Act of 2016 in the 114th Congress.  The bill before us today would amend the law authorizing the  Commission, with necessary changes, to allow the planning work to  continue. "", S. 3989, "" grants the Commission certain flexibilities, such as  no longer requiring every meeting convene at Independence Hall in  Philadelphia. The law would still recognize Philadelphia's importance  and requires at least one meeting per year to be held in the City of  Brotherly Love.  This bill, "", S. 3989, ', would add the directors of several Federal  agencies focused [[', Page , H7245, ] on the arts to assist with the planning. The bill would also grant the  Commission exclusive rights over their official logo for commercial  licensing purposes, which would help provide additional funding  resources for the Commission's work. These changes will allow the  Commission and the rest of the United States to better celebrate our  country's 250th anniversary.  Madam Speaker, as the Commission noted in their 2020 report to the  President, ``America 250,'' the central theme of the celebrations, will  be ``educate, engage, and unite.'' Specifically, the Commission's  primary goal with these celebrations is to inspire the American spirit;  to deepen the understanding of our history and the democratic process  through education; increase engagement in our communities and governing  affairs; and foster unity, that includes the many Americans in our  ``one Nation.''  Madam Speaker, I think my colleagues would agree that more than ever,  Americans stand to benefit from a national celebration reflecting on  our shared values which unite us as a country, a country uniquely  founded on a set of ideals.  Every one of us owes a debt of gratitude to the framework of  freedoms, rights, and government institutions our Founding Fathers  established with such a discerning forethought. We look forward to the  Commission's plans being finalized next year and for the forthcoming  celebrations of America's founding, a country we all love so well.  Madam Speaker, we look forward to celebrating the 250th anniversary  of America's founding. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    "

As ranking member of the Military Personnel Subcommittee, I stand  before you today in proud support of the National Defense Authorization  Act for fiscal year 2021. The conference report reflects bipartisan  compromise that has been a hallmark of this committee for 59  consecutive years.  The National Defense Authorization Act has always been about ensuring  the national defense of the United States, which would be impossible  without appropriate focus on the men and women who tirelessly serve  this country; and appropriate focus on their families who serve this  great Nation by supporting their loved ones time and again; through the  deployments, the training periods and all the challenges of day-to-day  living. We owe them a great debt of gratitude. The NDAA also preserves  a number of robust TRICARE and retirement benefits for our retirees.  To this end, we addressed a number of significant and overdue policy  issues that would directly improve the quality of life of our  servicemembers and their families.  The NDAA authorizes a 3 percent increase in basic pay for  servicemembers. It also standardizes the payment of hazardous duty  incentive pay and increases hazardous duty pay from $250 to $275 a  month for members of the uniformed services.  The NDAA reinforces the committee's longstanding commitment to the  military family by requiring the Department of Defense to redefine  military family readiness and military personnel resiliency, and it  provides for significant reforms in the Exceptional Family Member  Program.  Of course, the NDAA also addresses COVID-19.  This is an outstanding bipartisan NDAA dedicated to our  servicemembers, military families, and retirees, and gives them the  care and support they need, deserve, and have earned.  I thank my staff, Sergeant Major Jeremy Barton, my Army Fellow;  Rodney Hall, my MLA; and our MILPER staff, Glen Diehl and Paul Golden.  I thank Chairwoman Speier for working together with me to do a great  Military Personnel mark. Finally, I thank Mac Thornberry, a mentor,  leader, and friend.    "

287,Joseph Kennedy,1.3000255823135376,D,kennedy,kennedy," Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say good-bye to this body  as my time serving the Fourth Congressional District of Massachusetts  comes to a close.  This job has been an honor. We have come quite a long way since my  first days in the Capitol when I had an AP reporter following me around  for the day, and I got so lost trying to find the House floor that I  ended up in the Longworth parking garage.  Luckily, things have mostly improved from there:  Seeing my name on that office door for the first time;  Keeping company with giants that I grew up idolizing, like John  Lewis, Eliseo Medina, and Dolores Huerta;  Having the honor of responding to Donald Trump's first State of the  Union from Diman Regional Voc-Tech in mighty Fall River, Massachusetts.  There are a few people who I would not be here without.  To my wife, Lauren: Thank you for serving alongside me, for the  sacrifices that you made and the heart that you gave to this job, too.  Tell Ellie and James that dad has breakfast, bath, and school drop-off  duty for the next 15 years or so.  To the Massachusetts delegation: I loved serving with you. I loved  learning from you. There is no team I would rather have been in the  trenches with every day.  To my constituents back home: I am so grateful for the trust that you  put in me. My proudest moments were when you allowed me to bring your  voice to this Chamber, when I could carry what you felt in Taunton or  Attleboro or Fall River or Milford to this floor. Thank you for the  privilege that you afforded me. I will see you back home soon.  Finally, to the staff members who worked and thought and fought and  talked and wrote and served alongside me over the course of the last 8  years; you all are the heroes behind my story. There will never be  words for my gratitude for everything that you took on every single  day--and so many nights--to ensure that we did this job right. I will  miss not seeing all of your faces quite so often.  Mr. Speaker, I leave this body proud and hopeful because here is what  I know: that we are a complicated and messy country, that we violated  our founding promises before the ink was dry. We boldly declared, ``We  the people,'' and promptly defined ``we'' as rich, White, Protestant  men. We staked out moral high ground of life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness, and paid for it with human bondage, abuse, and suffering  that we carry to this day.  But embedded in that history is a slow and stubborn story that every  generation shares, a journey to heal those wounds, an understanding  fought and bled for over time that we are in this mess together whether  we like it or not.  Our arc isn't clean, but it is clear that each generation expands  that definition of ``we.'' We suffer setbacks. We get pushed off track  and sometimes can't feel that progress. We fight amongst ourselves. But  still, generation after generation, we expand.  And that is the counterweight to the great lie of these times, that  the American pie is finite; that for my family to survive, yours must  suffer; that the richest Nation on Earth is somehow plagued by scarcity  rather than greed.  Loosening that lie's grip on our country is the work of our  generation--for people who feel unseen, unheard, and unrepresented; for  the most in need of assistance and protection, justice and opportunity,  who have been told by their government that there is no room or money  or time or will.  And that injustice is a reality etched in stone rather than a  deliberate choice by those in power about who is worthy and who is not.  I hope that in the months and years ahead, this body can help change  that, that we will err on the side of expansion, of inclusion,  acceptance, equity, and grace, because history makes clear that the  only true error is when we do the absolute opposite.  Our future is big and bright, but it will take everything and  everyone to reach it. I hope that a new generation of Americans will  rise knowing that the people's House stands tall for them.  Mr. Speaker, it has been an honor. God bless and Godspeed.    "

Madam Speaker, I commend the chairman for his work in moving quickly  and putting this legislation together. I commend those on the other  side who will stand with us today and support this.  It is my hope that this legislation will quickly go over to the  Senate. They will get the message and send this legislation on to the  President, wherever he may be.

Growing the number of computer science programs for students in high  school and beyond will provide more 21st century job opportunities for  our kids, more high-skilled and qualified employees for our employers,  and more economic resiliency for our communities.  I thank the chairman for his support of this simple, yet important,  amendment. I thank Representative Susan Davis from California for her  leadership on this issue, and I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes''  on this package and ``yes'' on this bill.    "
291,Andrew Kim,1.8459186553955078,D,kim,kim," Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  resolution and in strong opposition to the rise of hate crimes and acts  of racism toward Americans of Asian descent.  We all know that these are divisive times. They are tough times.  Hateful language, petty name-calling, and acts of violence are not the  way for us to get through these tough times. This resolution allows  Congress to come together to speak with one voice, that hate targeted  at the Asian-American community has no place in this country and must  be condemned.  I am especially proud to speak here today with so many of my AAPI  colleagues. Many of us have been the victims of these hateful and  harmful actions. We have seen firsthand the vitriol of racism. We have  felt the sting of the distrustful look or a harsh word.  I hope you will join me today in acknowledging the impact of racism  and forcefully renouncing it. I hope you will join me here today in  calling on unity and calling out division. And I hope you will join me  here today in passing a resolution that can remind us that even in the  darkest times we are strongest when we reject hate and embrace  America's diversity.    "
292,Ron Kind,1.8920905590057373,D,kind,kind," Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I rise in proud support of this trade  agreement. It is important that we have a strong trading relationship  with our two border neighbors, Mexico and Canada, our two biggest  export markets.  I just caution my colleagues who choose to vote ``no'' on this that a  ``no'' vote is a return to the failed policy of the old NAFTA, the  status quo, rather than this more modernized version.  I am happy that dairy farmers in America are going to have greater  access to the Canadian market.  We made progress on poultry and eggs.  We also tightened up the sanitary and phytosanitary standards so that  those decisions have to be made on sound science rather than arbitrary  decisions to block our agricultural exports.  We have, perhaps, the strongest worker protection chapter ever in the  trade agreement, enhanced environmental standards, all to level the  playing field for our workers, our farmers, our businesses so they can  fairly compete rather than trying to compete in a race to the bottom.  Perhaps most importantly, we have the strongest enforcement chapter  ever, and we look forward to working with Mexico and Canada to  implement it the right way to make sure we are all playing by the same  rules.  So this is solid, and I want to commend the chair, the ranking  member, the working group, but also the staff for the countless hours  that they put in to get us to this place, but especially Ambassador Bob  Lighthizer for his perseverance and patience throughout these months.  These were difficult negotiations. This is what bipartisanship looks  like on the House floor, where we are able to get this across the  floor.  I encourage my colleagues to support this agreement, support the  Northern Hemisphere economy. Show the rest of the world that we are  back in business.    "

I have  known, unfortunately, too many people who suffer from ALS.  It is 100 percent fatal. That is the reality of it.  All of us who meet advocates every year coming in to lobby us, or to  urge us to support more research funding for ALS, we realize very  quickly they may be there 1 year and 2 years, and then we never see  them again because they have died. It is a brutal neurodegenerative  neuromuscular disease, and this 5-month limit that was put on them  before they can obtain disability benefits was so unfair.  During that 5 months, the disease can progress so rapidly. The  medical costs go up. The psychological costs are there. By passing this  legislation today, we are going to provide not just financial relief  but also psychological and emotional care and relief for their families  and friends.  In New York, we always refer to this as Lou Gehrig's disease after  the famed Yankee slugger, and I am saying that as a Mets fan. Lou  Gehrig is a hero in New York. Unfortunately, as great as his baseball  record is, he is known most for the disease that ended both his career  and his life.  Let me just say also, this will be my final appearance on the House  floor speaking, the last time I speak on the House floor. I want to say  what a great honor it has been to serve for these past 28 years with  all of the Members. It has been a great privilege for me. One of the  real privileges is being able to support legislation such as this,  which is so needed and so necessary.    "

299,Adam Kinzinger,0.8415959477424622,R,kinzinger,kinzinger," Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this to the  floor.  When we think about Russian prisons, we don't often think about  justice because, frankly, justice is at the whim of Vladimir Putin, the  man who poisons citizens on NATO territory and uses the bludgeon of a  hammer to actually get his will and power.  So sometimes I think when we as Americans look at our political  debates, we look at it as a form of dysfunction when, in reality, while  the debate can be dysfunctional, it is very functional that we are  having them.  But in this case, I think it needs to be clear that we stand up for  American citizens no matter what, and we don't care what their  political stripes are when they are detained by somebody like Vladimir  Putin.  This resolution calls for the immediate release of Trevor Reed. He is  a U.S. citizen, he is a Marine Corps veteran, and he was unjustly  sentenced to 9 years in a Russian prison.  He has been detained for over a year now on baseless charges filed  through an overtly corrupt trial.  His lawyers have been denied access to the so-called evidence that  the Russian authorities used to detain Trevor.  After speaking with his mother, I have learned that his family has  had a difficult time talking to him on the phone, limited interaction,  because the authorities will not let Trevor communicate in English and  they give him only a few calls home.  It is an abuse of power and it is a clear attempt by the Russians to  make an example of Trevor, an American, and this must be rectified  immediately.  Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleagues for bringing up this important  measure to the floor today.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Conaway and I thank the chair and ranking  member. I thank Chairman Engel for his many, many years of service as  well on the committee and in this House.    "

301,Raja Krishnamoorthi,0.6397902965545654,D,krishnamoorthi,krishnamoorthi," Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, today, on the 102nd anniversary of  his birth, I rise to honor Dr. Govindappa Venkataswamy, an Indian  ophthalmologist who devoted his life to preventing blindness in India  and across the world.  Dr. Venkataswamy's work preserved the vision of millions of men,  women, and children, allowing them the blessing of sight and the  opportunity to enjoy independent, productive lives.  Though Dr. V suffered from a severe form of rheumatoid arthritis that  left his hands permanently disfigured, he defied all odds to become an  expert ophthalmologist and mastered the art of cataract surgery.  Having witnessed the terrible impact of blindness on those without  the means to pay for their own care, Dr. V pursued an extraordinarily  ambitious program to end preventable blindness in India.  In 1976, Dr. V and members of his family founded the first of what  would later become a network of Aravind Eye Hospitals in Madurai,  India.  The Aravind Eye Care System has been acclaimed by Harvard Business  School and is the focus of an HBS case study. It has also been  recognized for excellence in publications, including Fast Company,  Forbes, and The Wall Street Journal, and it has inspired healthcare  organizations throughout the developing world.  From its humble beginning in Madurai, the Aravind Eye Care System now  provides care to over 4 million patients and performs over 500,000  surgeries each year in hospitals and clinics throughout south India. [["", Page , H5113, ]  Dr. V passed away in 2006, but his legacy continues to give eyesight  to those who otherwise would be blind, and his story continues to  inspire millions.  His life is best celebrated by his own words:  When we identify ourselves with all that is in the world,   there is no exploitation. It is ourselves we are helping. It   is ourselves we are healing.    "
302,Ann Kuster,0.987284779548645,D,kuster,kuster," Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak of the  urgent need to pass bipartisan COVID-19 relief legislation as Congress  works to conclude our work this year.  Families, businesses, and workers in New Hampshire are feeling the  continued pain and impact of this pandemic as cases reach record highs  in my State and hospitals and frontline health workers brace for the  expected surge.  This week, I was pleased to see Democrats and Republicans in the  House and the Senate come together to find common ground and release a  promising framework that we should consider immediately. This  legislation would bolster our public health and economic response to  COVID-19 to help us get through the long, cold, dark winter ahead.  Democrats and Republicans won't get everything they want, but we need  to come together and put politics aside.  This legislation includes new funding for the Paycheck Protection  Program for small businesses, State and local funding for our first  responders, extended unemployment, and critical funding to help with  the distribution of the promising COVID-19 vaccine, as well as $5  billion in funding to combat the opioid epidemic, which, tragically,  continues to rage.  It is time to come together and get the job done.    "
303,David Kustoff,0.29319846630096436,R,kustoff,kustoff," Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Suzette Mink, from Millington, Tennessee, for her strong service to  Shelby County government as she is set to retire in a few weeks.  Suzette's service to Memphis and Shelby County started in 1985 when  she began working for the Shelby County Trustee's Office. From there,  she [["", Page , H4434, ] worked for the Shelby County general sessions court clerk, the general  sessions criminal court judges' office, and then the general sessions  civil court judges' office, where she will retire after 17 years of  faithful service to these judges.  In 2019, Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris awarded Suzette with the  Shelby County Shining Star Award. This award is given to someone who  has shown exemplary dedication to their job within Shelby County  government, and this award was much deserved.  I know I speak on behalf of all of Memphis and Shelby County, and the  judges, when I thank Suzette for her service to our community. When I  think of true public servants, we talk about people like Suzette.  I wish her and her husband, Derrick, the best in their retirement.    "
304,Doug LaMalfa,0.4200669825077057,R,lamalfa,lamalfa," Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 235.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    "
305,Conor Lamb,2.749350070953369,D,lamb,lamb," Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, for the last 2\\1/2\\ years, I have been a  member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs; and during that  time, one of the things I have seen is the way that our veterans  service organizations, particularly the American Legion, the VFW, the  Vietnam Veterans of America, but several others, too, play an essential  role in connecting all of the good things that we are trying to do with  government programs with the people who actually need to benefit from  them and take advantage of them.  So often in government, we have a hard time getting our ideas and our  solutions beyond the walls of the Federal office building and into the  communities and streets and homes where we want them to be, and these  organizations are very, very good at doing that.  So I want to thank my colleague, Republican Representative Van Taylor  from Texas, for partnering with me on these amendments to bring in  these veterans service organizations as part of signing people up and  enrolling them in apprenticeship programs so that the veterans who are  out there who are most in need of up-skilling or creating a new career  path can actually find out about these opportunities and take advantage  of them.  There is probably no one in America more qualified and a better bet  for this investment than a veteran. On-the-job training is what we do.  These people have the patience and discipline to complete these  programs and make our entire workforce stronger and better off, and I  know that the veterans service organizations will help us get there.    "
306,Doug Lamborn,0.385675311088562,R,lamborn,lamborn," Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, "", H.R. 7489, ', as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
307,James Langevin,2.4950084686279297,D,langevin,langevin," Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut  (Mr. Larson) for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of "", S. 578, "", the ALS  Disability Insurance Access Act, which ensures that individuals who are  diagnosed with ALS are not forced to wait to receive the Social  Security Disability benefits that they have earned and they so  desperately need.  The onset of a disability can be a difficult, challenging, and often  disorienting time. However, by eliminating the 5-month waiting period  for ALS patients to receive disability benefits, we can help families  facing this difficult diagnosis focus on their health and well-being  instead of worrying about how to keep a roof over their head or put  food on the table.  Madam Speaker, I applaud my good friend and colleague, Senator  Sheldon Whitehouse, for championing this bipartisan effort in the  Senate. He has been a strong voice for the ALS community as co-chair of  the Senate ALS Caucus, and I have been proud to work with him on this  legislation.  Madam Speaker, I also recognize our colleague here, Representative  Seth Moulton, for his leadership as well.  Madam Speaker, I also want to recognize one of my constituents,  Christa Thompson, who has been a dedicated crusader for the ALS  community. Christa knows the struggle all too well, as she has watched  her husband, Olin, battle this devastating disease.  Christa, a proud mother of three boys, made it her mission to engage  with me and my delegation colleagues early on, and it is in large part  due to her efforts and the efforts of ALS advocates everywhere,  including my good friend, J.R. Pagliarini, who has been such a champion  of ALS back in Rhode Island, that we will be able to provide some  important relief to families.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  measure.  Let's make a difference for these families and those diagnosed with  ALS.    "
308,Rick Larsen,0.24046944081783295,D,larsen,larsen," Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  ', H.R. 8408, ', the Aircraft Certification Reform and Accountability Act. [[', Page , H5846, ]  This comprehensive, bipartisan legislation will help improve the U.S.  aircraft certification process, strengthen Federal Aviation  Administration oversight, and ensure the safety of air travel.  As chair of the Aviation Subcommittee, I am very pleased that this  critical legislation is now before this Chamber for a vote.  After two tragic Boeing 737 MAX crashes, the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee launched a thorough investigation into the  design, development, and certification of the 737 MAX.  Since March 2019, the committee has received more than 500,000 pages  of documents, held five oversight hearings, interviewed key employees  at Boeing and the FAA, and listened to testimony from victims' families  and from several whistleblowers.  The resulting Aircraft Certification Reform and Accountability Act  improves aviation safety culture, enhances transparency and  accountability, addresses undue pressure on employees acting on behalf  of the FAA within an aviation manufacturer, and reinforces the  importance of human factors in aircraft design and certification.  The 346 victims of the two tragic crashes and their families have  always remained at the forefront of this committee's work.  A vital part of the committee's process was the advocacy of the  victims' families. For nearly 2 years, the families have championed  necessary reforms to the FAA certification process to ensure that no  other families experience such unthinkable loss.  This bill reinforces the integrity of the FAA and U.S. aviation  manufacturing.  I thank Chairman DeFazio for his leadership. I thank Ranking Member  Graves of Missouri of the full committee for his leadership. And I  thank the ranking member of the Aviation Subcommittee, Mr. Graves of  Louisiana, for his leadership on coming together in a bipartisan way to  make this bill a reality.  Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill.    "
309,John Larson,0.38074079155921936,D,larson,larson," Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, the American people are  incredibly frustrated, and rightly so. This relief package, while a  step forward, should have been passed months ago. House Democrats first  passed the Heroes Act in May; at the same time, Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell called for a `pause' and Senate Republicans refused to act  until now.  More than 315,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. Experts have  said if we had made a larger investment in testing and tracing, many of  these deaths could have been prevented. Millions of Americans are  unemployed and many are facing food insecurity. Our state and local  governments, including first responders, have been on the frontlines of  this pandemic but are being left out of this relief package. We can and  we must do more.  As I have said before, we cannot get the economy up and running until  we conquer the virus.  Today's relief package makes significant investments in testing and  tracing efforts, vaccines, therapeutics, and medical supplies and  funding for underserved communities, all of which are critical to  crushing this pandemic.  This package provides help for the millions of Americans who are  struggling right now. It strengthens critical programs for those who  are unemployed by extending and enhancing unemployment insurance and  rental assistance. It also offers $600 in direct payments to low- and  moderate-income Americans and includes a $13 billion increase in food  assistance programs to help the millions of families facing food  insecurity.  This bill also includes vital funding for small businesses, including  specific funding for arts and cultural programs and smaller businesses  who weren't able to access the initial relief funding.  These are welcome steps forward, but they are just a down payment on  what needs to be done.    "
310,Robert Latta,0.959251880645752,R,latta,latta," Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, again, it has been a tremendous run with all  the work that you have done. You have been a gentleman and a good  friend.  Something I learned from my dad from his 36 years in public service,  and I will say it again on this floor. He said there is a difference  between people who are politicians and public servants. He said a  politician is a person who sees how much they can take from the people  they represent for their own benefit, while a public servant sees how  much they can give of themselves back to the people they represent.  For what you have done for not only your constituents of your great  State but also here in this body, we are going to miss you.  So, Greg, and that is the first time I have ever used a first name on  this floor, we are going to miss you. I am going to miss you, but we  wish you all the best in the years to come.    "
311,Brenda Lawrence,0.2454857975244522,D,lawrence,lawrence," Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, obviously, my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle are not aware that fraud is a Federal--voter fraud is  a crime. We have already established and funded the United States  Postal Inspection Service.  Little do they know, whenever an employee is in a postal facility,  there are internal galleys in every facility where you are observed for  24 hours a day by postal inspectors. Mr. Speaker, I am very comfortable  that we will adhere to those laws. We have clerks who have sworn duties  to protect elections.  But let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, 3 months ago this House passed the  HEROES Act, and I ask my colleagues to [[', Page , H4297, ] open their mail because we sent them a letter that will protect the  Postal Service. We sent them a letter saying that we need to send  funding to the States and local governments so they will not defund the  police departments.  If you want to know who is defunding the police department, the lack  of a movement in the Senate to send that necessary money to cities who  must balance their budget. And the only way they can balance their  budget is to cut because they don't have the funding that has been  taken away from them because of COVID.  So you have the responsibility, Mr. Speaker, the Republicans have on  their hands the defunding of our police department. I wanted, too, to  be very clear that we have heard repeatedly that the Democrats had  manufactured a crisis at the expense of this President, and that the  emergency funding is ``an unnecessary bailout plan.''  We do not need to help the current President to create a crisis. We  have seen every single day statements from the White House about what  we are doing and what we should not do with the Postal Service. I want  everyone here to know that every postal employee takes an oath that  they will adhere to the Constitution, that they will serve and protect.  The majority of the postal workers are veterans who have served in  the military, who continue their service in the Postal Service. I want  it to be very clear that this election that is being held hostage right  now by the Postal Service's internal decisions to tear it apart, where  you have over 600,000 employees reporting to work who want to uphold  their oath of office.  I want to say today, Mr. Speaker, that the Postal Service motto is  neither rain, snow, heat or gloom of night you will not deter these  carriers from their mission. And we are standing here today saying, no.  Return to sender this unnecessary MTR. That we, as Democrats, we are  putting forth this bill to ensure that we are not in that place where  we are going to try to deter the Postal Service from doing their job.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to wake up, to understand that this  is not a Democrat or Republican issue, because the ballots that are  going to be moving through the Postal Service, some of them may even go  to them, they better protect the Postal Service.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.  There was no objection.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.    "
312,Al Lawson,0.645215630531311,D,lawson,lawson," Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, today I rise to commemorate the  120th anniversary of ``Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing.''  This hymn was first performed this week 120 years ago by 500 school  children at the segregated Stanton School in Jacksonville, Florida.  Today this song is widely known as the Black national anthem and is  performed at churches, schools, sporting events, and meetings around  the Nation.  Brothers James Weldon Johnson and John Rosamond Johnson wrote this  song at their home in the LaVilla community of Jacksonville in the  Fifth Congressional District, the district I represent.  It was there that James Weldon penned the words that inspired hope,  strength, and faith. It also reminded us to never forget the obstacles  of the past.  I am honored to represent the birthplace of this great song that will  live on for generations to come.    "
313,Al Lawson,0.645215630531311,D,lawson,lawson," Mr. LAWSON. Madam Speaker, I rise to speak for HBCUs. I would like to  thank my colleague, Ms. Adams, for all her input and how she has worked  extremely hard to put HBCUs at the forefront. [["", Page , H9216, ]  I grew up in a rural area in the country where we were let out of  high school early so that we could work in the tobacco fields in  Gadsden County. I had no idea what college was really like until  Florida A&M gave me the opportunity to attend college there.  For 132 years Florida A&M has been educating a large number of  baccalaureate degree-holders in this country, as well as engineers,  pharmacists, and you just name it, especially in the school of business  where we had one of the greatest leaders in this country of all time to  head up that school that really contributed to corporate America.  Without HBCUs, I know that I wouldn't be here. A boy walking bare- footed in the countryside had the opportunity to represent HBCUs, not  only in the State legislature but now in Congress. They have made a  major impact on this country and on economics that many of my  colleagues have talked about today.  When you think about it, where would this country be without that  impact?  On September 30 of this year, the funding was not authorized. But  that $255 million that the House unanimously passed is now sitting in  the Senate. It is imperative that we encourage our Senators to approve  this because many of these schools would not be able to function  without that funding. I happen to represent not only Florida A&M  University but Edward Waters College where it is critically needed for  these schools to survive.  Over the past 30 or 40 years, the issue also comes up, Madam Speaker,  about where HBCUs are going. Many of today's HBCUs have taken  minorities and international students from all over the country, more  so than some of the majority institutions, and they have done well. In  the area of STEM and technology, in science, we need more and more  people in STEM around the country.  Where can they come from?  They come from HBCUs.  When you look at the number of Ph.D. candidates and the number one to  get Ph.D.s in this country, where do they come from?  They come from HBCUs.  I am really proud of the fact that HBCUs, especially Florida A&M  University, molded me into the leader that I am today. It made me  appreciate hard work. I had the opportunity to have professors that  really cared about me and a goal. So for some 30-some years I have been  a part of this leadership.  I applaud Congresswoman Adams for all of her hard work and for  bringing it to the forefront. We stand here tonight to send a message  out there that we are a part of America. We are part of the American  Dream, and we urge our colleagues to support it.    "
314,Barbara Lee,1.0366603136062622,D,lee,lee," Mr. LEE. Madam President, where I come from in Utah, $700 million is  a lot of money. Seven hundred million dollars is something we ought to  worry about where we are going to get it.  It is not unreasonable for us to request that the House of  Representatives agree to the language we unanimously, on a bipartisan  basis, passed out of the Senate Commerce Committee.  In my mind, it is unfortunate that we are allowing the House of  Representatives' unreasonable, unwarranted demand--a demand the  chairman of the Commerce Committee himself acknowledges is one they  shouldn't object to--to rule the day and prevent this legislation from  becoming law.    "

316,Barbara Lee,1.0366603136062622,D,lee,lee," Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the people  of Nevada's Third Congressional District with a plea to all of my  colleagues:  We are now entering the darkest period of this pandemic. Americans  are scared, and I don't blame them. Americans are also angry, and they  should be. They are angry at Congress and this administration for  failing to pass more relief for struggling families, frontline workers,  and small businesses.  Thousands more Nevadans filed for unemployment during the last few  weeks. Over 400,000 Nevadans remain at risk of eviction as housing  assistance expires.  As this virus uncontrollably spreads in every corner of this country,  our frontline workers and hospitals are overwhelmed with a tidal wave  of new COVID-positive patients.  There is no more time for political games that have consumed Congress  for months. There never was. I am pleading to my Republican and  Democratic colleagues, to our leadership, and to this administration:  It is time to do our jobs and pass more COVID-19 relief now.    "
317,Barbara Lee,1.0366603136062622,D,lee,lee," Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, it was very close, very close. It is very  difficult coming toward this Mother's Day, but we have to thank them  and honor them for giving us life.    "
318,Barbara Lee,1.0366603136062622,D,lee,lee," Mr. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, let me also say how important it  is that we really understand and recognize that this is a global  pandemic and it knows no borders.  This bill will also ramp up testing, contact tracing, and outreach to  ensure that those communities most impacted are supported. It  strengthens outreach to medically underserved communities. Again, Black  and Brown and indigenous people have suffered the most from COVID.  This bill will ensure that the testing and tracing efforts treat  people of color as partners in engaging their communities.  This is a health and economic pandemic of enormous proportions that  we have never experienced in our lifetime. We must make sure that  people have safe places to work and attend school. Their health and  economic needs are addressed in this bill. We cannot have one without  the other.  So let's pass this comprehensive relief. Let's begin to try to heal  our country. Please support this bill, and I ask for an ``aye'' vote.    "
319,Susie Lee,0.9157986640930176,D,lee,lee," Mr. LEE. Madam President, where I come from in Utah, $700 million is  a lot of money. Seven hundred million dollars is something we ought to  worry about where we are going to get it.  It is not unreasonable for us to request that the House of  Representatives agree to the language we unanimously, on a bipartisan  basis, passed out of the Senate Commerce Committee.  In my mind, it is unfortunate that we are allowing the House of  Representatives' unreasonable, unwarranted demand--a demand the  chairman of the Commerce Committee himself acknowledges is one they  shouldn't object to--to rule the day and prevent this legislation from  becoming law.

324,Debbie Lesko,1.1124917268753052,R,lesko,lesko," Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I am glad that we finally have a  bipartisan deal for COVID relief, but the process has been absolutely  terrible.  I have to tell you that we have, what, 6,000 pages? And what did we  get?  We got it, like, maybe 2 hours ago, the text of it. We were waiting  all night.  In fact, Speaker Pelosi had called Members back last week. We thought  we were going to be doing this last Wednesday. Instead, we were doing  all these suspension bills. People had to fly from all over the  country--all the Congress Members--in crowded airports, crowded planes;  not really good for mitigating COVID, if you ask me.  Madam Speaker, I will say, though, that I am glad that, finally,  after months and months of Republicans asking for a bipartisan COVID  relief bill that could actually get signed into law, we are actually  here today, even if it is a couple days before Christmas. And it is a  bill that will help small businesses and their workers, will help the  airline industry, will be a solution to Americans who are struggling  with surprise medical bills.  {time} 1630  For those who are unemployed because of the coronavirus, because the  governments have shut down the businesses, it will give unemployment  insurance relief. But there will be protections in there to make sure  that the people are really unemployed and that they will accept a  reasonable offer for a job.  Also good in the bill is that there is not only money for vaccine  procurement but for distribution of the vaccines.  On that note, I want to applaud President Trump for his action in  Operation Warp Speed and for working with the private sector to get  vaccines done and out the door in record time. This has never been done  before in history. Normally, it takes years and years for vaccines to  be done.  Thank you, President Trump, for your hard work for the American  people.    "

Taylor made her mark as a student activist at Royal Oak High School.  She was beginning her college career at Grand Valley State University  when her life was taken so tragically several days ago.  I met Taylor when I was running for Congress in 2018 and she was  launching a Students Demand Action chapter. Taylor immediately struck  me as a huge flash of sunshine in an unjust world. Her commitment to  justice was frank and undeniable. You knew the world would change at  least a little because Taylor was present, fighting for sensible gun  reform, fighting for everyone to see and cherish Black lives, and  fighting to empower women and girls.  Taylor made me feel that every minute we invest in our young people  is time well-spent. I feel that now, even as we struggle to cope with  her loss, because she inspired me and so many folks young and old all  around her.  My heart goes out to Taylor's devoted mother, Cara, and all who knew  and loved her in this time of heartbreak and mourning.    "

Mr. Speaker, we simply cannot allow our  veterans to fall into homelessness, end up jobless, or go without the  basic services that they deserve. These challenges have only been  exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.  I am proud to lead the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans  Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act so that we can do right by our  veterans during this pandemic and beyond.  This legislation includes several of my bipartisan bills. It includes  the Reducing Veteran Homelessness Act and the Homeless Veteran  Coronavirus Response Act to lift veterans out of homelessness.  It includes the Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William ``Bill'' Mulder  Transition Improvement Act to ease the transition to civilian life and  help veterans build meaningful careers.  It includes the Protect the GI Bill Act and the Pandemic Assistance  for Student Veterans Act to help veterans make the most of their GI  Bill benefits.  It includes the Brian Tally VA Employment Transparency Act to protect  veterans' legal rights.  This legislation will make a real difference for veterans across the  country, and I am proud of the bipartisan progress we are making today.  Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.

It  is the Excelsior Underwear case.  I have done hundreds and hundreds of house visits based on the  information provided by these lists. Now, just because it has been in  operation doesn't mean it has always worked well. For years, when I was  organizing, I was given lists of names and incomplete information  scribbled across scattered sheets of paper, and somehow this complied  with the law.  I am not going to admit how long ago this was, Mr. Chairman, but it  was decades ago.  The PRO Act simply codifies the rule regarding contact information to  make it work better and modernizes it by ensuring that, among other  things, contact information is provided in electronic, searchable  format, this being the 21st century.  Now, my distinguished colleague across the aisle might attempt to  scare you with nightmares about union boogeymen coming to blow your  house down; but, in reality, not one person has ever charged a union  with abusing the voter information list since the NLRB updated its  election procedures to modernize them in 2014, 6 years ago. Not one  charge; it is completely made up.  In fact, when the Trump NLRB, a body not exactly known for being on  the side of workers, recently revamped their election procedure, they  left this rule entirely intact, just as we are attempting to codify it  in the PRO Act.  Ensuring that workers are fully informed about an organizing drive is  paramount to effective labor relations.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    "

332,John Lewis,2.9553442001342773,D,lewis,lewis," Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of "", H.R. 7120, ', the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.  For far too long, equal justice and protection under the law have  been deferred dreams for Black people and communities of color across  our country. As we consider this bill, people throughout Metro Atlanta  and throughout my home state of Georgia are gripped by pain and anguish  over the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Rayshard Brooks, Breonna Taylor,  George Floyd, Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland, Philando Castile, Tamir  Rice, Jordan Davis, who was the beloved son of our colleague  Congresswoman Lucy McBath, and countless others. The pain in the depths  of our souls is constant and all consuming. It is the seemingly endless  nightmare from which we cannot awake.  Today, young people are taking up the mantle in a movement that I  know all too well. All over the world, communities are once again  joining the call for racial equity and equality. While their feet march  towards justice, their pain, their frustration, and petitions cannot-- must not--be ignored. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act provides  us with an opportunity to practice what we preach. While we use our  speech to advance American ideals such as freedom, liberty, and justice  for all, we must use our hands to implement these values. ', H.R. 7120, '  puts us on the right path.  Many may seek to mischaracterize this legislation. Some will ignore  the opportunities that this bill presents to improve our communities.  For example, I greatly appreciate that the authors included my  proposal, the Law Enforcement Inclusion Act, which permits Federal  grant funds to be used to recruit and train officers from the  neighborhoods they are charged to protect and serve. ', H.R. 7120, "" also  provides law enforcement with the help and training they need to  address mental health, drug use, and other complex societal issues.  These proposals are partial solutions to the historic disconnect and  distrust between communities of color and law enforcement.  Others may argue that the bill does not go far enough. This  legislation addresses one Federal part of a complicated puzzle of  entrenched, systematic bias and inequality, and we cannot let the  perfect be the enemy of the good. Going forward, we must demilitarize  law enforcement and establish empathy in our justice system. Make no  mistake--much more is needed from cities, counties, State, and Federal  authorities in every corner of our country. Our work is cut out for us,  and our mandate, from those whom we were elected to represent and  serve, is clear.  Mr. Speaker, a democracy cannot thrive where power remains unchecked  and justice is reserved for a select few. Ignoring these cries and  failing to respond to this movement is simply not an option. For peace  cannot exist where justice is not served. I urge each and everyone of  our colleagues to support this legislation.    "
333,Daniel Lipinski,0.8227047920227051,D,lipinski,lipinski," Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, when I was a professor teaching American  Government before I was elected to Congress, the first thing I would do  when beginning to teach a class about Congress and the legislative  process would be to show this video. It is the 3-minute ``Schoolhouse  Rock'' cartoon video from the 1970s called ``I'm Just a Bill.''  The cartoon begins with a group of constituents calling their  Congressman with an idea for a new law. The Congressman introduces a  bill, which goes through House committee debate and amendment before a  vote to report the bill favorably to the House floor.  On the floor, the bill goes through debate and amendment before a  majority vote that sends the bill over to the Senate, where the process  continues.  This is a process that we call regular order. Regular order in the  House is a standard way of legislating that facilitates extensive  participation of Members in the deliberative, consensus-based  decisionmaking process.  More importantly, this is how the Framers of the Constitution not  only intended the House to work, but believed that the House needed to  work if the United States, then in its infancy, was to succeed.  Congress was created in Article I of the Constitution because the  legislative branch, being closest to the people, was necessarily the  linchpin of American representative democracy.  While the Framers didn't include in the Constitution the rules by  which the House and Senate would operate, they understood that the way  in which the lawmaking process was conducted was critical to the  creation of laws that were good for the Nation as a whole and to the  legitimacy of Congress and those laws.  James Madison, oftentimes called the Father of Congress, believed it  was essential that the legislative branch make policy in the manner  that well represented the vast and varied Republic and best served the  Nation as a whole.  Remember, our Nation began as a unique experiment in self-governance.  There was great doubt about whether the views of people so diverse  could successfully be forged into good policy that served such a large  nation.  Madison believed that the way to do this was for Members of Congress  to represent the multiple and diverse interests and ideas of their  constituents in an open marketplace of ideas in Congress. Through the  legislative process, the people's Representatives would debate,  deliberate, and put together a consensus on legislation that served the  common good of the Nation.  What the Constitution created was not a parliamentary system, because  the Framers did not intend to empower temporary majorities. Instead,  they wanted to compel compromise in a diverse society.  The exercise of power was shared so that all American voters had an  opportunity to be heard in the lawmaking process and to ensure that  only the will of broad, durable majorities could be acted upon.  Especially because America was a large and diverse country whose unity  needed to be nurtured, it was critical that the legislative process  worked this way so that the American people saw Congress as an  institution that truly represented them and saw American law as  legitimate.  But today, the House doesn't often work this way, especially when we  deal with issues that are of the greatest importance to our Nation.  Those bills, when they get considered, don't get shaped through an open  process in committee and on the House floor. Each Member doesn't have  the opportunity to represent their constituents by bringing their ideas  and interests in the legislative process where debate, deliberation,  and compromise produce the best policy for our Nation. Instead, the  process runs through the Speaker's Office, where the content of  legislation is shaped to get enough votes just out of the majority to  pass something that pleases various partisans.  Now, before I go any further, I want to make clear that this is not a  criticism of the current Speaker or any former Speaker. This is a  problem of our institution.  So how did we get here?  Well, there has been a big change in the way Washington reacts every  2 years after a congressional election. It used to be the case that,  when election results came in, everyone looked to see which party has  the majority in the House, who has the majority in the Senate and  whether it had 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, and which party held  the White House.  Understanding that balance of power and the issues facing our Nation  over the next 2 years, Members of Congress would get to work figuring  out what issues they may be able to come to an agreement on and get  passed into law over the next 20 months or so before the next campaign  cycle began.  Now, today, what happens is, after understanding the balance of power  in Washington after an election, each party retreats to its corner and  begins plotting what their party is going to do over the next 2 years.  If there is unified government--that is, one party has majorities in  both Chambers of Congress and the Presidency--here in the House, the  Speaker will consider the priorities of the party and decide what  issues to make their legislative priorities over the next 2 years to  create party-preferred laws and keep that majority.  If there is divided government, which is the norm, having occurred 30  out of the last 40 years, and if you include the filibuster, 39\\1/2\\  out of the last 40 years, if that is the case, the Speaker plans what  the party can do over the next 2 years to help the party gain unified  control of the government with the hope of them passing all of the  party's preferred policies. On the other side of the aisle, they figure  out what they can do over those 2 years so they can get control.  In order to help the party carry out this biennial plan, Members of  Congress have given up much of their power to represent their  constituents in the legislative process to party leaders.  So what has this led to?  Gridlock. There are so many issues we need to address in this Nation  and we fail to act: healthcare costs, the Federal debt, immigration,  climate change, the economic and military threat of China, Social  Security and Medicare finances, transportation infrastructure, the  continuing decline of good working-class jobs, and reforming the War  Powers Act.  These are just some of the major issues which Congress has been  failing [["", Page , H7037, ] to address. I am sure there are other major ones that I just missed.  The one obligation that Congress has each year--passing  appropriations bills to fund the government--is almost never  accomplished on time.  Presidents have stepped in to fill the policymaking void. They now  wield power even to address issues that were specifically put in the  hands of Congress in the Constitution.  Increased Presidential exercise of power on policy has resulted in  policy whipsawing back and forth depending on the Presidential  administration. Lawmaking by executive order has become the norm, so  much so that ``Saturday Night Live'' even did a parody of ``I'm Just a  Bill,'' replacing ``bill'' with an executive order. And this President  has taken it to a new level.  But no matter who the President has been, few of us stand up for our  institution. We only criticize Presidential overreach when it is a  policy that we don't like.  And it is not only the President who has gained power because  Congress is failing to act. The courts have also stepped in as  activists and have turned to the judicial system to settle policy  issues in the absence of Congress.  So what we have now is an imperial Presidency and powerful courts  with a Congress that largely sits gridlocked.  What happens when we have unified government in those rare times?  The last two times this occurred, major policy changes were passed on  completely party-line votes. The minority party then attacked the  legitimacy of these laws.  Now, I am not saying that these laws were illegitimate--they were  not--but the Framers knew that this kind of attack would happen if we  did not come together to forge compromises.  Now, in both these cases when unified government occurred, the last  two times it happened, in the next election the House majority was  changed by the American people.  Today, Congress is failing in ways that the Founders feared. In  Senator Lamar Alexander's farewell address to the Senate, he defended  the filibuster, saying that what is needed to make the Senate work  better is not a change of rules but a change of behavior.  Unfortunately, I believe that we need some of both.  {time} 2100  Over the past 4 years, I have been a Member of the House Problem  Solvers Caucus. The Caucus is a bipartisan group of about 50 members,  evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. We meet every week to  talk policy and build relationships. Our goal is to work together to  get to ``yes'' on policies that are good for our country. I greatly  enjoyed the Caucus because not only have I been able to build  friendships, but was able to participate in a microcosm of what Madison  envisioned for the House.  The Problem Solvers Caucus doesn't always succeed in forging  compromise because sometimes it has been out of our reach, but we have  taken on some big issues. I was part of a Problem Solvers Caucus  working group that was put together after President Trump said he was  going to eliminate DACA, and then told Speaker Pelosi and Senate  Democrat Leader Schumer he would help work out a legislative solution  to protect these immigrants who were brought to the United States as  children--the Dreamers.  The President never followed through on that, but the Caucus believed  that there was a bipartisan agreement that we could work out that  granted the opportunity for citizenship to millions, who we argued were  deserving of this, while putting into place policies to prevent future  illegal immigration.  Our working group's meetings usually started at 9 p.m. because that  was the time of day that everyone was free from every other obligation  that we have around here. We would get together--Democrats and  Republicans--learn from each other and from experts of our current law,  discuss our views and our constituents' views on what law should be,  what should be done. Honestly, work through every minute detail of a  compromise.  We worked late into the night. A few times, I had to run out to catch  the last metro train at Union Station at 11:30 so I can get back to my  apartment. It was hard work, but enjoyable. And we came up with a  compromise that was endorsed by a bipartisan group of 50 members, just  as we had come up with a compromise legislation in the same manner  which would have helped strengthen the Affordable Care Act and made it  more affordable. But in the end, despite our agreement, we could not  get legislation on either of these issues to the floor.  We had good policy for our Nation, which probably could have gotten  the majority of the House to pass it, and possibly been able to get it  through Senate with bipartisan support. We got there by bringing our  constituents' ideas and interests to the table, debating, deliberating,  forging a compromise, but the rules did not give us an avenue to bring  this agreement to the House.  In the summer of 2018, when the Problem Solvers Caucus proposed  changes to the House rules, I said this: ``Our Constitution empowered  the American people by empowering Congress and their representatives.  But Congressional rules are now rigged in a way that greatly diminishes  our ability to represent our constituents. This has resulted in a  Congress that doesn't work and is frozen in partisan gridlock, allowing  the President and the courts to grab the power that is supposed to be  held by the American people. By instituting these proposed reforms, we  will begin to restore this power, break partisan gridlock, and  facilitate congressional problem-solving that will help us build a  better America for future generations.''  We made a little bit of progress in changing rules, but much more is  needed. Much more is needed to make this great institution work as it  was intended by the Framers of the Constitution to work for the  American people, and I am hopeful that those changes will occur and the  Problem Solvers Caucus will be successful in the next couple of weeks  and in the next Congress because American people need it.  Now, despite the ways in which the House falls short these days, good  work still happens here because everyone who gets elected to the House  does so because they want to make a difference. And there are still  ways that we can succeed for our constituents.  During my time representing the people of the Third District of  Illinois, I have always said that my goal every day was to make life a  little better for my constituents and our country. And I knew that I  had a whole team of staffers there to help me.  Recently, as I was driving out to Washington, I was listening to  former Senator Al Franken's book, ``Giant of the Senate.'' As an early  ``Saturday Night Live'' watcher, I enjoyed the book very much, and  Senator Franken was very candid on a lot of things. One of the most  important truths that Franken mentioned, which is rarely spoken around  here, is that Members of Congress are never supposed to admit that  their staff was responsible for an idea or for being indispensable in  getting something done. He says that he once publicly gave credit to a  staffer for an idea, and he was told by a colleague not to do that.  It is always the Senator who has the idea and does the work, he was  told. Franken thought that was wrong, and I agree. Maybe because I was  a staffer before I was elected.  So as I look back on everything that I have done over 16 years, I  thank all the staff that worked for me over the years. These are some  of the things that we were able to accomplish. We were able to author  16 laws, and I was the chief Democratic cosponsor on 11 other laws.  Promoting American manufacturing jobs was a priority for me, having  grown up in and now representing the southwest side of Chicago. We were  able to get signed into law the Customs Training Enhancement Act to  stop illegal goods coming into the country; the Small Aircraft  Revitalization Act to help American aviation manufacturers; the Steel  and Aluminum Energy Conservation and Technology Competitiveness Act  Reauthorization to help these manufacturers thrive; and numerous Buy  America provisions that we were able to get into transportation and  other laws.  Mr. Speaker, but the one I am most proud of is the American  Manufacturing and Competitiveness Act, which took 5 years to get done  but resulted in the first comprehensive American manufacturing strategy  plan to be produced by the Federal Government since [["", Page , H7038, ] Alexander Hamilton. It is a good plan, and I am hopeful that the Biden  administration considers its recommendations.  To protect the environment against climate change, we got the H-Prize  Act and the BRIGHT Energy Savings Act into law. To protect victims of  sexual assault in the military, we got the SANE Deployment Act into an  NDAA. For veterans, we got the Purple Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal  Access Act and the Tarawa MIA Recovery Act.  As an engineer, I love the Committee on Science, Space, and  Technology. We did much on that committee to increase funding for  scientific research and to boost technological innovation activities of  the Federal Government. I was proud to author the National Science  Foundation Reauthorization Act of 2010. NSF continues to be the gold  standard of all international scientific research and innovation  agencies.  The most successful program that we were involved with has been the  Innovation Corps, or I-Corps, program. I was the nonstop promoter of  this program, which teaches university faculty and graduate students  about entrepreneurship and has helped launched dozens of startups. We  were able to grow that program at NSF and expand it to many other  Federal departments and agencies. We were also able to get an offshoot  hacking for defense set up at the DOD.  Representing the heart of the transportation hub of our Nation, we  were able to accomplish much for northeastern Illinois and the Nation  in transportation. Locally, we brought home hundreds of millions of  dollars in Federal money to improve local transportation, including  funding for roads, bridges, public transportation, sidewalks and bike  lanes, and airports.  We helped get a billion dollars for the CREATE rail modernization  program to improve the rail network in the region and alleviate some  blocked crossings. We added commuter train service on Metra's Heritage  Corridor and SouthWest Service lines. We got funding for a new tower at  Lewis University Airport and for rail underpasses in Bedford Park in  Bridgeview. Midway Airport has been made safer and more successful as  an economic engine for the southwest side.  I want to thank individually the staff here in D.C. that made all  this possible:  Staff assistants, Veronica Neuberger, Sarah Pittenger, Noah  Woodiwiss.  Legislative correspondents, Brian Freedman, Elizabeth Kelly.  Legislative assistants, Keith Devereaux, Wendy Adams, Carl Roberts,  Chris Lyons, Kim Koleos, Juri Jacoby, Emily Chibnall, Adam Weiss,  Andrew Hoffner, and Paul Dorsey.  Senior policy advisors, Joel Creswell, the late Andrew Davis, Sofya  Leonova, Jonathan Freye, Caitlyn McGuire, Ashley Musselman.  For all 16 years, our office administrator, Jennifer Sypolt.  Our communications directors over the years: Joel Reed, Phil  Davidson, the late Chris Ganschow, Nathanial Zimmer, Isaac Sancken, and  our digital press manager, Grace Graunke.  Legislative directors, John Veysey II, John Rattliff, Ryan Quinn,  Jason Day, and Alexander Beckmann.  Chiefs of staff, Jason Tai, Jaclyn O'Day, Brian Oszakiewski, Michael  McLaughlin, and Eric Lausten.  Mr. Speaker, I thank all of them for the great work that they have  done for me and for the people of the Third District of Illinois. I was  going to start naming Members that had helped me get all this work  done, but I know the danger in this business of leaving anyone out, so  I will just thank all of my colleagues for the work that we have done  together over these last 16 years.  Back in the district, we had what I would argue hands down was the  best constituent service in the Nation, whether it was helping  constituents with issues related to Social Security, Medicare,  veterans' benefits and military service, immigration issues, passport  issues, mail delivery issues, and many, many more issues.  The staff included Anthony Constantine, Yareli Cortez, Dawn Courtney,  Salvatore DiFranco, Jessica Jaroch, Chris Jutton, Joseph Kirkoff, Jean  Krupa, Josh Luke, John McGlynn, Frank Salerno, the late Zac Plantz, the  late Marianne Viverito.  Over the last few years, we have lost a number of staffers. It has  been very difficult, but we have grieved together as a staff and we are  thankful to all those departed staffers and their families.  Over the years, Jerry Hurckes was the chief of staff in the Chicago  office for most of my time in Congress and he ran that office and ran  the district for me.  Lenore Goodfriend was there for most of my time, and she is well- loved by veterans across the district.  Joe Bonomo, who is now my district director, has been with me for all  16 years. Joe has done a great job.  Paula Belmonte, who has been there 16 years also, has helped so many  immigrants, and we had a few that we saved from being deported.  And last, but not least, Jerry Mulvihill, who was probably, I would  argue, the best case worker in the history of the Congress. Jerry has  been called a saint more times than I could ever count for all the work  he did for so many people for so many years not just on Federal issues,  but any issue that anyone ever brought to Jerry. He is the only staffer  I know who was ever written up multiple times in the Chicago newspaper  for what he did for people.  Mr. Speaker, all these people made it work and did so much for all  the residents of the Third District, and I thank them so much.  Finally, I thank my mother, who gave me the love of learning; and my  father, who helped give me the love of politics; but above all, they  both gave me a love of helping others, as my mother was a teacher and  my father served in the Chicago City Council before he served here.  I also thank my wife, Judy, who thought she was marrying a lifelong  professor but then provided me with more support than I could have ever  hoped for in this job. It is only those spouses of Members who know  everything that it takes and everything they go through. So I thank  Judy so much for her support.  Lastly, I thank the people of Illinois' Third District, who gave me  the honor and privilege of serving as their representative.  {time} 2115  Mr. Speaker, the greatness of our Nation springs from the founding  principles which sound common to us today but were radical for their  time: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are  created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain  unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness.''  I still believe that this is the greatest Nation in the history of  the world. It is not perfect because humans aren't perfect, and we  cannot be perfected. But we must pray and work every day that each of  us and our Nation better uphold the principle of equality, and we had  better protect the life and liberty every day for every person, from  the very first moment of life until natural death. With God's grace, we  will do that, and we will be that shining city upon the hill for all  the world to see and follow.  God bless this institution, and God bless the United States of  America.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
334,David Loebsack,0.36837828159332275,D,loebsack,loebsack," Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this en bloc package, which  includes my amendment to increase investment of distributed wind  technologies and research within the Department of Energy's Wind Energy  Program.  Distributed wind is the use of typically smaller wind turbines owned  primarily by rural and local entities, such as homes, farms,  businesses, and public facilities to offset all or a portion of onsite  energy consumption.  This type of energy production strengthens American communities by  helping them become more energy independent while lowering costs for  consumers. Distributed wind also strengthens domestic manufacturing,  and, in fact, American-made wind turbines can be found in well over 100  countries around the world.  The funding provided over the past few fiscal years has helped  unleash distributed wind power's vast potential, but continued  investment is needed to support the critical research and development  that will further reduce costs and maximize the benefits of distributed  wind power.  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.    "
335,Zoe Lofgren,2.386359691619873,D,lofgren,lofgren," Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of "", H.R. 4990, '.  Voting is the bedrock of our representative democracy. The integrity  of our election infrastructure is essential to free and fair elections.  Votes are cast and counted using a variety of systems, from hand-marked  paper ballots to direct-recording electronic machines. There is a whole  host of other technology that also supports the process, including  electronic pollbooks, voter registration databases, and other  components of comprehensive systems.  I support ', H.R. 4990, ', the Election Technology Research Act of 2019,  because it invests in science to bolster the resilience of election  technology, and commend its sponsor, Representative Sherrill, for  authoring the bill. This legislation is in keeping with other bills  this House has passed in the 116th Congress to protect our democratic  institutions, including ', H.R. 1, ' (the For the People Act), ', H.R. 2722, ' (the  SAFE Act), and ', H.R. 4617, "" (the SHIELD Act).  Russia attacked our democracy in 2016. Special Counsel Robert  Mueller's investigation confirmed that Russian GRU officers ``targeted  individuals and entities involved in the administration of the  elections. Victims included U.S. state and local entities, such as  state boards of elections (SBOEs), secretaries of state, and county  governments, as well as individuals who worked for those entities. The  GRU also targeted private technology firms responsible for  manufacturing and administering election-related software and hardware,  such as voter registration software and electronic polling stations.''  In July 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA) published an election infrastructure risk assessment. It found  that ``compromises to the integrity of state-level voter registration  systems, the preparation of election data (e.g., ballot programming),  vote aggregation systems, and election websites present particular risk  to the ability of jurisdictions to conduct elections.''  Our elections remain under threat from foreign adversaries. In August  2020, the Director of the United States Counterintelligence and  Security Center said that foreign states may use the 2020 elections to  ``seek to compromise our election infrastructure for a range of  possible purposes, such as interfering with the voting process,  stealing sensitive data, or calling into question the validity of the  election results.''  "", H.R. 4990, ' is commonsense, bipartisan legislation that responds to  these ongoing threats. It authorizes new research and standards for  election infrastructure security. It directs the National Institute of  Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Science Foundation  (NSF) to carry out research that will increase the understanding of  cyber and other threats to voting systems. It will lead to the  development of technology, processes, and policies for more secure and  accessible elections. This includes the cybersecurity of different  components of voting systems, end-to-end verifiable systems, voter  privacy and data protection, election auditing, interoperability of  system technologies, and ballot tracking.  Importantly, the bill also amends the Help America Vote Act to expand  the definition of voting systems to include electronic pollbooks, voter  registration databases, systems for carrying out post-election  auditing, and related technology. This will lead to improved guidance  to election administrators for these systems by the Election Assistance  Commission and its partners, which include NIST.  I am pleased to support ', H.R. 4990, ' and urge its passage.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from New Jersey (Ms. Sherrill) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, ', H.R. 4990, ', as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
336,Billy Long,0.3385578691959381,R,long,long," Mr. LONG. Mr. Speaker, the Seventh Congressional District of  Missouri's economy has a significant dependence on seasonal outdoor  amusement and entertainment including the Ozark Empire Fair, the  carnivals on the midways of county fairs, and the nation's favorite  vacation spot, Branson. These for profit and not for profit enterprises  employ thousands of Ozarkians, some year-round and the majority just in  the season.  Branson in the Missouri Ozarks draws about nine million visitors a  year, mainly during a nine-month season. From the world-famous Silver  Dollar City to the celebrated country music venues and all attractions  in between, including excellent bass fishing, world class golf, youth  baseball tournaments, and endless outdoor adventures, Branson is a  premier destination in America.  But these are not normal times.  Springfield, Missouri is home to the International Association of  Fairs and Expositions (IAFE).  Agricultural Fairs--county fairs, state fairs and regional ag shows-- are deeply rooted in our heritage and history, with the mission to  promote and advance agriculture, horticulture, domestic industry, with  a focused emphasis on youth leadership development through  competitions, education, and leadership opportunities.  Most fairs, a total of 2,092 in the US, also provide exceptional  educational activities to help today's Americans understand the  importance of farming and the source of the food on their plate.  Fairs cannot function without a complex arrangement of carnival  midway operations, food and beverage operations, livestock shows,  exhibits and demonstrations. With nearly 300 fairs happening across  America in July alone [["", Page , H1863, ] each year, it is impossible to reschedule a fair for a different time.  According to the IAFE, each year the operation of agricultural fairs  results in $4.67 billion for the US economy and provides thousands of  jobs.  Fairs and their carnival partners on the midway have been devastated  by the cancellation of events thus far. IAFE estimates a loss of  revenue exceeding $1.4 billion to the fair and festival core  organizations just for March through May.  The Outdoor Amusement Business Association (OABA) represents some 200  carnivals, 15 circuses and hundreds of traveling food/game  concessionaires in the United States. The vast majority of their  members are small, family businesses, many in their third or more  generation of ownership. The OABA estimates 350 carnival events have  currently been closed through May I. Based on historical attendance  data and this estimated performance cancellations, the lost revenue to  carnival operators is near $250 million.  Should the need for social distancing or total quarantine exist into  the summer, the economic devastation will inevitably put these  community organizations as well as many of the small businesses in the  allied sectors out of business. Thousands of jobs will be lost.  Because both the not-for-profit fair sector and the outdoor amusement  business segment are unique subsets of our economic and commercial  activities, we must ensure they are not excluded from any current or  new SBA programs and they are just as eligible for federal support from  the new $500 billion fund provided to the Treasury as any Wall Street  traded company.    "
337,Barry Loudermilk,0.27701088786125183,R,loudermilk,loudermilk," Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, I thank our ranking member for not  only yielding, but his fine leadership in this committee.  I also appreciate my colleague, Mr. Gottheimer, sponsor of this  legislation. I appreciate his leadership on this, and I truly believe  he did work very hard in a bipartisan manner to try to come to an  agreement. And unfortunately, we just weren't able to close that gap.  And I hope that going forward we will be able to do that, because this  is something that we do support on this side with the certain  constraints to protect the consumers' identity.  One of my major concerns on this is cybersecurity. As was spoken  about earlier, the bill would create an online portal for consumers to  access their credit reports from all three major credit bureaus in one  place. The idea is a good idea, and very worth discussing and very  worth pursuing. But in its current state, it would be a massive amount  of sensitive data in one place, so it must be done in a way that is  cybersecure to make sure that the information doesn't lead to more  fraud and more identity theft.  As someone who has spent many years in the IT sector, as I know my  good colleague, Mr. Gottheimer, has as well, I am very concerned about  the potential of breaches of this portal.  We all remember the 2017 Equifax data breach that exposed the  financial information of millions of Americans, and the last thing we  should be doing is increasing the chance of that kind of event  happening again. But this bill has the potential to do that very thing  because it does not include robust cybersecurity protections to make  sure the information on the portal is secure.  {time} 1545  Another worthy goal of the bill is to make it easier for consumers to  dispute errors in their credit reports. But the bill allows consumers  to repeatedly dispute the same information on their credit reports,  even if it is found to be accurate, which would lead to unnecessary and  frivolous disputes.  Another significant concern I have with this bill is that it would  expand the authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The  CFPB is an unaccountable regulatory agency that took many rogue actions  under the previous administration.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle know that expanding the  CFPB's power is a nonstarter for Republicans; therefore, I cannot  support this bill. I ask my colleagues to oppose this bill.    "
338,Alan Lowenthal,0.618179976940155,D,lowenthal,lowenthal," Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of "", H.R. 2, ', the  Moving Forward Act.  This bill is the product of collaboration across House committees and  takes a bold step to rebuild our infrastructure while reducing  emissions and enhancing resilience in communities across the country.  ', H.R. 2, "" makes key improvements that will address challenges we face in  Southern California. It ensures that states can use more freight funds  for multi-modal projects, critical improvements we need at freight  hubs. It invests over $100 billion in transit and has a dedicated  program to reduce congestion on our highways. And it devotes over $100  billion to affordable housing to help make sure every American has a  place to call home.  The bill also includes a crucial provision to examine the  administration of a fee on freight transportation. I have advocated for  years to implement this fee, which would provide a sustainable revenue  stream to fund sorely-needed freight improvements.  The Moving Forward Act tackles climate change in every title. It  invests in zero-emission transit buses and port equipment, incentivizes  the development of wind and solar energy, and emphasizes resiliency to  help our communities adapt to rising sea levels. The bill also gives  key federal support to expand broadband access and re-build schools  across the country.  This legislation is a bold step forward for our nation, and I urge  all my colleagues to vote yes.  I also wish to include in the Record a letter from the Chairman of  the Board of Directors of the Coalition for America's Gateways and  Trade Corridors.  Thank you for introducing the Investing in a New Vision for   the Environment and Surface Transportation in America (INVEST   in America) Act. We appreciate the robust funding proposed in   the INVEST in America Act and particularly support the   freight investment provisions which, with proper   implementation, offer the opportunity to strengthen our   nationally and regionally significant goods movement   infrastructure. While the COVID-19 pandemic has yielded a   great deal of uncertainty, it has also shone a light on the   essential nature of our nation's supply chain infrastructure.   When much of the nation was asked to stay home, the U.S.   supply chain continued working to deliver desperately-needed   medical supplies and equipment, food, as well as everyday   items previously taken for granted.  The Coalition for America's Gateways and Trade Corridors   (CAGTC) is a diverse group of more than 60 public and private   organizations dedicated to increasing federal investment in   America's multimodal freight infrastructure. In contrast to   single mode interests, CAGTC's foremost mission is to promote   a seamless national goods movement transportation system   across all modes to enhance capacity and economic growth.  As the legislation advances, we would like to highlight the   following for your consideration:  If top-line funding levels are adjusted as the bill moves   forward, Congress should seek to increase--or at least   maintain--the funding proposed for freight infrastructure   programs, including the Nationally Significant Freight and   Highway Projects program (INFRA), Projects of National and   Regional Significance (PNRS), and the National Highway   Freight Program. Annual funding levels proposed in the INVEST   in America Act through these three programs would reach   nearly $4 billion per year whereas $12 billion annually is   needed for freight infrastructure based on previous INFRA   application rounds. Decreasing the amount of funding   available to freight projects would jeopardize our nation's   ability to move goods through the supply chain quickly, cost   effectively, and safely. Not only is an efficient national   supply chain critical for COVID-19 relief--it will also be   just as essential in supporting our nation's economic   recovery.  We applaud the proposal's continued investment in   competitive grant programs, first through the INFRA program   and subsequently under the PNRS program. Competitive grants   are critical to funding large-scale freight infrastructure   projects, which are difficult to fund through traditional   distribution methods such as formula programs.  We support the increased flexibility for funding multimodal   freight projects, reflected in both the PNRS and the National   Highway Freight Program. Freight does not move on highways   alone--where public benefit is demonstrable, federal   investment should be made available regardless of   transportation mode.  We have a concern with the PNRS program limitation that   reads: ``the project will make a significant improvement to   the movement of freight on the National Highway System.''   This limitation, which also appears in the INFRA program,   challenges certain projects that are otherwise eligible and   meet the listed merit criteria and other considerations. For   example, port modernization projects that provide public   benefit but do not have a rail component are disadvantaged.  We appreciate the evaluation and rating requirements   included in the INFRA and PNRS programs. Clearly-defined,   consistent and transparent merit-based criteria as well as   public disclosures of application scores are critical to the   integrity of and confidence in competitive grants.  We support the creation of a task force to study the   establishment and administration ofa fee on multimodal   freight transportation. In addition to participation by the   Internal Revenue Service and the Departments of   Transportation and Treasury, we recommend the task force   incorporate public and private stakeholder participation,   including perspectives offered by the supply chain industry.  We commend the incorporation of several additional programs   and policy advances that CAGTC and its membership have   championed, including: establishment of the grade crossing   separation grant program; increased funding for the   Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements   grant program; designation of a final National Multimodal   Freight Network (NMFN) and including in the NMFN designation   ports with a cargo value of at least $1 billion annually;   updates to the criteria for the National Freight Strategic   Plan; and initiation of a National Cooperative Multimodal   Freight Transportation Research Program.

339,Nita Lowey,10.302238464355469,D,lowey,lowey," Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and I  rise to address this House for the final time.  For 32 years, it has been my privilege to serve as United States  Representative from New York; and in the 116th Congress, it has been my  distinct honor to be the first chairwoman of the House Appropriations  Committee.  By wielding the power of the purse, this bill will make a profound  difference in the lives of millions of Americans and people around the  world.  I am proud to have worked with so many of my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to assemble this bill and other legislative successes. You  have challenged and inspired me, and I treasure the friendships that we  have made.  My dear friend, Kay Granger, it has been such an honor getting to  know you. Texas values, New York values, no matter what they say, we  became good friends and worked so well together. Thank you, thank you,  thank you.  I would be remiss if I did not thank the talented staff who have  worked so hard to put this bill together, led by Clerk and Staff  Director Shalanda Young, the extraordinary Shalanda Young, who is way  back there.  Thank you, Shalanda Young.  And also the extraordinary deputy staff director, Chris Bigelow. What  a team. They manage. No matter how much paper and no matter what the  challenge, they seem to be able to put it all together and get it  right.  Shalanda and Chris, I thank you--and always with an assist by my  chief of staff, Elizabeth Stanley.  I do want to thank the staff director of the State, Foreign  Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee, which I chair, Steve  Marchese.  There is one principle that has guided my 32 years in public service:  When you see a problem, whether it is here or in the district or in  another community, do something about it.  Too many people see a problem. They are good people, but they will  all go off to this personal activity or another personal activity.  Members of Congress know, when they see a problem, we have a  responsibility to address it and do something about it to make life  better for our community, the Nation, and the world. This bill does  something to crush this virus and set us on the course for a strong and  equitable recovery.  Mr. Speaker, for the last time and with a deep sense of gratitude for  the honor of serving in this House, I yield back the balance of my  time.    "

341,Frank Lucas,0.5105558037757874,R,lucas,lucas," Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. It is an  honor to be here. Discussing my Agriculture Committee chairman and my  colleague for 2\\1/2\\ years, Bob Smith, is truly an honor.  When I was sworn in, in a special election and I first surveyed this  body, one of the faces I recognized was this huge figure of a man  standing at the back brass rail. I can still almost see [["", Page , H6054, ] Bob right over there surveying the House floor and watching the  process.  Bob was one of those folks who had a quiet, calm demeanor. He was a  wonderful mentor to me in that first 6 months, then he went home to the  ranch for 2 years, and then we begged him to come back and lead the  Agriculture Committee for the next 2 years.  Bob was a wonderful mentor to me. He was a wonderful mentor to the  underclassmen. The first times that I went with the committee on trips  to understand agriculture around the world was with Bob, and he had a  diplomat's style and skill. He was firm. As Congressman Walden  remembered, he wouldn't take anything from anyone. He had a way about  him. He gained your trust and he gained your confidence.  It is hard to believe that he is not with us anymore. But Bob was one  of those folks whose personality, his heart, and his intellect were  just as big and broad as those shoulders were. I consider myself  fortunate for having served with him. I know the family will miss him  with intensity forever. But, Mr. Speaker, 89 years is a good, long  life. I can promise you in the time I served with him here, he lived it  to the fullest.  {time} 1045    "
342,Blaine Luetkemeyer,0.22862312197685242,R,luetkemeyer,luetkemeyer," Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, section 6308 enhances U.S. law  enforcement's ability to access international bank records to help  better ensure financial crimes are investigated. I am supportive of  this new and necessary provision. This new authority allows the  Departments of Treasury and Justice to issue subpoenas requiring  production of records relating to accounts held by banks outside of the  United States. This new authority would create a secondary mechanism  for seeking discovery from foreign banks separate from the Mutual Legal  Assistance Treaties (``MLATs'') or other multilateral or bilateral  agreements the United States currently maintains with many foreign  governments for this purpose. As the Departments of Justice and  Treasury implement Section 6308, I encourage them only to use this new  authority where a foreign bank operates in a jurisdiction as to which  no MLAT or other information-sharing agreement exists or where the  relevant foreign government has not satisfied its obligations under an  MLAT or other information-sharing agreement.  Many foreign countries restrict banks operating in their  jurisdictions from sharing their customers' financial or personally  identifiable information (``PII'). As a result, subpoenas issued under  section 6308 may place foreign banks in the difficult position of  either violating home country law or being in contempt for failure to  comply with a subpoena issued by the United States government. As a  result, I believe it is appropriate for the Departments of Justice and  Treasury to take into consideration conflict of laws situations to  achieve the purposes of Section 6308 while also maintaining a respect  for home country requirements.  Finally, I encourage the Departments of Treasury and Justice to issue  regulations establishing appropriate protocols to ensure that the  authority granted under section 6308 does not supersede or supplant  existing MLATs or other multilateral or bilateral agreements between  the United States and the relevant foreign government that are  available for obtaining records from a foreign bank.

This NDAA will provide the  tools and resources essential to maintaining our national security.  I am pleased that the conference report includes a 3 percent pay  raise for our troops and invests robustly in initiatives to compete  with China, Russia, and others who threaten our security around the  world.  The conference report includes vital investments in our fleet, our  readiness, and continued construction of the Virginia-class submarine  and the modernization of our nuclear deterrence through the Columbia- class submarine.

345,Stephen Lynch,1.0410737991333008,D,lynch,lynch," Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Subcommittee on National  Security, I want to rise in strong support of "", H.R. 8015, "", the Delivering  for America Act.  This urgent legislation would reverse the ill-advised changes to mail  delivery that the new Postmaster General has implemented to the injury  of every American's right to vote, and at a serious peril to our  democracy.  In my own district, in the city of Boston and city of Brockton, the  Postal Service has removed at least six high-capacity mail sorting  machines in the mail facility in South Boston, and two more from the  postal processing and distribution center in the city of Brockton,  causing a 4- to 5-day delay right now in the city of Brockton.  {time} 1400  Why would someone do that 10 days before a congressional primary in  Massachusetts in the midst of a pandemic when people are being asked to  vote by mail in order to keep themselves safe?  Mr. Speaker, I was elected on 9/11, the day of the terrorist attacks  on our country. As horrific as that day was, I feel proud that our  Nation came together, as Americans do in difficult times. We mourned  our fallen heroes. We tried to comfort their families. And we turned to  face our adversary together, Democrat and Republican.  Looking back, I believe our democracy was less in danger then than it  is today. I say that for two reasons. First, because we were united  then, and we are divided today. And we know who divides us. Secondly,  back then, the threat was external. But today, at this moment, the  greatest threat to our democracy is the current administration.  I call on my colleagues: Stand together. Stand together and defend  democracy. Defend your own constituents' right to vote. I urge my  colleagues to vote in favor of "", H.R. 8015, "".  Defend democracy. You will miss it when it is gone.

346,Tom Malinowski,1.759255051612854,D,malinowski,malinowski," Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, they condemned Canada for doing exactly  the same thing a few months ago.  I don't believe they expect us to do it. They surely expect us to  condemn them. They surely expect us to slap a few sanctions on their  leadership, as the State Department did today, which I am fine with.  But they do not expect us to use the strength of our society against  the weakness of theirs by opening our doors to Hong Kongers fleeing  persecution, giving them that option that is being denied to them in  Hong Kong itself.  So let's stand by the brave people of Hong Kong. Let's make the  Chinese Communist Party uncomfortable, as this sure will, and let's do  it in the best traditions of America's openness to people seeking  freedom from oppression around the world.

President Trump has suggested that all of the witnesses are Never  Trumpers. That couldn't be further from the truth. As we just saw,  these U.S. officials are brave public servants. It is wrong--just flat  wrong--to suggest they were doing anything other than testifying out of  a sense of duty, as Lieutenant Colonel Vindman testified.  But it wasn't just U.S. officials whose reactions show us that this  was wrong; it is also clear how corrupt this scheme was because Ukraine  resisted it. President Zelensky was elected as a reformer. His first  few months in office lived up to this promise.  Here is Ambassador Taylor testifying on this point. Let's see it.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador TAYLOR. But once I arrived in Kyiv, I discovered   a weird combination of encouraging, confusing, and ultimately   alarming circumstances.  First, the encouraging. President Zelensky was reforming   Ukraine in a hurry. He appointed reformist ministers and   supported long-stalled anti-corruption legislation. He took   quick executive action, including opening Ukraine's High   Anti-Corruption Court. With a new parliamentary majority   stemming from snap elections, President Zelensky changed the   Ukraine Constitution to remove absolute immunity from Rada   deputies, the source of raw corruption for two decades. The   excitement in Kyiv was palpable. This time could be   different, a new Ukraine finally breaking from its corrupt,   post-Soviet past.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. So we know that President Zelensky was a  reformer, fighting corruption, fighting for reform, and he got started  early, as soon as he was sworn in. We know that President Zelensky's  agenda was in our U.S. national interest. In fact, every witness  testified that President Zelensky deserved America's support and that  they told President Trump that.  So keeping that in mind, it is extremely telling what President  Zelensky and his aides were saying behind closed doors. They were  concerned about being dragged into President Trump's scheme. They  recognized the political peril of going along with the President's  corrupt scheme. We know that was the case for many reasons, but let's  look at some of the evidence showing that now.  First, the Ukrainians made their concerns clear directly to U.S.  officials. On July 20, just days ahead of the July 25 call, Ambassador  Taylor spoke with President Zelensky's national security advisor. He  then conveyed to Ambassadors Sondland and Volker that the Ukrainian  leader ``did not want to be used as a pawn in a U.S. reelection  campaign.''  Here is Ambassador Taylor explaining what he understood that to mean.  Let's watch.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)    "

350,Roger Marshall,0.6155687570571899,R,marshall,marshall," Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, this month, after 40 years of service as a  Member of Congress, our senior Senator of Kansas will be moving his  belongings out of his office in the Hart Senate Office Building to a  private library.  To best honor him, I would like to share some of his original wit,  some of the quips for which he is most famous. Number one:  Take your job seriously, but not yourself.  There are no self-made men or women in public service. It   is your family, friends, and staff who have made you what you   are.  Another couple of favorites:  You are only as good as your staff.  It isn't the best possible bill; it is the best bill   possible.  In reference to an opponent who sometimes disagrees with you, he  suggested:  Go smother them with the milk of human kindness.  On his commitment to agriculture, he said:  We live in a troubled and hungry world.  Food security is national security.  When asked about why we need agriculture programs, the Senator once  said:  You can't eat a shoe.  On life, when asked about making a mistake, he suggested that:  You go hunker down and take it like a donkey in a   hailstorm.  He once said:  Remember, when you roll around with pigs, you both get   dirty, but only one of you enjoys it.  On sports, at football games, he often said:  Throw the ball to the tight end. He was wide open.  And, of course, as we all know, the Senator was the unofficial tight  end coach for the ever-optimistic and fighting Kansas State Wildcats.  At a townhall, when a rabid constituent gave a forceful opposing  opinion, he once replied:  I'll mark you down as undecided.  I loved when he referred to Kansas University as that school over by  Baker.  The Senator, once a marine, was always a marine. He was often quoted  saying ``take the hill'' and ``semper fi.''  But my personal favorite:  There are lots of cactuses in the world, but you don't have   to go sit on every one.  When I first meet successful, influential people, people who I have  read about or know of, I have often asked myself: Is there any  substance to this person? Is there character and integrity? What is  truly important to them?  I would like to share, as we have gotten to know Senator Roberts and  his wife, Franki, I have found that their footprints are larger than  their shadows, their hearts are bigger than their words, their love of  this country, their love of Kansas, more than any words I can find to  describe.  Personally, I cannot imagine any memory of Senator Roberts without  thinking of his bride, his South Carolina magnolia blossom, as he often  called her, whom he married some 51 years ago. She is absolutely his  rock, the person I always see standing beside him with adoring eyes.  While occasionally she gives him a gentle nudge, everyone knows she  always has his back.  Laina and I want to personally thank Senator Roberts and Franki, who  have embraced us with hospitality and kindness since arriving ourselves  in Washington, D.C., some 4 years ago. They have shown us what it is to  be an ambassador for our State. From Christmas gatherings at the White  House to farm bill hearings in a barn, they have shown what servant  leadership looks like, representing our State with dignity and grace.  Senator Roberts is the only person in American history to have his  portrait in both the House Agriculture Committee and the Senate  Agriculture Committee hearing rooms.  Senator Roberts has had a hand in writing eight farm bills. He has  been on a Federal congressional agriculture committee for 40 years  running. Some of his greatest accomplishments include those eight farm  bills, and I am going to reference two of them.  The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, which he  was the primary author and chairman, this became known as the Freedom  to Farm bill.  Chairman Roberts has often told the story--I have heard this maybe  once or twice--of sitting on the tongue of the wagon of a farmer in  Dodge City, Kansas, with all of his farm experts, and his good friend,  Leon Torline said: Pat, we all need freedom to farm.  Sure enough, this agriculture policy gave producers the freedom to  plant crops based on market indicators, not Federal Government set- aside policies.  Next, I will reference the first farm bill I participated in, the  Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, on which he was the primary author  as chairman. Probably most notably, this farm bill received more votes  than any farm bill in modern history, with 87 in favor.  I would like to also mention the 2016 National Bioengineered Food  Disclosure Act. This Federal legislation created standards for labeling  food with ingredients derived from biotechnology.  Then his 2000 Agriculture Risk Protection Act reformed national crop  insurance and led to its widespread use today.  Finally, I will mention Senator Roberts was always the leader in bio- agro security legislation. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services  Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, Senator Roberts  chaired the first Senate hearing on the threat to our Nation's food  supply.  I will close with this. Though Senator Roberts will always be known  for his wit, being an entertaining speaker, and a great interview, his  actions and his accomplishments will always speak louder than any of  his words.  He and Franki have been tremendous ambassadors for agriculture, for  Kansas, and for America. They have climbed many mountains, and they  have planted the flag.  Senator Roberts, semper fi. May God richly bless you, Franki, and  your family.    "

Is this  part of some vast conspiracy? No. It's part of a decade's long  realignment process where the post office is trying to match the needs  of the consumers to the post office infrastructure.  These voter suppression conspiracies, who knows what the Democrats  will blame next. Last month they were blaming the Census, this month  they are blaming the post office, probably next month they will blame  Amtrak.  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch), the chair of the  Subcommittee on National Security for the Committee on Oversight and  Reform.    "
352,Brian Mast,0.8645675182342529,R,mast,mast," Mr. MAST. ``Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called  children of God.''  Madam Speaker, I rise today because the life and sacrifice of a true  peacemaker, Trooper Joseph Bullock, will be honored by our passing of  legislation to rename the postal facility in Port Salerno, Florida, as  the Joseph Bullock Post Office Building.  Though he knew the risk, his story is not how a watch should end. And  as we see his name each day in Port Salerno, we will be reminded of the  valor within all of our law enforcement who, each day, commit to our  communities the most significant thing that they have: their life.  Trooper Bullock, we salute you.    "
353,Doris Matsui,2.205251455307007,D,matsui,matsui," Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of two of my  bills being considered today: the FASTER Act and the MODERN Labeling  Act.  There are more than 32 million Americans living with potentially  life-threatening food allergies who rely on accurate food ingredient  labels to make safe decisions for themselves and their family members.  Under current law, mandatory labeling is required for major food  allergens recognized by the FDA, like milk, eggs, and peanuts. My  grandson Robby has a peanut allergy, and for families like mine,  checking food labels is as vital to our everyday lives as breathing.  Unfortunately, FDA labeling requirements do not include the  ingredient sesame, leaving more than 1.6 million Americans with a  sesame allergy in the dark about what foods and products to avoid. That  is why I have been working closely with my colleagues and advocates in  the food allergy community to advance the FASTER Act, legislation that  updates food allergen labeling laws to include sesame.  Importantly, the FASTER Act also lays critical groundwork for  conducting the research necessary to better understand, treat, and, one  day, prevent food allergies.  From ingredients in a food product to the prescribing information for  a prescription drug, FDA labels play a critical role in protecting  public health and empowering Americans to make safe decisions.  This year, our friends in the cancer community brought a real problem  to my attention. Despite the important role drug labels play in  informing treatment decisions, many generic drug labels are  considerably out of date, and there is no existing mechanism to update  these labels to reflect new clinical evidence.  That is why I introduced the MODERN Labeling Act, legislation that  supports FDA's ability to require modifications to outdated generic  drug labels so they reflect new, relevant information.  Accurate, up-to-date generic drug labels are key to optimizing use,  enhancing patient benefit, and facilitating greater use of lower cost  generics.  These are both important labeling laws, and both labeling bills are  bipartisan, commonsense solutions that take important steps to  safeguard our public health. I urge my colleagues to support the FASTER  Act and the MODERN Labeling Act.    "
354,Ben McAdams,1.7404842376708984,D,mcadams,mcadams," Mr. McADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to say farewell to this institution  that I have been so lucky and honored to serve.  I want to first thank my wife, Julie, for supporting my career in  public service for the past 12 years and for these last 2 years while I  have been a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. It is an  understatement to say that I could not have done this job without her,  both in terms of her unconditional love and support, for taking care of  our family while I have traveled back and forth to Washington, and as a  thought partner, sounding board, strategic adviser, moral conscience,  and North Star. Any time that I was faced with a politically difficult  dilemma, she would tell me to follow my conscience and stand for what I  believe in.  I want to also thank my four children: James, Kate, Robert, and  Isaac: Your humor, love, and support have kept me going even when  things get tough. Thank you for allowing me to pursue this great  adventure, and I am looking forward to more evenings at home with the  four of you.  I also want to thank my staff. I know that I have had one of the best  staffs on Capitol Hill, and it is a testament to their hard work and  their perseverance that we were able to accomplish as much as we did.  So to Nichole, Tiffany, Alyson, Eric, Michelle, Andrea, Chris, Brennen,  Julianne, Katie, Christian, Marcus, Hannah, and Stephanie, thank you.  To the people of Utah who granted to me this opportunity, thank you.  I also thank my House colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, for your  ideas, for our constructive disagreements. For those who shared my  desire to work together to find solutions to our challenges, I am  grateful.  Mr. Speaker, I packed up my Washington, D.C., office this week with  mixed emotions: pride in the work that I accomplished to support Utah's  hardworking families, but frustrated at what did not get done. Nothing  captures it quite like the failure to deliver to date much-needed  emergency relief due to the coronavirus.  We see this catastrophe happening in Utah and around the country.  People are dying; people are sick; people are hurting economically;  small businesses are on the brink of failure, and many have already  failed. It is time for each and every one of us to step forward and to  do our part.  It is long past time for Congress to put the partisanship and  politics aside and to do its job, to get it done and to show results. A  bill that does not pass the House and Senate and get signed by the  President means nothing to struggling businesses or to a struggling  family.  The partisan divide has taken a toll on public confidence in  government's ability to meet the challenges we were elected to solve.  Americans recognize their distrust of the Federal Government and each  other is a problem that gets in the way of solving tough issues. A new  type of polarization is gripping the country.  As one researcher noted: ``This level of political divisiveness on  both sides creates a feedback loop of hatred and leaves the U.S. open  to manipulation by foreign powers that wish to further these internal  rifts.''  I have tried to counter that in my public service by walking a  centrist path: to heal and to listen where I can, to hear from all  sides, and to find common ground.  I believe it is important to elect people willing to work across the  aisle, people like me who build bridges rather than fan the flames. I  have seen this work, whether it is working with Republicans to counter  the alarming rise in the rate of suicide or traveling to our southern  border to get agreement for emergency food, housing, and medical aid  for refugees fleeing violence and danger in their home countries. Once  you learn that people in both parties agree on both humanitarian  treatment and securing the border, efforts can focus on ironing out the  details.  I was proud to represent Utah's Fourth Congressional District during  the 116th Congress, serving my community, my State, and my country as  an elected Representative in the people's House. This was a great honor  and a privilege. I am glad to have carried out their good ideas across  the finish line, including four bills expected to be signed into law.  I have built relationships with Republicans and Democrats that led to  success on clean air, stopping child trafficking, preventing suicide,  and recovering investment savings for hardworking seniors cheated by  fraudsters.  My wish this holiday season for those who serve next year in Congress  is to be less partisan and more like Utahns who see the best in each  other, who work together, roll up their sleeves, and solve problems  together for the good of everyone.  Godspeed, and may God bless the United States of America.    "
355,Lucy McBath,1.8496191501617432,D,mcbath,mcbath," Mrs. McBATH. Mr. Speaker, I am so excited to be here on the floor  today to congratulate Rabbi Larry Sernovitz on becoming the senior  rabbi of Temple Kol Emeth in Marietta, Georgia.  In just the few short months that I have known the rabbi, he has been  instrumental in helping to spread our shared message of God's love for  all people and tikkun olam.  ``Tikkun olam'' translates to ``repair of the world,'' and I know  that, together, our community in Georgia will help build bridges to a  better and more just tomorrow.  I congratulate the rabbi on his new mission from God. Our community  is blessed to have been gifted a leader like him.  I hope that, if he or his congregation ever need assistance from my  office, they don't hesitate to call upon us. I truly look forward to  working with the rabbi and the Jewish community in Georgia for many  years to come, and I wish them all a happy and blessed Hannukah season.    "

Since coming to Congress in 2007, one of my most important priorities  in this Chamber has been to protect and improve the benefits that our  Nation's veterans have earned and deserve. I introduced the VET TEC  Expansion Act and the Reducing Veteran Homelessness Act earlier this  Congress in response to comments and feedback I received from veterans  and veterans organizations throughout my district and across the  country.  Both pieces of legislation seek to build upon existing veterans  benefits programs, including the VET TEC pilot program and the HUD-VA  Supportive Housing Program, by expanding and streamlining them for  veterans and veterans service providers who utilize them.  The VET TEC Expansion Act will continue to ensure that our heroes can  enhance skills they developed in the military when returning to private  life by providing access to nontraditional and technology-oriented  courses through the VET TEC pilot program. This bill would expand VET  TEC to include part-time courses and permit additional course providers  into the VET TEC pilot program.  I am also pleased that "", H.R. 7105, "", like the initial House-passed  version of this bill, would increase the VET TEC funding authorization  by $30 million per year through 2023 to help the VA meet demand for  this popular program with our veterans.  In addition, no veteran in my district or anywhere in the country  should be homeless due to unnecessary VA staffing vacancies. The  Reducing Veteran Homelessness Act would require that the VA contract  out any consistently vacant HUD-VA Supportive Housing case management  positions to community experts so that unused housing vouchers can be  matched with homeless veterans who need them the most.  Finally, I want to take a moment to thank Dr. Roe for his unwavering  commitment to our Nation's veterans throughout his time in this  Congress, specifically as chairman and ranking member of the House  Veterans' Affairs Committee over the course of the past 4 years and for  his own personal service to the United States Army, serving in Korea.  His strong leadership on behalf of our fellow veterans has been  unwavering since he came to Congress, and his tenacity, knowledge, and  friendship will be missed in this Chamber after he retires from  Congress.  On behalf of a very grateful Nation, we thank Dr. Roe for his  servant's heart, for putting the veterans first, and for improving the  quality of the care for them.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join  me in supporting this bipartisan bill and thanking Congressman Roe for  his service.    "
359,Michael McCaul,5.0897016525268555,R,mccaul,mccaul," Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to also thank my good friend  from Texas for his service to the Nation.  The United States has a special partnership with Israel. In the past  4 years, we have strengthened this relationship while taking steps  toward peace in the Middle East under the Abraham Accords with Bahrain,  Sudan, and the UAE. This has made Israel and the entire Middle East  safer.  However, Israel still faces threats from malign actors like Iran that  seek to sow chaos and spread terror. In fact, earlier today, Iranian  President Rouhani directly threatened Israel by promising to support  Syria's aggression in the Golan Heights.  I am pleased the final bill bolsters cooperation between our  countries and fully funds the security assistance to Israel. It also  improves the laws on the books so that we can quickly supply Israel  with precision-guided missiles to defend themselves against malign  actors in the region.  This bill also enhances cooperation between our two nations by  establishing a defense acquisition advisory group.  As an NDAA conferee, I am proud this year's bill includes provisions  that support Israel and deepen our partnership.  Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would like to take a moment of  personal privilege to honor my colleague, my friend, my fellow Texan,  Congressman Mac Thornberry. His leadership on the House Armed Services  Committee has made our country stronger.  I am proud to have served with him in the Congress where we have  worked together on key national security issues, including the year's  NDAA which bears his name.  But most importantly, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to call him my friend.  He has brought dignity and bipartisanship to this Chamber.  For that, sir, we are forever grateful.    "
360,Tom McClintock,0.06958094984292984,R,mcclintock,mcclintock," Mr. McCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, let's get this straight. The small  shopkeeper who has lost their entire savings because of the lockdowns  will get the same $2,000 grant as the government bureaucrat who has  been enjoying a steady paycheck at home for the past 10 months.  This money is wholly inadequate for those who have been harmed by the  lockdowns and wholly unnecessary for those who have not.  This free money doesn't come from Heaven. It comes from the future  earnings of those who will be struggling to get back on their feet,  making the post-lockdown recovery more difficult and prolonged.  Much of the burden of this debt will fall on the young, who have  already borne the brunt of these lockdowns. It is, in a real sense, a  massive wealth transfer from the future to the present, from the young  to the old, and from those who have been hurt by the lockdowns to those  who have not.  There is only one way to end the suffering caused by these lockdowns,  and that is to end them.    "
361,Betty McCollum,1.4245418310165405,D,mccollum,mccollum," Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, restoring this land to the Leech Lake  reservation will support Tribal communities while also preserving the  area for public recreation. It will allow the Tribe to consistently  apply their forest management plan across a greater portion of the  reservation. It will also respect all the rights of ways of the utility  permits.  It will be good for Leech Lake Band, good for the forest, and good  for local communities. And it will be good to correct a historical  injustice.  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for ', S. 199, '.  Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, as was just explained by my colleague across the aisle,  ', S. 199, ' would place approximately 11,000 acres of Federal land managed  by the U.S. Forest Service into trust for the Leech Lake Band. [[', Page , H6099, ]  The Tribe and the lands that would be held into trust under this bill  are located in the Eighth Congressional District, which is represented  by Republican Congressman Pete Stauber. I want to thank Mr. Stauber for  his hard work on this legislation because, without it, we would not be  here today.  After the House companion bill, ', H.R. 733, ', was introduced by  Congresswoman McCollum, it was determined that a number of the parcels  affected by the bills had encumbrances, mainly those of public utility  co-ops.  This was, again, another bill that was not properly vetted prior to  introduction by a Member from this district. I truly believe that,  since that time, Congressman Stauber has been a leader in efforts to  bring the Tribe and several utility co-ops together to come to a legal  agreement to resolve those issues with these easements.  We have some concerns regarding the enforceability of this document  but appreciate the willingness of all parties to seek a consensus. I  think that is the important part today, that there is finally a  consensus on this issue. That is a policy the Natural Resources  Committee majority has little interest in pursuing because,  unfortunately, ', S. 199, "" does not reflect this improvement in the bill  text. Let's hope the parties will continue to act in good faith despite  this.  I, again, thank Mr. Stauber for his efforts and the members of the  committee who worked across the aisle to make this happen today. I am  pleased he joined our committee during this year. He has been one of  the more active members of the committee during his short tenure.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
362,Betty McCollum,1.4245418310165405,D,mccollum,mccollum," Mr. McCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.    "
363,Donald McEachin,1.093408226966858,D,mceachin,mceachin," Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of ', H.R. 1, ', the For  the People Act, and the need for Federal election reform.  Mr. Speaker, in the 2016 and 2018 election cycles, we witnessed overt  discrimination, disinformation, and intimidation tactics aimed at  disenfranchising our most vulnerable friends and neighbors.  Individuals and organizations intentionally aimed to spread deceptive  material regarding the time and place of elections, endorsements, and  voter eligibility. Moreover, there were also explicit attempts to  intimidate voters at the polls.  In my home, the Commonwealth of Virginia, there were reports of a man  standing in front of a polling place holding a Trump sign with a  barking German shepherd on the roof of his truck, and yet that man  broke no laws.  Such efforts can interfere with one of our basic rights as Americans:  the right to vote. As such, I am pleased that ', H.R. 1, ' includes language  from a bill I introduced in the last Congress with then-Ranking Member  Nadler, the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.  This language will prohibit the dissemination of false information  regarding Federal elections and prevent efforts to hinder, interfere,  or prevent a person from voting, registering to vote, or helping  another person to vote or register to vote. We, as Americans, shall  make it easier to vote, not harder, and this language will further that  goal.  In the same vein, I am equally proud that another bill has been  included in ', H.R. 1, ', the Election Day Holiday Act, which I cointroduced  with Congresswoman Eshoo in the last Congress. As the title suggests,  this bill would direct Federal agencies to treat election day as a  holiday and urge private employers to do the same. [[', Page , H233, ]  Going to the polls is among the most democratic of American  traditions. Making election day a holiday would honor that tradition,  while helping voters to continue it long into the future.  I thank my friend and colleague, Congressman Sarbanes, for  introducing this historic bill. I thank all of the many Members and  stakeholders who have helped shape this bill and who have seen fit to  support the measures I have described.  As the name indicates, this bill is for the people, and I look  forward to the day when we do the people's work and pass it.    "
364,James McGovern,1.080399990081787,D,mcgovern,mcgovern," Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to  me.  Madam Speaker, across America, people are dealing with a loss of a  job, a business, or even a loved one. People are hurting, and they are  hurting badly not only from this pandemic, but also from the  incompetence, the callousness, and the negligence of the current  occupant of the White House.  When I talk about people hurting, I don't mean big corporations or  Fortune 500 companies. I am talking about our workers, our middle  class, those on the edge of the middle class, and those struggling in  poverty. That is where our focus should be. And thanks to the  bipartisan efforts of Members on both sides of the Capitol, we are  acting right now--not next year or during the next administration, as  some have suggested--but right now.  This deal is not everything I want--not by a long shot--but the  choice before us is simple. It is about whether [["", Page , H7293, ] we help families or not. It is about whether we help small businesses  and restaurants or not. It is about whether we boost SNAP benefits and  strengthen antihunger programs or not. And it is about whether we help  those dealing with a job loss or not.  To me, this is not a tough call. We need to pass this, and then we  need to prepare to build on it in the next Congress, hopefully, in a  bipartisan fashion and with an administration that actually gives a  damn about the American people.  Madam Speaker, before I conclude, I also join the gentleman from  Oklahoma in recognizing the service of Congresswoman Shalala. Over the  years, she has had many titles: Doctor, treasurer, college president,  chancellor, assistant secretary, secretary, congresswoman--and I could  go on.  Often, Donna has done it first: She was among the very first Peace  Corps volunteers. She was the first woman to lead a Big 10 Conference  college. She was only the second woman to lead a major research  university. And Donna was the first Lebanese American to serve in a  President's Cabinet.  Madam Speaker, there is a saying in Arabic, which in English is: ``Do  good and throw it into the sea.''  It means this: The reward is doing good. Not the praise or  recognition. Just simply an act of doing good.  And Donna Shalala does good, period. I know she will continue to do  good.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.    "
365,Patrick McHenry,0.6255089044570923,R,mchenry,mchenry," Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report  to the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2021.  Combating illicit finance and targeting bad actors is a nonpartisan  issue. However, Congress' actions must be thoughtful and data-driven.  An example of this is "", H.R. 2514, "", the COUNTER Act, which is included  in this conference report. Division G is a compilation of bipartisan  policies that will modernize and reform the Bank Secrecy Act and anti- money laundering regimes. These policies will strengthen the Department  of Treasury's financial intelligence, anti-money laundering, and  counter terrorism programs. I would like to thank Chairman Cleaver and  Ranking Member Stivers for their work on this bill and the language  included in Division G.  In addition to Division G, the conference report contains an  amendment replacing the text of "", H.R. 2513, ', the Corporate Transparency  Act, with new legislation. ', H.R. 2513, ', which passed the House on October  22, 2019, and again as an amendment to ', H.R. 6395, "" on July 21, 2020,  attempted to establish a new beneficial ownership information reporting  regime to assist law enforcement in tracking down terrorists and other  bad actors who finance terrorism and illicit activities. But, it did so  to the detriment of America's small businesses.  Beneficial ownership information is the personally identifiable  information (PII) on a company's beneficial owners. This information is  currently collected and held by financial institutions prior to a  company gaining access to our financial system.  However, bad actors and nation states, such as China and Russia, are  becoming more proficient in using our financial system to support  illicit activity. As bad actors become more sophisticated, so to must  our tools to deter and catch them. One such tool is identifying the  beneficial owners of shell companies, which are used as fronts to  launder money and finance terrorism or other illicit activity.  Beneficial ownership information assists law enforcement to better  target these bad actors.  Although well-intentioned, "", H.R. 2513, ' had numerous deficiencies in its  reporting regime. First, ', H.R. 2513, "" placed numerous reporting and costly  reporting requirements on small businesses. It lacked protections to  properly protect small businesses' personal information stored with a  little-known government office within the Department of Treasury--known  as FinCEN. The bill authorized access to this sensitive information  without any limitation on who could access the information and when it  could be accessed. Finally, it failed to hold FinCEN accountable for  its actions.  The text of "", H.R. 2513, ' is replaced with new language that I  negotiated, along with Senate Banking Committee Chairman Crapo. This  substitute, which is reflected in Division F of the conference report,  is a significant improvement over the House-passed bill in three key  areas.  First, Division F limits the burdens on small businesses. Unlike ', H.R. 2513, "", the language included in the conference report protects our  nation's small businesses. It prevents duplicative, burdensome, and  costly reporting requirements for beneficial ownership data from being  imposed in two ways. It rescinds the current beneficial ownership  reporting regime set out in 31 CFR 1010.230 (b)-(j), which is costly  and burdensome to small businesses. Rescinding these provisions ensures  that it cannot be used in a future rule to impose another duplicative,  reporting regime on America's small businesses. In addition, Division F  requires the Department of Treasury to minimize the burdens the new  reporting regime will have on small businesses, including eliminating  any duplicative requirements.  House Republicans ensured the directive to minimize burdens on small  businesses is fulfilled. Division F directs the Secretary of the  Treasury to report to the House Committee on Financial Services and the  Senate Committee on Banking annually for the first three years after  the new rule is promulgated. The report must assess: the effectiveness  of the new rule; the steps the Department of Treasury [["", Page , H6933, ] took to minimize the reporting burdens on reporting entities, including  eliminating duplicative reporting requirements, and the accuracy of the  new rule in targeting bad actors. The Department of Treasury is also  required to identify the alternate procedures and standards that were  considered and rejected in developing its new reporting regime. This  report will help the Committees understand the effectiveness of the new  rule in identifying and prosecuting bad actors. Moreover, it will give  the Committees the data needed to understand whether the reporting  threshold is sufficient or should be revised.  Second, Division F includes the strongest privacy and disclosure  protections for America's small businesses as it relates to the  collection, maintenance, and disclosure of beneficial ownership  information. The new protections set out in Division F ensure that  small business beneficial ownership information will be protected just  like an individual's tax return information. The protections in  Division F mirror or exceed the protections set out in 26 U.S.C. 6103,  including:  1. Agency Head Certification. Division F requires an agency   head or designee to certify that an investigation or law   enforcement, national security or intelligence activity is   authorized and necessitates access to the database. Designees   may only be identified through a process that mirrors the   process followed by the Department of Treasury for those   designations set out in 26 U.S.C. 6103.  2. Semi-annual Certification of Protocols. Division F   requires an Agency head to make a semi-annual certification   to the Secretary of the Treasury that the protocols for   accessing small business ownership data ensure maximum   protection of this critically important information. This   requirement is non-delegable.  3. Court authorization of State, Local and Tribal law   enforcement requests. Division F requires state, local and   tribal law enforcement officials to obtain a court   authorization from the court system in the local   jurisdiction. Obtaining a court authorization is the first of   two steps state, local and tribal governments must take prior   to accessing the database. Separately, state, local and   tribal law enforcement agencies must comply with the   protocols and safeguards established by the Department of   Treasury.  4. Limited Disclosure of Beneficial Ownership Information.   Division F prohibits the Secretary of Treasury from   disclosing the requested beneficial ownership information to   anyone other than a law enforcement or national security   official who is directly engaged in the investigation.  5. System of Records. Division F requires any requesting   agency to establish and maintain a system of records to store   beneficial ownership information provided directly by the   Secretary of the Treasury.  6. Penalties for Unauthorized Disclosure. Division F   prohibits unauthorized disclosures. Specifically, the   agreement reiterates that a violation of appropriate   protocols, including unauthorized disclosure or use, is   subject to criminal and civil penalties (up to five years in   prison and $250,000 fine).  Third, Division F contains the necessary transparency, accountability  and oversight provisions to ensure that the Department of Treasury  promulgates and implements the new beneficial ownership reporting  regime as intended by Congress. Specifically, Division F requires each  requesting agency to establish and maintain a permanent, auditable  system of records describing: each request, how the information is  used, and how the beneficial ownership information is secured. It  requires requesting agencies to furnish a report to the Department of  Treasury describing the procedures in place to ensure the  confidentiality of the beneficial ownership information provided  directly by the Secretary of the Treasury.  Separately, Division F requires two additional audits. First, it  directs the Secretary of Treasury to conduct an annual audit to  determine whether beneficial ownership information is being collected,  stored and used as intended by Congress. Separately, Division F directs  the Government Accountability Office to conduct an audit for five years  to ensure that the Department of Treasury and requesting agencies are  using the beneficial ownership information as set out in Division F.  This is the same audit that GAO conducts as it relates to the  Department of Treasury's collection, maintenance and protection of tax  return information. This information will ensure that Congress has  independent data on the efficacy of the reporting regime and whether  confidentiality is being maintained.  Division F also requires the Department of Treasury to issue an  annual report on the total number of court authorized requests received  by the Secretary to access the database. The report must detail the  total number of court authorized requests approved and rejected and a  summary justifying the action. This report to Congress will ensure the  Department of Treasury does not misuse its authority to either approve  or reject court authorized requests.  Finally, Division F requires the Director of FinCEN, who is  responsible for implementing this reporting regime, to testify annually  for five years. This testimony is critical. For far too long FinCEN has  evaded any type of congressional check on its activities. Yet, it has  amassed a great deal of authority. Now, Congress will shine a light on  its operations. It is my expectation that FinCEN will provide Congress  with hard data on its effectiveness in targeting bad actors, including  the effectiveness of this new authority to collect, maintain, and use  beneficial ownership information.  One final comment about the importance of FinCEN's annual testimony.  In the months leading up to the House's consideration of "", H.R. 2513, ' last  October, I sought data from FinCEN and from the Treasury Department,  along with the Department of Justice, to better understand the need for  this legislation. No such data was forthcoming. Rather, FinCEN gave  anecdotes of very scary stories to justify the need for a new reporting  regime. It is my expectation that FinCEN will provide Congress with the  necessary data to justify this new reporting regime and the burdens it  is placing on legitimate companies.  I will conclude by thanking Chairwoman Maloney for her work over the  last twelve years on this issue and her willingness to work with me to  strengthen this bill. I believe we have a better product.  I urge my colleagues to support the conference agreement.    "
366,David McKinley,0.978335440158844,R,mckinley,mckinley," Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of ', H.R. 3361, "", the RIVER Act, and thank  Chairman Tonko and Congressman Loebsack for working with us in a  bipartisan way on this important legislation.  This RIVER Act reauthorizes key hydropower production and efficiency  incentives through 2036. Boosting hydropower production will ensure  that Americans have access to affordable, clean energy.  As Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers has previously noted on  numerous occasions, only 3 percent of America's 91,000 dams generate  electricity because in part it takes 10 years to get a permit to  develop new hydropower projects.  This bill will help streamline and develop utilizing existing  infrastructure and overcome barriers to future projects.  I urge my colleagues to support the RIVER Act.  Mr. Speaker, I ask a point of personal privilege to address my  esteemed chairman.  Mr. Speaker, I say to my ranking member and my former chairman,  colleague, since I came here 10 years ago, coming from the business  sector nearly 50 years in private practice in the business of  engineering, I have been so impressed with the leadership we have had  in Energy and Commerce. It wasn't what I was expecting. You and Fred,  and even to some extent my friend, Frank, to some extent--Frank, don't  get carried away here.  I have seen you taking on some difficult issues and using humor, your  approach, you have been able to work through some difficult situations  coming up with solutions. So you are going to be missed. You and Mylene  have earned the break. But I think of all the legislation.  You have been in my house. You have come to West Virginia--``West by  God Virginia''--and I do appreciate what you have done for us, what you  have done on the opioid epidemic. It is still ravaging West Virginia  and across this country.  People have to understand that in West Virginia more people are going  to die from opioids than from COVID this year. This is still a problem,  but thanks to you, we are moving in the right direction.  I can't express enough how much you have meant to me in my career and  my confidence. The people's House has been in good hands under you, and  I very much appreciate your service. God bless all of you as you  continue in your retirement.    "
367,Jerry McNerney,1.7915009260177612,D,mcnerney,mcnerney," Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Michigan. I can  tell you a couple minutes is enough time because I am a brief speaker,  but it says a lot that I am willing to come down here and risk COVID to  speak in favor of a Republican. So there you have it.  I have known Greg Walden for many years now in the committee. On  trips [["", Page , H6899, ] and on new legislation, he has been a gentleman, and he has been a  person I could work with.  We have some disagreements, don't we, Greg?  But that says a lot that we can disagree and still be friends.  I went to Oregon to visit and to see the eclipse, and Greg invited me  to go to his place with his friends and watch it with them. I really  appreciated that. So it shows you that people can get along in this  institution, work together, and have respect for each other.  {time} 1745    "

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to "", House Resolution 833, ', the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I rise with enthusiasm and support for  ', H.R. 2474, "", the PRO Act.  I would indicate that in America we would ask the question, When will  we have a 40-hour week or the weekend? All brought about by union  organizing and union leadership.  We need the PRO Act to ensure that Americans across the land have the  ability legally to organize and to be able to operate under the Labor  Management Reporting and Disclosure Act.  Let me also say that it is imperative that we begin to recognize that  the American people like unions. Over 64 percent of Americans and  millennials appreciate the idea of having representation for better  quality of life and work.  So I rise to add to this very important legislation an amendment that  extends whistleblower protections to employees of both employers and  unions under the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act. This is  a fair and balanced amendment. We remember Supreme Court decisions like  the Janus Act, and many others, who undermine the ability for unions to  be able to organize or to engage. This protects the people who are  trying to organize.  But the whistleblower protections allow employees of employers and  employees of unions to be protected if they see something wrong and  they want to make sure that it is right.  Let me give you an example:  Today, I met Kimberly Lawson, who is part of the Fight for $15. She  also came to share the problems she has had with sexual harassment on  the job. It happens to be in one of the fast-food operations. She said,  on the record, that if we could pass the PRO Act, she wouldn't be alone  trying to raise our hourly wage or face sexual harassment without a  union to help her.  This is important legislation. The whistleblower protection is  important because Ms. Lawson would have the ability to be able to  report what is happening to her without losing her job as a single  mother with a young child.  Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    "
369,Gregory Meeks,1.4343359470367432,D,meeks,meeks," Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Espaillat, and I thank the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith). I also thank Representative  Kinzinger for his support and his collaboration in working collectively  to bring this bill to the floor for a vote.  The reason for this bill is actually very simple. Congress must be  clear that Russia cannot be part of the G7 while it does all it can to  undermine democracies, including our own.  What they are doing is inflaming some of the biggest challenges that  face the global community today. Congress has an oversight  responsibility here, and this bill simply makes that clear.  Through its actions, today's Russia continues to prove that it does  not intend to be a part of the global solution. Moscow interferes in  democratic processes across the globe, suppresses and poisons  opposition, and wreaks havoc in emerging nations in Europe--Ukraine and  Georgia being the most recent targets where they still remain, holding  sovereign land.  The list is long. Yet, I am concerned that the President of the  United States has repeatedly expressed his inclination to bring Russia  back to the G7. He has called it commonsense to include Russia. It is  not as long as they continue to behave the way they are.  It is crucial that the American taxpayer should not pay for this  bizarre and harmful courtship of Putin's Russia, the same Russia that  puts bounties on American soldiers in Afghanistan.  Of course, we should have lines of strategic communications open with  Moscow. I am one also open for dialogue. But with Russia's malfeasance,  we cannot welcome them to the table as our partners and allies at a  time when they do not share our democratic values or interests.  There is nothing short of the strength of America's stance as a  global leader at stake. We have to be leaders in bringing folks  together and standing for democracy and for what is good for democracy.  That is who we are as Americans. That is what this United States  Congress stands for.  We must do our oversight in this regard. We must give a message to  Russia that should it want to enter into the G7, it has to play by the  rules and not do undemocratic things or threaten democracy, whether it  is in the United States or any of our European allies.  Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank my colleagues for joining this bill in a  bipartisan effort, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    "
370,Grace Meng,1.0449007749557495,D,meng,meng," Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, as millions across our nation continue to be  impacted by the coronavirus, many continue to live in fear following  the dramatic increase of threats and attacks against those of Asian  descent since the COVID-19 outbreak.  Since January 2020, there has been a significant number of reports of  anti-Asian incidents; wherein, due to scapegoating Asian Americans for  the spread of COVID-19, many are being threatened, harassed, or  assaulted, or have had their businesses vandalized. The upsurge of  racial discrimination against Asian Americans has been fueled by  misinformation about the coronavirus and usage of anti-Asian rhetoric  and terms like ``Chinese virus'' and ``Kung-flu.'' All of our nation's  leaders must stop using these racist phrases that instigate hatred and  violence. In the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, Asian Americans are left  fighting an additional front--that of hate and bigotry.  That is why I introduced a resolution condemning all forms of anti- Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19. We, as leaders of this nation,  must coalesce and condemn all manifestations of expressions of racism,  xenophobia, discrimination, and anti-Asian sentiment and scapegoating.  We must denounce any and all anti-Asian sentiment of any form.  Madam Speaker, during this time of heightened anxiety and fear  surrounding COVID-19, we cannot lose sight of protecting the health and  safety of every single person--no matter their race, ethnicity,  religion, or background. The House must take a strong stand against the  sickening intolerance, bigotry, and violence that is leaving a terrible  stain on our nation's history, especially during this moment of an  unprecedented public health crisis. The adoption of this resolution is  a necessary step to confront the second pandemic of racism and  discrimination in this country. I urge my colleagues to join me in this  effort to keep all Americans safe.    "
371,Dan Meuser,0.04970067739486694,R,meuser,meuser," Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the PIAA on  seeing through a successful fall season for Pennsylvania high school  sports in spite of the many challenges.  We have some great sports teams in my district of Pennsylvania, and I  would like to highlight a few.  North Schuylkill's Spartans won a well-deserved football district  championship at the conclusion of an undefeated season.  Palmyra's high school girls field hockey team won a State title in  overtime, their first in 15 years; Southern Columbia girls soccer won  their second title in 3 years; and Bloomsburg girls soccer won their  State title.  Mr. Speaker, Southern Columbia's high school football program is  nothing short of awesome. Southern Columbia, under Coach Jim Roth, won  their 11th State title. On both sides of the ball, this team dominates,  and the Tigers have made their citizens of Columbia County and all of  Pennsylvania very proud.  And congratulations to Lake Lehman football. I have known many of the  players on this great team since they were 6 years old, playing and  learning the game under Back Mountain Bobcats Head Coach Dan Anderson  and other great coaches.  Lake Lehman's coach, Jerry Gilsky, led the Black Knights to a great  season. They came up short in the district championship game, but they  had a season of champions, and we are proud of them.    "
372,Carol Miller,0.3584381341934204,R,miller,miller," Mrs. MILLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Chuck Yeager. [[', Page , H7243, ]  Mr. Yeager was a war hero, an incredible pilot, and a great West  Virginian.  Born in Lincoln County in the small town of Myra, Chuck was a stellar  athlete and a bright student who enlisted in the Air Force during World  War II, answering the call to serve.  As a pilot, he was known for his outstanding leadership and flying  skills, and his incredible vision. I am also proud to say that he never  lost his steadfast West Virginia spirit.  Flying over 61 missions as an ace, he returned home from the war in  1945. He then became a test pilot who researched high-speed flight.  In 1947, Chuck was the first person to break the sound barrier,  flying over the Mojave Desert, and went on to accomplish more in the  field of flight while serving in the Air Force until 1971.  He was one of America's greatest pilots.  Chuck passed away this month at the age of 97. He lived a life of  adventure, patriotism, service, and strength. He will always be  remembered.    "

Mr. Speaker, I support the legislation finishing the appropriations  process for 2021 because it funds important priorities for Michigan  families. It includes funding for the construction of a new lock at the  Soo Locks, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, rural broadband  internet access, and NIH research into cures for cancer and  Alzheimer's.  Of course, there is more work to do.  Many communities have been affected by disasters this year, including  my district, where two dams failed and communities were flooded.  Congress should do more to help all communities affected by natural  disasters this year, and I will be doing everything I can to help those  in my district apply to receive Federal assistance.  I am glad we have this bill done for the American people, and I look  forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle to craft  bipartisan legislation again in the new year.    "
375,Alex Mooney,0.07952108979225159,R,mooney,mooney," Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, there are good parts of  this bill, the things President Trump asked for at the very beginning,  like tax relief for employers, help for those who lost their jobs, and  funding for the medical community and first responders. I thank  President Trump for his excellent leadership.  I had a couple of ideas I would have liked to offer as amendments to  this bill, but this is a closed process. 435 Members of Congress can't  even offer amendments. That is not the way we are supposed to make  legislation, especially when it spends $2 trillion. [["", Page , H1842, ]  There are parts of this bill that are unrelated to the coronavirus:  $1 billion for Amtrak, money for National Public Radio and the arts.  But what we are not talking about is how we are going to pay for  this. We all agree about spending $2 trillion, but how are we going to  pay for it? Are we going to borrow from China? Are we going to borrow  it from Russia? Are we going to just print the money and devalue our  current currency? That is not being talked about.  The interest on the national debt every year is already about half a  trillion dollars, every year, going forward. We could use that money to  pay for epidemics like this and fund our troops.  So, going forward, we need to talk about balancing our budget and  paying for things.    "
376,Gwen Moore,0.5890492796897888,D,moore,moore," Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of the ALS  Disability Insurance Access Act. This important bill eliminates the  mandatory five-month waiting period for patients with ALS seeking to  access the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits they  earned.  The waiting period creates an undue financial burden when ALS  patients are already facing enormous financial stress. But while we act  today to alleviate the hardship created by this waiting period for ALS  patients, Congress must extend similar relief to other beneficiaries  who are equally deserving.  What sense does it make to have require SSDI beneficiaries to endure  a five-month waiting period after they have been determined eligible  for their earned SSDI benefits? This requirement creates an unnecessary  delay for some of our nation's most vulnerable.  We must ensure that all individuals who qualify for SSDI can access  the benefits for which they have already qualified without undue delay.  I urge my colleagues to not only support the ALS Disability Insurance  Access Act, but to end the waiting period for all SSDI beneficiaries.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, "", S. 578, '.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "

378,Seth Moulton,0.6349627375602722,D,moulton,moulton," Mr. MOULTON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut  (Mr. Larson), my friend, for yielding.  In 2014, Pete Frates told ESPN: ``At the end of the day, I want to be  the cliche game-changer. I want to be the guy who shifts everyone's  thinking and shifts where the funds are going. Selfishly, I want to  give myself a chance, but also give a lot of other people opportunities  as well.''  Today, we consider ourselves incredibly lucky because we got to know  Pete Frates.  Pete, you accomplished this mission long ago, but today's vote is  further proof that you will live forever. We are here because you were  brave enough to stand up and show the world your strength. We are here  because of your family, who continued the fight: Julie, Lucy, John,  Nancy, Jennifer, and Andrew, and the Frate-train. I am so proud of all  of you.  We are here because of the hard work of the ALS Association, I AM  ALS, and because thousands of ALS patients and their families and  caregivers followed your lead.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to pass the ALS Disability  Insurance Access Act, and let's keep fighting until we have a cure for  this devastating disease.    "
379,Debbie Mucarsel-Powell,0.8082436919212341,D,mucarsel-powell,mucarsel-powell," Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my  amendment to the Strength in Diversity Act, and I am very grateful to  Representative Fudge for allowing me to introduce this amendment, a  critical piece of legislation to begin reversing decades of  resegregation in our schools.  In Florida, nearly 63 percent of students are from minority  communities, compared to only 30 percent of teachers. This disparity is  exacerbating racial and socioeconomic achievement gaps.  A teacher in my district, Sharon Rivers, emphasized the importance of  diversity in the classroom, saying: ``Culture diversity in the  classroom is essential in helping us recognize, respect, and welcome  the many differences across the district. It is imperative that we  allow our understanding of our differences to build a bridge of respect  for one another.''  I couldn't agree more, and my amendment would build upon that effort  by increasing the diversity of our teaching workforce. Teachers of  color can provide more culturally relevant education and better  understand the situations their students of color are facing, helping  develop stronger student-teacher relationships.  Our teachers should reflect our communities and our schools. Recent  studies show that increased teacher diversity results in better  achievement scores, lower levels of disciplinary action, and reduced  dropout rates. In fact, a Florida study showed that Black students had  higher reading and math scores when taught by Black teachers.  Unfortunately, in most States, as the proportion of students of color  grows, the number of minority teachers is not keeping pace. We must do  more to ensure that all students, regardless of their race or  background, are set up for success.  I urge everyone to vote to pass my amendment.    "
380,Markwayne Mullin,0.1708884835243225,R,mullin,mullin," Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of ', H.R. 5541, "", the  Tribal Power Act.  As the only Native American that serves on the Energy and Commerce  Committee and one who has lived in Indian Country my entire life, this  bill is extremely important to Tribes. It can strategically help us  receive capital that we need to become energy efficient and enhance our  energy infrastructure.  I have long been a supporter of the economic benefits American energy  brings to our communities. As sovereign nations, Tribes should have the  ability to choose and deploy this kind of energy and the best kind of  energy that works for them. I am proud to be a colead in this very  important issue.  Now, with the remainder of my time, Mr. Speaker, I would like to take  a second and recognize our good leader and a friend that we are going  to lose here in Chairman Walden.  Our committee is better because of your leadership. Anybody who can  put up with my attitude and my great personality and still stay calm  and effectively lead our committee, I just want to tell you that shows  a good leader. It shows somebody I would love to follow and someone I  have enjoyed being able to follow.  Since my time in Congress, you have been a friend and a mentor, one  that I can always count on to give the right advice--not necessarily  something I always wanted to hear, but the right advice. And, as I said  before, that is the character of a good leader.  So, for your 22 years of service, and as someone who only got to  serve with you for 8 of those years, it has been a great honor, and you  will be missed.    "
381,Gregory Murphy,0.29319846630096436,R,murphy,murphy," Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am on the floor briefly today to remind  my colleagues to remind their constituents that December 15 is the open  enrollment deadline for healthcare at healthcare.gov. This is  incredibly important because if you are uninsured or you are currently  on an Affordable Care Act plan, if you don't renew or sign up by the  15th, you will be frozen out of the marketplace unless you have what is  called a qualifying event.  As we head back for the weekend, I want to ensure we do everything we  can to make sure there are aren't more people who go into the New Year  without insurance than absolutely necessary. This is especially  important because we have seen a big decline in the number of people  who have insurance in this country since President Trump took office.  Obviously, we made enormous progress after the passage of the  Affordable Care Act. We were able to get the percentage of Americans  without insurance down to around 5 percent. That is really  extraordinary. Yet we have seen that progress reverse. We have seen  more and more people go without insurance since this administration  started to wage what is a pretty consistent, remarkable war on the  Affordable Care Act.  As we speak today, the Trump administration is in court trying to get  the court system--the Federal court system--to strike down the entirety  of the Affordable Care Act. If they are successful in that endeavor,  then next year's deadline will not matter because the Affordable Care  Act will be gone; 20 million people will lose their health insurance;  insurers will once again be able to charge you more because you have a  preexisting condition or your kid has cancer or you are a woman.  As we fight that court case, we need to remember that the Affordable  Care Act is still out there and is still very affordable for millions  and millions of Americans. Seventy percent of enrollees who go on to  healthcare.gov find they qualify for financial help, meaning the  sticker price is not actually what you pay. The tax credits in  ObamaCare will help you get that premium lower.  In fact, on average, folks are getting pretty sizable premiums--in  the neighborhood of $500. That could make healthcare incredibly  affordable, even if the sticker price looks out of your range.  A woman in Hartford, named Deborah, visited a local enrollment fair  after receiving a letter saying her premiums actually might be going  up. She said this:  That scared me a little bit so I wanted to come in and have   someone explain it to me whether it was going to go up,   decrease, you know, what were my options. What ended up   happening is that actually my premium went down for the same   plan but I also learned that just because they renew you that   I had the opportunity to go in and say no, I don't want that   plan, I want to choose this plan. I am ecstatic with my new   plan. . . . I got educated on the insurance process and I   like that.  You can still get that help. You can still get somebody on the phone  to walk you through your choices. I really encourage people to do that  by this Sunday.  For folks who do find an affordable plan, I hope you will also step  up and try to help us maintain the protections and the coverages we  have. We have been fighting a battle with the Trump administration. It  doesn't like the Affordable Care Act simply because the President's  name is on it, despite the fact that Americans don't want the  Affordable Care Act repealed. But the administration has been doing  everything within its power to try to make it harder for people to sign  up. The administration has rolled back the advertising for the  Affordable Care Act.  This is what qualifies for advertising today--charts on the floor of  the U.S. Senate. The administration has rolled back the money for the  navigators--the people who help you pick which plan is right for you.  The administration, for a period of time, threatened to stop paying  insurance companies, which chilled the interest of insurers to actually  offer plans on these exchanges. As I mentioned, the administration is  going to court to try to unroll and unwind the entirety of the act  through a court case.  Lastly, though, what you will find, if you go and enroll in some  States, are plans that look like an Affordable Care Act plan on these  websites but actually aren't. They are what we call junk plans, short- term plans--plans that don't really cover anything. They might not  cover maternity care or addiction care or mental health or prescription  drugs. Some of these junk plans don't cover you if you get admitted  into the hospital on a Friday or Saturday.  Be careful of those plans because the sticker price is going to look  really low, but that is for a reason. It is because they don't cover  anything.  The President has allowed for those junk plans to be shown right next  to [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7015"">Page S7015</a>, ] the Affordable Care Act plan. Make sure you are signing up for a  regulated, Affordable Care Act plan. That is a plan that is bronze or  silver or gold, not one of these junk short-term plans that is not  going to be right for the vast majority of Americans.  It is not too late. Sunday is the deadline. If you are in  Connecticut, make sure to go to Access Health CT or your State  exchange, if your State runs an exchange. If not, you can get  healthcare through ', <a &#x27;="""" href=""'http://www.healthcare.gov."">www.healthcare.gov. </a>, "" I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    "
382,Gregory Murphy,0.29319846630096436,R,murphy,murphy," Mrs. MURPHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Butch Lewis Act.  Passage of this bill is vital to millions of Americans who have  worked hard and played by the rules. That includes tens of thousands of  workers and retirees who live in Florida and hundreds of workers and  retirees who reside in my Orlando area district.  I want to highlight section 4(h) of the bill, which was added at my  request between committee markup and floor consideration. This  provision requires the Pension Rehabilitation Administration to provide  an annual report to Congress on pension plans that have received a loan  under this bill and that are at risk of failing to repay interest or  principal on that loan. Such a failure would require Federal taxpayers  to absorb the cost of the loan.  This provision to increase congressional oversight will maximize the  number of plans that repay their loans and minimize the financial  burden on Federal taxpayers.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Neal for working with me to  make this important change, and I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.    "
383,Gregory Murphy,0.29319846630096436,R,murphy,murphy," Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to  address the crippling cost of student debt.  Although my Democratic colleagues and I agree substantially on the  issue, we disagree substantially on the solution. We need to cure the  disease, not just put a Band-Aid on it.  Absolving student debt or making college free altogether does not  address [[', Page , H7060, ] the problem. It just passes the debt on to people who have responsibly  paid off their student loans, while encouraging the reckless spending  on administrative bloat in higher education.  From 1988 to 2018, the average tuition and fees at public 4-year  institutions tripled and more than doubled at private 4-year  institutions. We have seen an explosion of vice presidents, counselors,  diversity coaches, and all types of administrative staff who have  nothing to do with giving their students a means of finding employment.  Why? Because they can. The money flows freely from the Federal  Government, and they know that--all at the expense of the student.  So rather than climbing walls, lazy rivers, and so-called safe spaces  and then asking for bailouts, universities should be cutting costs and  focusing on educating their students. This frivolous spending has  ruined many young people's futures, and that is how we address the  calamity of student debt.    "
384,Gregory Murphy,0.29319846630096436,R,murphy,murphy," Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the political  status of Puerto Rico, which is home to more than three million  American citizens.  In my home State of Florida, there are now 1.2 million people who  were born in Puerto Rico or who have Puerto Rican roots. That is more  than any other State.  Every month, many Puerto Ricans move to Florida and other States in  search of a brighter future. The island has been through so much--from  the economic crisis, to Hurricane Maria, to the earthquakes, to COVID- 19.  In Florida, we will always welcome these families with open arms, but  I want them to have more opportunities in Puerto Rico. I don't want  them to feel like they have no alternative but to leave their beloved  home.  In my Orlando district, most of my Puerto Rican constituents have  family members and friends still living on the island. Because they  care deeply about Puerto Rico, I care deeply about Puerto Rico.  But every Member of Congress should care about Puerto Rico because  Puerto Ricans are our fellow American citizens. We are part of the same  American family, even though the hard truth is that the United States  hasn't always treated Puerto Rico very well.  Our country now has the chance to do right by Puerto Rico.  That is because on November 3, Puerto Rico held a vote on its  political status. In a referendum, the people of Puerto Rico were asked  the following question: ``Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately  into the Union as a State?'' Yes or no?  Even though Puerto Rico has been a U.S. territory since 1898, and the  island residents have been American citizens since 1917, this was the  first time the people of Puerto Rico were asked this simple and direct  question.  According to the results, over 52 percent of voters, more than  623,000 people, answered ``yes,'' while nearly 48 percent of voters  answered ``no.''  The vote was fair, and the results were clear.  At this point, it is beyond dispute that a majority of the American  citizens living in Puerto Rico want the territory to become a State.  Now, are there people in Puerto Rico who would prefer for the island  to remain a territory or to become a sovereign nation? Absolutely. And  that is completely valid and legitimate.  But when it comes to the political destiny of a place, the views of  the minority cannot trump or take precedence over the views of the  majority. That would turn the concept of democracy on its head. Votes  matter.  And now that the people of Puerto Rico have spoken, the Federal  Government must listen. Whether it is the White House or Congress,  whether it is Democrats or Republicans, we must respect and respond to  this result.  To do otherwise would be immoral or undemocratic, beneath the dignity  of our great Nation.  Let me be crystal clear on two points so there is no  misunderstanding.  First, it is well known that I personally support statehood because I  think it will provide the people of Puerto Rico with democracy and  equality and political power and a better quality of life. They do not  have these things right now and they deserve to have them.  By the way, I am an immigrant and a refugee. I grew up in Virginia  speaking Vietnamese with my parents. One of the main reasons I love  America is because it is a mix of people from different cultures with  different traditions who speak different languages. I reject the notion  that statehood would weaken Puerto Rico's beautiful culture or its  proud traditions or affect the island's use of the Spanish language.  Having said all this, even though I personally favor statehood, it is  not my place to substitute my views for the views of the people of  Puerto Rico.  If they wished to remain a territory or become a nation, I would  honor that wish.  However, the majority of voters have chosen statehood, and so I  intend to respect that choice.  Finally, let me say this: I am a Democrat, but my support for  statehood has nothing to do with any prediction about whether Puerto  Rico would be a blue State or a red State. History teaches us that such  predictions tend to be wrong, and I personally think Puerto Rico would  be a swing State that elects both Democrats and Republicans.  However, I would support statehood for Puerto Rico if it were as  Republican as Wyoming or as Democratic as Vermont. To oppose statehood  because you fear the people will not vote the way you want them to vote  violates the most basic principles of justice and democracy, and I have  zero patience for that.  In the coming weeks, I will work with Puerto Rico's governor-elect,  resident commissioner, and legislative assembly, with the incoming  Biden administration, and with my congressional colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to determine the best path forward.  I cannot promise a particular result, but I can promise I will never  stop fighting for equality for the American citizens of Puerto Rico.    "

389,Jerrold Nadler,3.0171329975128174,D,nadler,nadler," Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have introduced "", H.R. 3884, "", the  ``Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2020,'' or  the ``MORE Act of 2020.''  This long overdue legislation would reverse the failed policy of  criminalizing marijuana on the federal level and would take steps to  address the heavy toll this policy has taken across the country,  particularly on communities of color.  The MORE Act would make three important changes to federal law:  (1) remove marijuana, or cannabis, from the list of federally  controlled substances;  (2) authorize the provision of resources, funded by an excise tax on  marijuana, to address the needs of communities that have been seriously  impacted by the War on Drugs, including increasing the participation of  communities of color in the burgeoning cannabis market; and  (3) provide for the expungement of Federal marijuana convictions and  arrests.  For far too long, we have treated marijuana as a criminal justice  problem instead of as a matter of personal choice and public health.  Whatever one's views are on the use of marijuana for recreational or  medicinal use, the policy of arrests, prosecution, and incarceration at  the Federal level has proven unwise and unjust.  This issue is not new to Congress. There have been many Members who  have introduced bills upon which provisions in this bill are based. For  instance, Representative Barbara Lee has sponsored bills that are the  foundation of key provisions of the MORE Act, and I thank her for her  longstanding leadership on this issue. Representative Earl Blumenauer  has also been an indefatigable advocate and has supported everything we  have done to get to where we are today. I thank him, as well.  Federal action on this issue would follow the growing recognition in  the states that the status quo is unacceptable. Despite the federal  government's continuing criminalization of marijuana, 36 states and the  District of Columbia have legalized medical cannabis. Fifteen states  and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for adult  recreational use.  I have long believed that the criminalization of marijuana has been a  mistake, and the racially disparate enforcement of marijuana laws has  only compounded this mistake, with serious consequences, particularly  for communities of color.  Marijuana is one of the oldest agricultural commodities not grown for  food, and it has [["", Page , H6838, ] been used medicinally all over the world since at least 2700 B.C., but  its criminalization is a relatively recent phenomenon.  The use of marijuana, which most likely originated in Asia, later  spread to Europe, and made its way to the Americas when the Jamestown  settlers brought it with them across the Atlantic. The cannabis plant  has been widely grown in the United States and was used as a component  in fabrics during the middle of the 19th century. During that time  period, cannabis was also widely used as a treatment for a multitude of  ailments, including muscle spasms, headaches, cramps, asthma, and  diabetes.  It was only in the early part of the 20th century that marijuana  began to be criminalized in the United States--mainly because of  misinformation and hysteria, based at least in part on racially-biased  stereotypes connecting marijuana use and people of color, particularly  African-Americans and Latinos. In 1970, when President Nixon announced  the War on Drugs and signed the Controlled Substances Act into law, the  federal government placed marijuana on Schedule I, the most restrictive  schedule that is attached to the most serious criminal penalties,  where--unfairly and unjustifiably--it has remained ever since.  As a consequence of this decision, thousands of individuals-- overwhelmingly people of color--have been subjected, by the federal  government, to unjust prison sentences for marijuana offenses. It is  time for this manifest injustice to end. The MORE Act would remove  marijuana from Schedule I and the Controlled Substances Act altogether,  thereby decriminalizing it at the Federal level.  This is only fair, particularly because the same racial animus  motivating the enactment of marijuana laws also led to racially  disproportionate enforcement of such laws, which has had a substantial,  negative impact on communities of color. In fact, nationwide, the  communities that have been most harmed by marijuana enforcement are  benefitting the least from the legal marijuana marketplace.  The MORE Act would address some of these negative impacts, by  establishing an Opportunity Trust Fund within the Department of  Treasury to fund programs within the Department of Justice and the  Small Business Administration to empower communities of color and those  adversely impacted by the War on Drugs. These programs would provide  services to individuals, including job training, reentry services and  substance use disorder services; provide funds for loans to assist  small businesses that are owned and controlled by socially and  economically disadvantaged individuals; and provide resources for  programs that minimize barriers to marijuana licensing and employment  for individuals adversely impacted by the War on Drugs.  The collateral consequences of a conviction for marijuana  possession--and even sometimes for a mere arrest--can be devastating.  For those saddled with a criminal conviction, it can be difficult or  impossible to vote, to obtain educational loans, to get a job, to  maintain a professional license, to secure housing, to receive  government assistance, or even to adopt a child.  These exclusions create an often-permanent second-class status for  millions of Americans. This is unacceptable and counterproductive,  especially in light of the disproportionate impact that enforcement of  marijuana laws has had on communities of color. The MORE Act recognizes  this injustice and addresses these harmful effects by expunging and  sealing federal convictions and arrests for marijuana offenses.  It is not surprising that over the past two decades, public support  for legalizing marijuana has surged. In the most recent Pew Research  Center poll--which was released at the end of 2019--67 percent of  Americans now back marijuana legalization, up from 62 percent in Pew's  2018 poll. And just this November, there were ballot measures  pertaining to marijuana in several states; they were all approved by  voters. Indeed, the states have led the way--and continue to lead the  way--on marijuana, but our federal laws have not kept pace with the  obvious need for change. We need to catch up because the public  supports reform and because it is the right thing to do.  In my view, applying criminal penalties, with their attendant  collateral consequences for marijuana offenses is unjust and harmful to  our society. The MORE Act comprehensively addresses this injustice, and  I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill today.    "
390,Grace Napolitano,1.3403793573379517,D,napolitano,napolitano," Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of ', S. 1811, "",  the Water Resources Development Act of 2020. Today's vote is on the  bipartisan, bicameral WRDA agreement by House and Senate Committee  leaders. I want to particularly thank Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member  Graves, Subcommittee Ranking Member Westerman and the Members of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for their important work  over the past 2 years on this bill.  The Water Resources Development Act is our legislative commitment to  investing in [["", Page , H6984, ] Corps projects that help to protect our communities from flooding  events, restore our environment and ecosystems, and keep our nation's  competitiveness by investing in our ports and harbors.  The projects considered in this legislation are truly from Sea to  Shining Sea--from the Unalaska (Dutch Harbor) Project in Alaska, to the  Yuba River Ecosystem Restoration in California, the Matagorda Ship  Channel project in Texas, to the New York and New Jersey Anchorages.  Through biennial enactment of WRDA legislation, the Congress has  addressed local, regional, and national needs through authorization of  new Corps projects, studies, and policies that benefit every corner of  the nation. WRDA 2020 is no exception.  I would particularly like to recognize Chairman DeFazio for his  continued efforts to unlock the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund and his  partnership in ensuring that all ports receive the tools they need in  the future.  My region is home to the largest ports in the nation, the Port of Los  Angeles and the Port of Long Beach. These ports handle over 40 percent  of the exports and imports into the United States. Los Angeles and Long  Beach have invested billions of dollars of their own money to upgrade  their infrastructure for the benefit of the entire nation. But the  success of the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are only as strong  as their partnership with the federal government.  As part of this legislation, donor ports like the Ports of Los  Angeles and Long Beach will benefit from a greater share of the Harbor  Maintenance Trust Fund. Expanded in-water uses that are crucial to the  navigation of the federal channel are now eligible. Seismic impacts  will also be considered as part of the benefit-cost ratio for  navigation projects.  I am also proud of the provisions in WRDA that look to study water  supply as a primary purpose of the Corps. We in the West are in a  continuous fight against drought, and we have remarkable Corps  reservoirs that were built for flood control but can be used more  effectively for local water supply. The Corps is adapting to these  local needs in the West, and this bill will give the Corps more ability  and focus on addressing long-term water reliability of arid  communities.  The bill also includes important assistance to socio-economically  disadvantaged urban and rural areas by requiring the Corps to work more  directly with local leaders and residents on Corps projects and provide  positive impacts to these communities. This will build long-term  resiliency for economic development, environmental and health  improvements, and clean and safe water resource projects.  Lastly, this bill includes language necessary for my district and  wildfire prone regions of the country to improve efforts by the Corps  to remove unauthorized, human-made flammable equipment and materials  from Corps property. This year there was an illegal fire on Corps  property in my district that led to a major wildfire evacuating  hundreds of residents and coming close to damaging property and harming  our community. The language in this bill, in addition to efforts to  increase Corps funding, will go a long way to helping the Corps remove  these fire hazards.  I would like to thank the many people who have helped this bill  become a reality: Subcommittee Vice Chair Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, for  her leadership on WRDA and especially all things Florida.  Thank you to the leadership at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ASA  James, General Spellmon, Retired General Semonite, Al Lee and the  Senior Executive Service team, and Corps Counsel. I would especially  like to thank Corps Futures Team--David Wethington, Laura Powell, and  Andrea Busch, for their time and partnership in answering our questions  to the nearly 1,100 submissions we received for WRDA 2020.  I am very fortunate to have some of the best water and port leaders  in the country in my district and Southern California who provided  valuable input for this bill, including Col. Julie Balten, Col. Aaron  Barta and David Van Dorpe of the Los Angeles District, Los Angeles  County Supervisor Hilda Solis, Los Angeles County Public Works Director  Mark Pestrella, Los Angeles City Mayor Eric Garcetti, Los Angeles Port  Director Gene Seroka, Long Beach Port Director Mario Cordero,  Metropolitan Water District Board Chair Gloria Grey, and San Gabriel  Basin Watermaster Tony Zampiello.  Madam Speaker, I would particularly like to thank the Subcommittee  Ranking Member Bruce Westerman for his friendship and collegiality  through the hearings, meetings and roundtables which led to this  bipartisan accomplishment. And most importantly, I would like to thank  the incredible water subcommittee staff, including Alexa Williams,  Camille Touton, Navis Bermudez, Ryan Seiger, Victor Sarmiento, Jon  Pawlow, and Ian Bennitt.  I urge my colleagues to support WRDA 2020.    "
391,Grace Napolitano,1.3403793573379517,D,napolitano,napolitano," Ms. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I was absent during roll call vote No.  104. Had I been present, I would have voted ``YEA'' on concurring in  the Senate Amendment to "", H.R. 266, '--Paycheck Protection Program and  Health Care Enhancement Act.    "
392,Richard Neal,3.4301936626434326,D,neal,neal," Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.  I acknowledge the good efforts of Ranking Member Brady on the energy  front in the tax package, as well. It is a series of compromised  measures. He did a terrific job, I think it is fair to say, on surprise  billing, and not to mention USMCA. Those were very substantial  accomplishments that the Ways and Means Committee led on in the 116th  Congress.  Mr. Brady, as he was closing, mentioned that this measure he did not  want to see treated as stimulus, and he is right; this is not about  stimulus.  This is about stability.  This is about building a bridge for those people who are really  hurting as we turn the page on this year.  This is about those who are wondering how they are going to make the  next rental payment, sustenance for the American family, how they might  repair that automobile that sits in the garage idle because they  couldn't afford it.  That is what this is really about this evening.  I started with Charles Dickens and ``A Christmas Carol'' and the  lessons of Jacob Marley, but let me conclude with a very simple  description in ``The Epic of America.''  When asked what it was that set America apart from the rest of the  world, it was suggested it was a habit of the heart, a kindness and a  decency and a goodness. And let me close the debate on that basis and  urge passage of the CASH Act and $2,000 for the American people.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, "", H.R. 9051, '.  The question was taken.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    "
393,Joe Neguse,3.5085272789001465,D,neguse,neguse," Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Huffman for his  leadership.  I am proud to speak in support of two of my bills being considered  today, ', H.R. 5458, ' and ', H.R. 5459, '. As you have heard, these bipartisan  bills would extend Rocky Mountain National Park and ultimately create  more opportunities for Coloradans and visitors to our State to enjoy  outdoor activities.  ', H.R. 5458, "", the bill before the House right now, the Rocky Mountain  National Park Boundary Modification Act, as has been articulated  previously, would formally codify a generous donation into the park  boundary made by former astronaut and Longmont, Colorado, native, Vance  Brand.  Mr. Brand bravely served our country in the Armed Forces and then  served as an astronaut, and he has now so generously agreed to donate  roughly 40 acres to Rocky Mountain National Park. This expansion would  add additional protections for the park's high elevation ecosystem and  provide recreational access to literally hundreds of miles of trails.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have introduced both of these legislative  proposals, which came at the request of local communities that I have  the honor of representing back in Colorado and that ultimately seek to  protect the public lands that they love. The bills enjoy the support  from the town of Estes Park, Larimer County, and the Rocky Mountain  Conservancy.  As one of the Nation's most historic parks, Rocky Mountain National  Park remains one of the top-visited public lands in our country,  attracting over 4.6 million people, annually, in recent years. Given  the park's breathtaking scenery and iconic significance, these numbers  are only anticipated to rise.  I know my good friend from the Fifth Congressional District of  Colorado, Representative Lamborn, knows Rocky Mountain National Park  well. I am sure, like me, he and his family have had countless  opportunities to enjoy the park and its breathtaking scenery.  It is an honor to be able to represent Rocky Mountain National Park  here in the United States Congress.  People from all over the world are drawn to the park, each for their  own reasons, to experience nature, seek solitude, watch wildlife, and  partake in outstanding recreational activities. I, myself, hold a  number of treasured memories growing up in Colorado and enjoying Rocky  Mountain National Park: hikes with my father and now being able to take  my daughter on those same trails. It is something that holds deep  meaning for many Americans, and especially for Coloradans.  As we collectively seek healing during and after the COVID-19  pandemic, our public lands offer both a mental and physical refuge as  well as an economic stimulus for the local communities that rely on  them.  Additionally--and this bears mentioning--this year, devastating  wildfires have occurred across Colorado, forcing evacuations,  threatening air and water quality, and destroying homes and businesses.  Three of the State's five largest fires in the history of Colorado  occurred in 2020.  While the bulk of these fires were on lands surrounding Rocky  Mountain National Park, nearly 30,000 acres burned within the park's  boundary. When the East Troublesome fire grew over 100,000 acres in 1  day and swept through a portion of the park, a number of park  structures were lost.  Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to thank the  superintendent of the Rocky Mountain National Park and her wonderful  rangers and all of the personnel at Rocky Mountain National Park who  work tirelessly to protect the park and the communities that surround  it.  Given the devastating nature of these wildfires, in addition to the  COVID-19 pandemic, fulfilling the requests of local Colorado  communities that have been impacted by, not one, but two, historic  disasters is an even greater imperative.  Mr. Speaker, for that reason, I respectfully urge my colleagues to  support both "", H.R. 5458, ' and ', H.R. 5459, "", bipartisan bills that will  protect our treasured public lands.    "
394,Dan Newhouse,0.24196013808250427,R,newhouse,newhouse," Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, on behalf of the ranking member, I would  just like to say that we support this legislation. We certainly  appreciate our friend, Mr. Lujan, for bringing it forward.  Just a few comments I would like to make, rising in support of "", H.R. 3682, "". This bill seeks to ensure better consultation and collaboration  between our Federal land management agencies and local stakeholders  over management of New Mexico's land grants and acequias.  "", H.R. 3682, ' requires coordination between the Department of  Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, and land grant-mercedes.  These are the governing bodies of certain community land grants made by  Spain or Mexico in the 17th to the mid-19th centuries to individuals,  groups, and communities to promote the settlement of the southwestern  United States.  Specifically, this bill directs Federal land management agencies to  make these bodies aware of changes to management plans and other  Federal actions affecting their land grants. ', H.R. 3682, "" also requires  the Federal Government to issue guidance on permitting and permissible  uses.  Finally, this bill creates a process for New Mexico's land grant- mercedes to establish their historical boundaries and provides a  pathway for acquiring Federal land that falls within those boundaries  when the Federal Government disposes of it.  We should always strive to make sure that the Federal Government is a  good neighbor to the communities most impacted by its land management  decisions, and this good bill does exactly that. It empowers rural  communities in New Mexico with a greater say over land management  decisions impacting their historically important common lands which  will, in turn, ensure continued community care and use for generations  to come.  So I support this legislation. I thank the gentleman very much for  bringing it forward, and I yield back the balance of my time.    "
395,Donald Norcross,0.2702898383140564,D,norcross,norcross," Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and  certainly for his leadership in bringing this conference report to the  floor for the 60th year. And certainly, I take a moment to thank Mac  Thornberry, who this conference report is named after, for his  leadership, and certainly Mike Rogers. They are the type of Members  that we all should look toward in terms of being bipartisan and working  toward a goal.  Mr. Speaker, this conference report continues the Tactical Air and  Land Forces Subcommittee's long tradition of bipartisanship to make  America's Armed Forces the best in the world. I commend the hard work  of our Members, my colleagues, our staff, certainly in these unusual  and demanding circumstances brought on by the coronavirus.  I also thank Ranking Member Hartzler for her leadership and  commitment to working toward a goal of keeping America safe. Our  cooperation has kept us focused on what is truly important. We have  delivered a defense bill that meets the modernization and readiness  needs of our Nation's air and land forces.  This bill carefully manages our military resources while increasing  the Department of Defense program oversight to make sure that we do our  job, particularly in the F-35, our most advanced weapons system and  also the most expensive in U.S. history.  But we are also looking at manned and unmanned intelligence,  surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, and continued oversight of  the Army's new modernization strategy with respect to Army aviation,  including the CH-47 Chinook helicopter.  Also, I take a moment for our national defense and the priorities of  keeping America safe and New Jersey safe while ensuring the KC-10  refuelers are not retired prematurely and making sure the KC-46s are  being delivered on time.  I am grateful this bill includes that 3 percent pay raise, taking  care of military families and also providing affordable childcare on  bases. Making sure that your children are safe is incredibly important.  I am proud of the hard work this committee has done to continue to  serve America's national security interests.  Mr. Speaker, this bill deserves our support, and I urge a ``yes''  vote.    "
396,Ralph Norman,0.3664720952510834,R,norman,norman," Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to come before you today to  celebrate National Bible Week. What better time to celebrate Bible Week  in what is called the people's House, but what is ultimately God's  house.  In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a national  proclamation to celebrate the impact of the Bible on our Nation, a  light for so many and a source of hope in the darkest of times.  The boundless influence of the Holy Bible on this Nation is  unmistakable.  In this Chamber, Moses, the messenger of the Ten Commandments, a  witness of God in all of his glory upon the mountaintop, watches over  this body from above the gallery doors each time we gather to conduct  business.  However, it is not merely the multitudes of honorary monuments and  portraits of Biblical figures and passages that exemplify the  importance of the Scriptures to all Americans, but it is the impression  on our social fabric that is so evident in our actions, which speaks  volumes.  This Nation was founded upon Judeo-Christian principles. A stroll  past any of the extraordinary monuments here in the Capitol makes that  abundantly evident. Our commitment to the fundamentals of the Word of  the Lord Jesus has sustained us throughout our rich history, during the  highest of times and during the lowest of times.  The profound impact of the Bible, and particularly the Gospels, led  me to serve in this great body. It is the words of the Son of God, to  ``love each other as I have loved you,'' which guides me. And I believe  that if we continue to turn to the Lord in all that we do, our best is  yet to come.  Despite our fierce philosophical differences and the imperfect nature  of legislation, God never fails us. An annual celebration of His  infallible Word and never-ending love, though not near enough, is the  perfect reminder for us to unite as a body with the shared goal of  humbly serving our creator faithfully and encouraging this Nation to do  the same.  God bless each and every one of you.    "

399,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,0.20874285697937012,D,ocasio-cortez,ocasio-cortez," Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address what is top  of mind to Americans across the country, and that is the extraordinary  economic and health hardship of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout this  year.  The reason I decided to rise today is because we are here convening  in Washington, and just a day or two ago, the Senate majority leader,  Senator McConnell, decided to break the Senate.  He broke the Senate as there are thousands of people in Texas lined  up for food lines. He broke the Senate while hospitals no longer have  beds to house the sick. He broke the Senate and dismissed the Senate  while 30 million Americans are on the brink of eviction.  He dismissed the Senate when every single day when we go back to our  communities, people are asking us: Is there going to be help? Is there  going to be a second stimulus check? Are we going to get the resources  that we need?  He broke the Senate. And in breaking the Senate, we are abandoning  our people.  Thanksgiving is around the corner, and there are millions of  Americans that won't be able to afford a meal to eat, that don't know  if they will be kicked out of their home, that are unsure if they are  going to have to quit their job to care for their child. And we are  having entire bodies, and the Senate prides itself as one of the most  deliberative bodies, they abandoned them.  The number of Americans living in poverty since May has grown by 8  million people, since just May 2020. According to a study from Columbia  University, this rise in poverty has been concentrated in Black and  Latino children and people.  The CARES Act stimulus checks and unemployment benefits lifted more  than 18 million individuals in the United States out of monthly poverty  in April alone. But this number fell from 18 million to 4 million  individuals in August and September after unemployment benefits were  expired.  Just 44 percent of people in the United States are very confident  that they can afford the needed food that will be necessary for the  next 4 weeks. That means the majority of people in the United States  are not very confident in their ability to eat over the next 4 weeks,  according to a new Census survey data. About 10 percent, or 3.5 million  households, are not at all confident in their ability to eat the week  before Thanksgiving, and the Senate broke. It is unconscionable,  unconscionable leadership to abandon our people.  {time} 1230  And while we are arguing about negotiations, and while we are arguing  about points, people are going hungry. And we are dismissing their  needs as blue State needs or as bailouts depending on what party you  voted for. Hunger has no party. Illness has no party. And when we allow  suffering to be alleviated or concentrated based on political  affiliation, we are doing a disservice to our entire Nation.  This uncertainty in food reflects food hardship across the country,  with 5.6 million households with children struggling to put enough food  on the table in the last 7 days.  Landlords filed at least 43,500 evictions in 17 major cities from  March until September. An estimated 13.4 million adults living in  rental housing today--nearly one-in-five renters--were not caught up on  rent.  Small businesses don't know if they are going to survive or exist in  a month, in a week, in January.  We cannot afford to wait for a new administration or another  election, or a political state of play. We need to get people help now,  and the Senate broke. They broke.  We are supposed to be here to work for everyday people. We are not  supposed to be here to work for political donors or political favors or  the powerful. We are here to serve the people who are most vulnerable,  all the way up to the top. But we start with the people most in need.  Our country is going hungry on the week before Thanksgiving, and the  Senate broke. I don't care what party you are. It is an abandonment of  our responsibilities as elected officials who are charged with acting  in the public trust.  The unemployment rate jumped in April to a level not seen since the  1930s and still stood at 6.9 percent in October. Some 10.8 percent of  Black workers and 8.8 percent of Latino workers were unemployed in  October compared to 6 percent of White workers. Last week, 1.1 million  Americans filed new unemployment claims. Today, 4.4 million Americans  are receiving pandemic emergency unemployment compensation, up from 1.4  million in August.  Last week was the 35th straight week total initial claims were  greater than the worst week of the Great Recession, and the Senate  broke.  You know, I want to address some of the claims, because yesterday I  said that we need to make sure that people get economic relief due to  these shutdowns. And I was surprised to hear so many Republicans now  concerned about how we are going to pay for it or using other people's  money. But the Senate majority leader wasn't concerned about other  people's money when he authorized a $4 trillion leveraged bailout for  Wall Street in March. He wasn't concerned about where that money came  from. He wasn't concerned about how we were going to pay for that.  It is only when we are talking about relief for working people, for  children, for families, for parents, for education, for healthcare  that, all of a sudden, we can't pay for any of these things. But when  it comes to tax subsidies for private jets, we have got the money for  that. When it comes to the endless appropriation towards more and more  military spending, when we aren't even, technically, in growing  elements of war, according to some people, we have money for that. But  we don't have money to feed our own kids. We don't have money to  educate people. We don't have money to provide healthcare.  But we have money for private jets. We have money for tax loopholes  for yachts. We have money to incentivize stock buybacks. We have a  billion dollars to invest in research and development for a vaccine-- which was proudly invested in and a good use of public funds--just for  pharmaceutical companies to take these publicly developed drugs and  then sell them back to the public at no discount, so we don't even get  a return on this investment. How is that fiscally responsible?  So we are living in a world and a state of play in our governance  where the party who is eager to help subsidize private jets somehow  can't find the dollars and the cents to get people a $1,200 check. It  is unconscionable, and it is wrong. And the Senate broke.  I am rising today, because it is extraordinarily difficult to  represent a [["", Page , H6010, ] working-class district, not a private jet district, and go home every  week, just as I am about to do again, and feel as helpless in this body  because the majority of its Members and the majority of the Senate  can't seem to get it together and get people the help that we need. And  the Senate broke.  This is what I have to do. This is what we are resorting to, speaking  to an empty room because the Senate broke.  So if there is anything that I have left to say, if there is anybody  out there that is listening, if you are a working family, if you are  struggling to get the food that you need, if you feel like you are on  the brink of eviction, we see you. We see you.  What I ask of the Senate and what I ask of our Republican colleagues  in the Senate is to act as if you were the one that was going hungry.  Act as if it is you getting evicted from your house. Act with that  urgency.  That is all I have to say.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
400,Pete Olson,0.6535427570343018,R,olson,olson," Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to do something Texans love to  do: to brag about my home State. I am going to brag about two Texas-22  volleyball teams that made the Texas finals this past weekend.  The Fulshear Chargers have played 4 short years of high school  volleyball. It took them only 3 years to win the State title in class  4-A. That was last year. This year, they moved up to class 5-A. A  downgrade? No. They went to the 5-A State finals, losing to undefeated  Lovejoy.  In 6-A, the Seven Lakes Spartans were amazing. Despite having half  the team down with COVID and not being able to practice for 2\\1/2\\  weeks, they won the 6-A championship, the first team ever in the 101- year history of the Katy Independent School District to win the State  title.  Madam Speaker, 1 million neighbors in Texas-22 and Santa Clause  congratulate and are darn proud of our Spartans and our Chargers. They  have proved once and for all: Don't mess with Texas-22 volleyball  teams.  Ho, ho, ho. [["", Page , H7264, ]      "
401,Ilhan Omar,0.3280244767665863,D,omar,omar," Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I am here not only to defend my friend and  colleague, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; I am here on behalf of women  around the world. This is not just about one woman, one incident, or  one verbal assaulter. This is about respect and fundamental equality.  Like Alexandria, I was raised by a dignified man who told me that I  deserved equality because I was an equal human being to my brothers. I  am appalled often, like Alex was, when we hear men say: I would never  do this because I have a wife, I have a daughter, I have sisters.  Madam Speaker, you don't only respect women because they could be  your mother, they could be your wife, and they could be your sister.  No. You respect women because they are equal human beings to you. That  is how my father raised me, and that is how Alexandria's father raised  her.  Nearly every woman in the world has experienced verbal abuse, not  just once, but since they were little girls. We experience it on  playgrounds; we experience it in workplaces; and we experience it in  our social media feeds. We see it coming regularly from the President  of the United States, and now we see it coming from his partisan  lackeys. From birth, little girls are sent the message that they don't  matter.  In this body, we have seen men who are afraid of Muslim women like me  and Rashida Tlaib because we say proudly that you cannot ban us from  this country because we pray differently than you. They are afraid of  women everywhere fighting systems of repression and sexual harassment  through the Me Too movement. They are afraid not just of us but of  losing their own power.  It is no accident that Alex was verbally abused for speaking up for  poverty in her district and its relation to unrest because when you  push power, power pushes back. When we speak for people from  marginalized communities, we understand, as people who come from those  marginalized communities, that is a threat to those who wield power  against marginalized communities.  So, we are here to say that we will not allow sexism, misogyny, and  patriarchy to hold us back. We will not apologize for advocating for  women everywhere. We will not apologize for claiming the power that  women deserved for centuries. And we will send a message to our  daughters and their daughters that they deserve fundamental equality.    "
402,Steven Palazzo,0.029820406809449196,R,palazzo,palazzo," Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the outstanding  career of service of Mr. Cannie Lee Cody.  Mr. Cody hails from Jacksonville, Florida, and volunteered at 18  years old to serve his country in the United States Coast Guard.  After a few years, he decided to follow the path to become a  detective. At the age of 29, Mr. Cody graduated as valedictorian from  the Duval County Patrol Academy. He served as a highway patrolman for 5  years, eventually reaching the rank of detective sergeant at the Duval  County Sheriff's Office.  In the 1960s, riots began to break out in Jacksonville, Florida. One  riot occurred on March 23, 1964, and on that evening, Mrs. Johnnie Mae  Chappell, a mother of 10, was shot and killed. Mrs. Chappell had  returned home by bus and then walked to a local store. Upon arriving  home, she realized she had left her wallet and went to look for it  along the highway.  According to witnesses, a dark sedan slowed down and a shot was fired  from the vehicle, which killed Mrs. Chappell. The case was left open  and unsolved.  Five months later, Mr. Cody and his partner encountered a young man  who they suspected was involved in the murder. This encounter led them  to three other assailants who also confessed to Mrs. Chappell's murder.  By this time, they had tracked down the murder weapon and enough  evidence to close the case. They gave the uncovered information to the  chief of police, but sadly, they were removed from the case and lost  their jobs a year later.  Mr. Cody had spent the following decades trying to get justice for  Mrs. Chappell and her family. For years, he sought vindication and to  expose the corruption of the officials involved.  Mr. Cody went on to write a book called ``The 14th Denial: A Civil  Rights Memoir,'' which inspired the movie ``Wanted Justice: Johnnie Mae  Chappell.'' Both the book and movie are thought-provoking and share an  incredibly important story.  For his service, Mr. Cody is being honored by the Department of  Veterans Affairs for his dedication to our country and the civil rights  movement.  Mr. Cody has spent his life fighting for what is right and serving  others. It is an honor to recognize the heroic career of service of Mr.  Cannie Lee Cody.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
403,Frank Pallone,4.582678318023682,D,pallone,pallone," Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  I rise in strong support of this final omnibus package that includes  critical legislation from the Energy and Commerce Committee.  First, this agreement includes $69 billion to crush the coronavirus  by supporting the rapid and equitable distribution of COVID-19  vaccines, as well as critical testing and contact tracing.  Second, this package finally ends surprise medical bills for American  consumers. These surprise bills have burdened millions of patients with  crushing medical debts. It saves money, which pays for a 3-year  extension to fund community health centers and other vital healthcare  programs.  Third, the bill phases down HFCs. This is a big win in the fight  against climate change, along with the reauthorization of the Pipeline  Safety Act, which reduces methane leaks.  And, fourth, we provide major assistance for struggling families to  better afford their internet service.  These are just a few of the key provisions from the Energy and  Commerce Committee.  But I want to end by thanking the chair, Nita Lowey. As she  mentioned, she and Eliot Engel, myself, and Rich Neal are the last in  our class. I hate to say it that way. She has been an outstanding  legislator and a great friend. My only regret is that she is going to  just leave Richie Neal and myself to carry on here. So I really wish  she would not leave, but I know she wants to, and I wish her the best.  I love you, Nita.    "
404,Gary Palmer,1.0869542360305786,R,palmer,palmer," Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) for hosting this special hour to talk about the  Bible.  Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 419th anniversary of the King James  Version of the Bible. [["", Page , H7099, ]  In 1604, King James I commissioned 54 scholars from Oxford and  Cambridge Universities to produce one uniform translation of the Bible  that all denominations could accept. It is unlikely that there has ever  been another group of translators whose collective expertise in  Biblical languages was equal to this group.  Benson Bobrick, who wrote a book called ``Wide as the Waters,'' said,  because of the people's desire to read the Bible, the English  translation, known as the Authorized Version in Great Britain, helped  Great Britain become the most literate nation in the world. In terms of  the language of the King James Version, about 90 percent are Anglo- Saxon words with a vocabulary of only about 8,000 words for the entire  translation. It was the first major work of English prose based  primarily on Anglo-Saxon words instead of Latin.  The King James translation established the prose style for English  and American literature and became the foundation of modern English  language giving us words and phrases that are common parts of our  language today.  In his ``History of England,'' Thomas Macaulay said that `` . . . if  everything else in our language should perish, it would alone suffice  to show the whole extent of its beauty and power.''  Bobrick wrote: ``Its subsequent impact on English, and American,  literature might be traced in a thousand ways--in the work of religious  writers like Milton and Bunyan, or their more secular brethren like  D.H. Lawrence, Walt Whitman, and Defoe. Without the King James Version,  it has been said, `there would be no `Paradise Lost,' no `Pilgrim's  Progress' . . . no Gettysburg Address.' ''  As Britain's literacy rate increased, it fostered a spirit of inquiry  which led to people reading books and tracts that transformed the laws  and government of Great Britain and ultimately laid the foundation for  American political thought, and our Founders' ideas about individual  liberty and constitutional government.  Including the 1611 edition, there were four other editions of the  King James Bible, which were published in 1629, 1638, 1762, and 1769;  the last is the version that is most commonly cited today.  ``Next to the Bible itself,'' Bobrick wrote, ``the English Bible was,  and is, the most influential book ever published.''  According to Vanderbilt University Press, the King James Version is  the best-selling book of all time, with more than 5 billion copies  sold, and it is the most frequently quoted book ever written.  Russell Kirk concluded that it was the book that was to exert a  stronger influence than any other in America. He wrote: ``Read from  American pulpits and in the great majority of American households  during colonial times, the Authorized Version shaped the style,  informed the intellect, affected the laws, and decreed the morals of  the North American colonies.''  P. Marion Simms wrote: ``No nation in all history was ever founded by  people so dominated by the Bible as America.'' In fact, every American  President except Franklin Pierce has been sworn in with their hands  placed on the English Bible.  Even though it was published after the Jamestown Colony was  established, the King James Bible was the book that had the greatest  impact on the American culture.  ``The English did not really drive away the American colonists, nor  were they driven,'' said G.K. Chesterton. ``The Americans were led on  by a light that went before.''  The light was the Biblical light that the English Bible had given  them: the idea of the equality of man. It was the idea of the sacred  and equal importance of every man, as made in the image and likeness of  God.  One of the earliest copies of the King James Version Bible can be  seen at the Museum of the Bible. I encourage everyone to visit this  great American museum.  Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, Mr. Lamborn, for this great opportunity.    "
405,Jimmy Panetta,1.1255313158035278,D,panetta,panetta," Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the COVID temporary [["", Page , H7294, ] relief package in this rule. We did it before. We must do it again.  Our past COVID legislation kept the economy afloat and our poverty  rate flat. However, as Democrats passed more bills, the Senate and the  President put a pause on those efforts.  Now, the pandemic is raging, hospitals are bursting, and our economy  is hurting. That is why we must play our part with Federal funding to  combat this disease and carry on through the locally mandated  shutdowns.  This relief package will allow us to avoid calamity and aid our  recovery by providing small businesses with PPP, laid-off employees  with unemployment insurance, families with checks, farmworkers with  PPE, renters with direct relief, and the ailing with the HOSPICE Act.  To help State and local governments, there is funding for broadband,  food, healthcare, education, and transportation.  Look, this package should have been bigger. It should have been done  quicker. It is not entirely what we want. But it is what we need to be  that bridge to a vaccine-fueled revival in 2021. If we do that, we will  further the faith in what we do here in Congress for the future of our  democracy.    "
406,Chris Pappas,1.0586532354354858,D,pappas,pappas," Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano for getting this  important legislation to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of "", H.R. 7105, "", a crucial piece of  veterans legislation that aptly bears the name of our distinguished  ranking member, Dr. Roe.  The bill now includes three pieces of legislation that I introduced  to ensure VA is able to fulfill its mission of supporting all those who  have borne the battle. These three provisions will help improve the  quality of care and address deficiencies that frustrate and even harm  our veterans.  The first requires VA to address bureaucratic waste, fraud, abuse,  and mismanagement identified by the Government Accountability Office's  High Risk List.  A second provisions honors the sacrifices of our female veterans by  ensuring they have access to properly fitted prosthetic items, just as  their male counterparts do.  The third focuses on punitive debt collection practices by VA against  our veterans, many of whom have done everything right. This provision  sets limits on when VA may initiate collection proceedings and even  gives our veterans the ability to update crucial benefit information  online.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the House and Senate committees for getting this  bipartisan bill to the floor, and I urge my colleagues to pass this  legislation today.  Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington), who served on the Veterans'  Affairs Committee and the Ways and Means Committee. He has been a  tireless advocate for veterans during that time.  Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, there would not be a Texas if it  were not for Tennessee.    "
407,Bill Pascrell,1.7472840547561646,D,pascrell,pascrell," Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the chairman. I know he has  worked hard on this for many moons, and he deserves it. He earned it.  Mr. Speaker, 64 years ago this week, Dwight Eisenhower signed into  law the Interstate Highway System. The roads, the bridges, the highways  of that system connected Americans and communities together like never  before. It is no stretch that the landmark legislation remade the  United States for a new postwar era, a great measure for the homeland's  security. That is how he put it.  Today, we are implementing the aspirations in the Green New Deal by  passing our own blueprint for the next century. It includes bridges,  roads, new trains, buses, new water pipelines in housing. This plan  invests in electric, solar, water, geothermal, and wind power.  It includes my own Offshore Wind Power bill that will create clean  energy jobs and invest in renewable sources of energy, because the  future can't just be bold and big; it must be clean, too.  "", H.R. 2, "" is a down payment on an America for our children and our  grandchildren because a living, breathing great Nation invests in its  future. Today, we are doing exactly that.  Mr. Speaker, I have been here for 25 years. We have always had 5-year  plans for infrastructure, and we are back maybe to normality now,  thanks in great part to our chairman.    "
408,Donald Payne,1.101915717124939,D,payne,payne," Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss my bill, the Removing Barriers  to Colorectal Cancer Screening Act. It has been a long time coming.  I thank my friend and New Jersey colleague, Congressman Frank  Pallone, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. As chairman  of the House committee, his leadership was critical to getting my bill  to the floor today.  I have been working on this bill since my arrival to the United  States House of Representatives. Unfortunately, colorectal cancer is  the reason that I am a member of this body.  In addition, I thank my coleads on the bill, as you heard earlier,  Congressman Rodney Davis and my colleague from Virginia, Donald  McEachin, who has been instrumental in moving this bill forward.  Congressman McEachin has done an incredible amount of work to promote  the bill and increase awareness of colorectal cancer. I also thank my  other colead, Congressman David McKinley from West Virginia, for his  efforts, as well.  These great representatives understand the importance of this bill to  the health and security of millions of Americans and know that  colorectal cancer is bipartisan in nature of its negative impact on  people in this country.  Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in  America. It only trails lung cancer, and it affects both men and women.  It is the second leading cause of death in the United States in  cancers.  Like many cancers, it is treatable and patients can recover if it is  caught early enough. But that depends on whether Americans get  screened. And one of the reasons that we are here today, my bill would  seek to remove one of the barriers to screenings. It would allow  Medicare to cover screenings and surgical procedures to remove  cancerous polyps during the screenings.  Today, Medicare covers only screenings for eligible patients. If  doctors find and remove a cancerous polyp during the screening,  patients could wake up to a surprise bill that could cost thousands of  dollars.  After my father succumbed to this dreadful disease, I had my first  colonoscopy, and at that time they found 13 polyps. So can you imagine  the bill that I could have potentially awoken to, tens of thousands of  dollars in bills that I did not even know that I had?  Too many men refuse to get screened because of the fear of this  surprise bill and a lot of the reason why men don't find this procedure  very palatable. Then they wait to get screened until there is a  problem, and potentially that is a decision that could be fatal.  I encourage my House colleagues to vote for this bill so we can save  thousands of American lives annually.  It has been almost 9 years since I lost my father, Congressman Donald  Payne, Sr., to colorectal cancer, and I do not want to see other  families go through the same horror and pain.  I ask that we pass this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes''  and save the lives of the American people.    "
409,Nancy Pelosi,0.057771436870098114,D,pelosi,pelosi," Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I  thank him for his masterful work in not only bringing this legislation  to the floor but working in a bipartisan [["", Page , H9159, ] way to have so many important initiatives in the COVID and the omnibus  bill that the President happily, for us, signed last evening. I thank  him for his initiatives that are job-creating, that stimulate the  economy and help meet the needs of the American people.  Madam Speaker, I am interested in the comments made by Mr. Brady  because he said we could be putting more money into small business, and  we do indeed in the COVID package, around $300 billion. I think it is  important to note, Madam Speaker, that that brings it to almost about a  trillion dollars since March 27 or 28, when the President signed the  CARES Act, about $950 billion for small business, nearly a trillion  dollars. Very important.  Small business is the heart of our economy. What could be more  optimistic for anyone to do but to follow their dreams, start a small  business, create jobs, create wealth, create capital. It is so  important. We see the importance of that to the tune of about a  trillion dollars, just under a trillion dollars, in these past several  months.  Madam Speaker, if you want to talk about job creation, I hope the  gentleman will join us when we go forward to do State and local, our  healthcare workers, honoring our heroes. They are at risk of losing  their jobs. While they risk their lives to save lives, they may lose  their jobs, and over a million of them have.  We are talking about healthcare workers. We are talking about police  and fire, our first responders. We are talking about transportation,  sanitation, food workers. We are talking about our teachers, our  teachers, our teachers, the custodians of our children for a large part  of their day.  They are at risk of losing their jobs because of the failure of the  Republican side of the aisle to support funds for State and local  government to honor our heroes. We want to honor them. While we cheer  them, we applaud them, let's give them pay, and let's let them have job  security. Let's give them PPE, the equipment that they need to do their  job.  If we want to talk about saving jobs or growing jobs for the purpose  that the distinguished gentleman from Texas mentioned, how are we going  to focus on the distribution and the administration of the vaccine?  Where do you think that happens but in city, county, and State  hospitals, in large measure, by healthcare workers in those places,  wherever it is distributed on an individual basis? They are the heart  of the matter.  That is why we need to go forward with another bill that invests in  our State and local governments, not to talk about government, but to  talk about services, healthcare services, education, transportation,  making our lives possible, making our very existence possible by what  they do. Without them, how do we function?  Again, let's create jobs, let's save jobs, let's grow jobs by  administering this vaccine as fairly and as equitably as possible, and  free to everyone in our country, because unless all of us are  protected, none of us are protected.  This $2,000, which I thank you for bringing it to the floor on  Christmas Eve, was roundly rejected by Republicans. We asked for  unanimous consent. This could already exist as a law if that had  happened, but it didn't. So, now, today, we have another chance.  Some of the Republicans said: Oh, if they really wanted that, they  would have called for a vote that day.  That wasn't true. It is important to note that was a pro forma  session, and you had to have the consent of the Republicans to bring  the bill to the floor. They withheld their consent.  So, here we are today, in a legislative day where we just act with  the majority to bring the legislation to the floor.  Madam Speaker, I hope it will enjoy strong bipartisan support. The  President of the United States has put this forth as something that he  wants to see, in part of his signing the legislation yesterday. I hope  that that view will be shared by the Republicans in the Senate because  we will pass this bill today, either under suspension or under a rule,  where it just requires a majority vote.  Under suspension, a two-thirds vote requires a large number of  Republican votes, which I hope we will have because I do think that the  American people would love to see that unity on their behalf.  We are a consumer economy. Putting money into the hands of the  American people is a boost to our economy. This isn't a big stimulus  package. The COVID bill is an emergency supplemental. But this piece  will make it something very important to growing and sustaining our  economy.  Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for the work that your committee  did, Brandon and the others, for putting in the dependent clause.  Otherwise, 16 years and under would get the direct payment. But, I  mean, as a mother of five and grandmother of nine, I know that children  are dependent after 16 years of age, especially if they are still in  school. There are others who are dependent because of one thing or  another, some physical challenges that they may have in life. Who knows  what goes on in a family?  Nonetheless, if they are dependent, they will be receiving a direct  payment, another important boost for American working families, another  important boost for our economy as we go forward.  So I, again, thank the chairman for his work. It is a simple vote.  Our goals have been to crush the virus, honor our heroes who help us  crush the virus, and put money in the pockets of the American people.  Today, we will be doing that right now.  Legislation will be a lifeline for millions of Americans. It improves  on the previously passed relief bill by including dependents, ensuring  that families with children in college, adults living with  disabilities, or elderly family members can also receive relief.  The Republicans have a choice. The Republicans have a choice: vote  for this legislation or vote to deny the American people the bigger  paychecks they need. To reject this would be a denial of the economic  challenges that people are facing, and it would deny them, again, the  relief they need.  Madam Speaker, I urge a strong bipartisan vote for the aptly named  CASH Act.    "

411,Ed Perlmutter,0.8610418438911438,D,perlmutter,perlmutter," Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, the second purpose I rise today is to  respond to one of my friends who is questioning the validity of the  election. He couldn't be more wrong. The gentleman from Alabama and I  work on legislation together. We cosponsored a bill that was just  signed. But with respect to his allegations and the allegations of  attorneys that there has been major fraud in this election, I can tell  you that they couldn't be more wrong. There is not a shred of evidence.  I would say to my friend, under the Constitution--under Article I,  Section 1.4--the States are in charge of their elections. And under the  section concerning the Presidency, Article II, Section 4, we choose  when we hear from the electors of the electoral college--which will be  January 6. But citing a New York Post article of an unnamed Democrat,  who supposedly is an expert in elections, certainly is not evidence.  In the cases across the country, there has been no evidence, and case  after case has been thrown out, as they deserve to be thrown out. In  fact, the Supreme Court just threw out a case yesterday concerning  claims against Pennsylvania and its election process.  Mr. Speaker, I don't understand how these attorneys can bring these  cases without facing sanctions by the various courts for bringing  frivolous, vexatious, and abusive litigation. This election was fair.  There have been many instances where they are trying to find some level  of fraud. No fraud has been found. Joe Biden is the President-elect,  and we will make him President on January 20, when the inauguration  occurs.    "
412,Scott Perry,0.3509203791618347,R,perry,perry," Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my friend, the gentleman  from Florida, in support of this important resolution.  We know as a fact, confirmed by Reuters, the New York Post, and many  other news outlets, that the Chinese Communist Party has recently  forced 500,000 Tibetans into labor camps--500,000.  Through these camps the CCP wishes to sinicize the Tibetan people and  destroy their religious and cultural heritage and national identity.  If you asked the General Secretary Xi Jinping why his country  continues to undermine the national identity of the Tibetan people, he  would tell you that his party's initiative is simply part of a poverty  alleviation program wherein the CCP hopes to move surplus rural labor  to other parts of the country. It is absurd, and it is outrageous. The  fact that a foreign leader could believe that this kind of public  policy is morally acceptable is beyond me, and it is beyond the  civilized world. We have heard similar explanations before.  We know what these so-called poverty alleviation programs are really  about: Xi Jinping desperately wants to crush the spirits of those who  are living under his dictatorial regime. He wants to indoctrinate  people in those camps and ruthlessly marginalize their identities.  Mr. Speaker, you don't need camps for people who are seeking to do  better in their life; you just give them the opportunity, and they will  do it. They don't need to go to camp to do that.  He will fail in his effort. Make no mistake about it. He will fail  spectacularly in his effort to quash the hopes of millions of Tibetans  who dare to dream and fight for a free nation. One of the reasons he  will fail is because the United States is with the people of Tibet.  Our Tibetan friends have long since recognized the significance of  the genuine autonomy of Tibet, and today I am proud to join them.    "
413,Scott Peters,1.6990368366241455,D,peters,peters," Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  For 40 years, the city of San Diego has treated the region's sewage  through the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant. It is a chemically  enhanced primary treatment facility that treats wastewater to a level  that can be discharged into the ocean without harming the environment.  The Clean Water Act generally requires sewer systems to implement a  secondary level of treatment. However, scientists at the Scripps  Institution of Oceanography have consistently said that forcing San  Diego ratepayers to pay billions of dollars to upgrade the Point Loma  facility to secondary treatment would be a waste of money because the  enhanced advanced treatment the plant currently provides, combined with  its 4-mile-long outfall, causes no harm to the ocean environment. In  fact, the construction of a new facility along the coastline could do  more harm than good. For these reasons, San Diego has been allowed to  avoid building a new facility through a Federal waiver process at a  cost of millions of dollars every 5 years.  Water has always been in short supply in southern California, yet,  during my first years on the San Diego City Council in the early 2000s,  I was one of only three council members to support blackwater recycling  to improve the reliability of our regional water supply.  Even though all water is recycled, our opponents at the time dubbed  it ``toilet to tap.'' Now, however, we recognize that historic  droughts, combined with the shortage of melting snow, have made our  water supply shortage a permanent challenge for the West. And today,  San Diego's proposed water recycling plan with the more accurate  moniker, the ``pure water program,'' has widespread support from among  local elected leaders, environmental advocates, and State regulators.  In 2019, I introduced the Ocean Pollution Reduction Act II, or OPRA  II, to support the dual goals of increasing fresh water supply and  reducing pollution output to the ocean.  Under OPRA II, the city of San Diego must demonstrate that the pure  water program can produce 83 million gallons a day of water by 2036.  This is an estimated one-third of the entire city's drinking water  needs. Over the same period, the program is expected to reduce  pollution discharge from the Point Loma plant by over 100 million  gallons.  Pure water will still require substantial investment from San Diego  ratepayers; however, this bill replaces the complex and expensive  secondary treatment waiver application with a simpler and more  environmentally effective process if the city meets stringent water  recycling milestones.  OPRA II has been a decades-long labor of love among the city of San  Diego, its regional partners, and State and Federal Government. It will  deploy cost-effective technology and will protect our region's water  sources, technology that could one day be deployed by other vulnerable  communities to help address water shortage issues.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I thank my  colleagues.    "
414,Collin Peterson,0.5527387261390686,D,peterson,peterson," Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I thank the gentleman for his kind words and for his willingness to  work with us over these last number of years.  With this bill, we got just about all of our work done. We have the  CFTC reauthorization we didn't get done, but everything else is off the  plate. So that is good.  We made good progress. We will, both of us, ride off into the sunset,  I think, feeling that we have done a decent job.  So, again, I thank Mr. Conaway and all members of the committee for  the work that they do and wish them well in the next Congress.  Mr. Speaker, I ask everybody to unanimously support "", S. 4054, ', and I  yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, ', S. 4054, '.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
415,Dean Phillips,1.7179830074310303,D,phillips,phillips," Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor my  dear friend and colleague, Representative Harley Rouda, on the occasion  of his 59th birthday today.  Congressman Rouda is as passionate as he is principled, and a  reliable voice of reason during very unreasonable times. In celebrating  him today, I am reminded of the words of Teddy Roosevelt, who wrote:  It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out   how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could   have [[', Page , H7140, ]  done them better. The credit belongs to the man who was   actually in the arena, who actually strives to do the deeds,   and spends himself in a worthy cause.  Mr. Speaker, just like the former President, I know that Harley's  place will always be in the arena and never on the sidelines.  Annalise joins my family and yours--Kaira, Trace, Avery, Shea, and  Dylan--in wishing Harley a happy and healthy birthday and a whole lot  of love.    "
416,Chellie Pingree,0.7839431762695312,D,pingree,pingree," Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, on January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court  ruled, 7-2, that women have the right to make their own healthcare  decisions and to legally access abortion care. Forty-seven years later,  our country has seen significant social and economic progress since Roe  v. Wade.  Seventy-three percent of Americans support keeping Roe v. Wade the  law of the land. They agree we can't go back. And yet, nearly 50 years  after Roe became settled law, abortion is still under attack by extreme  politicians who believe the government should dictate whether and when  to have a child.  From 2011 to 2018, States across our country enacted 424 separate  restrictions on abortion. In 2016, Donald Trump campaigned on a promise  of appointing Justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade, and he has  appointed more than one-quarter of all active judges to date.  His administration has pushed a domestic gag rule to prohibit doctors  from telling women about their legal right to access abortion and  slashed access to family planning funding in the process.  As we honor the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, we must expand abortion  access for women across the country and stand up to the senseless  attacks on women's health.    "
417,Stacey Plaskett,0.3708006739616394,D,plaskett,plaskett," Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues, and while I am  happy to support measures to improve resiliency in the Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure, a committee on which I serve, I am  disappointed that this bill is not inclusive of U.S. territories other  than Puerto Rico in the normal operation of this new resiliency  program.  Under the Stafford Act, the Virgin Islands and all other U.S.  territories and the District of Columbia are defined and treated as  States. This legislative amendment to the Stafford Act should be no  different. That is why the House version of this bill was amended in  committee, so that this new program is equally inclusive of all  jurisdictions that are already treated as States by the Stafford Act.  That was not what was approved by the committee but passed by this  House in ', H.R. 2, ', the Moving Forward Act.  Madam Speaker, the Virgin Islands and the other smaller territories  have been devastated by unprecedented natural disasters in recent  years. All of these American jurisdictions have tremendous need for  hazard mitigation projects that reduce risks for homeowners,  businesses, nonprofits, the cost of insurance claims, and Federal  relief payments from extreme weather-related disasters.  I believe it is unfair to have a program that first makes grants to  Indian Tribes, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia to improve  resiliency, and then tells the four remaining smaller jurisdictions,  defined as States already, that they get to have what amounts to  pennies maybe left over from the 2 percent set aside of funding that  first is going to be spent on administrative costs and technical  assistance to give the resiliency program to everyone else.  Madam Speaker, as a practical matter, of course, that will amount to  nothing left for the people of my district, American Samoa, Guam, the  Northern Marianas, and the smaller territories.  Madam Speaker, I understand and have been told that the committee is  willing to work and try to find a technical fix to this both in the  House and the Senate. I urge that that occurs. While I support this  measure, once again, you cannot continue to forget the smaller  territories. [[', Page , H7268, ]    Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.  Madam Speaker, I do say, first off, I truly appreciate the words and  the passion from my good friend from the U.S. Virgin Islands (Ms.  Plaskett). I am disappointed to see that this bill came back from the  Senate without the provisions that we supported on her behalf in the  committee.  Madam Speaker, I, too, would like to echo to the Senate and to the  House as we move into the future: Let's address this concern. There is  bipartisan support for what Ms. Plaskett is asking for.  These are the types of bipartisan issues that we usually try and  solve in the House, but, unfortunately, we got this from the Senate. We  will let them be the ones to admit they screwed this up with a  technical error.  But let's fix it. That is the key. Let's work together to make that  happen.  Madam Speaker, in closing, "", S. 3418, "" will help support critical  mitigation projects in local communities, including rural communities  that are hit and devastated by these natural disasters. This will save  lives and prevent damage and loss to farmers, businesses, and  homeowners across the country, and it is also going to save, long term,  billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars that are going, time and  time again, to help communities recover from events we know are going  to happen.  Let's do something on the front end and save taxpayer dollars for the  next generation on the back end.  Madam Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn't thank the staff on both  sides of the aisle for their work to get this bill to a good place and  with the Senate: on the majority side, Aaron Davis; on our own side,  Johanna Hardy; and in my office, Jimmy Ballard. I really appreciate all  these folks and what they have done to help districts like mine.  I also thank some folks who really worked hard on this bill, too,  that are with me here today from the committee: Corey Cooke and her  number one fan, her puppy, Coda Cooke; and also Tara Hupman and her  number one fan, her puppy, Chester Hupman. I certainly hope my number  one fans, when I get home, Rider and Julia Davis, one day get a chance  to meet theirs.  But it takes people working together to get things done, and these  are the types of issues that show our success in this institution.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
418,Mark Pocan,0.7891302704811096,D,pocan,pocan," Mr. POCAN. Madam Speaker, this President is on a warpath to destroy  the Postal Service and, through that, our elections.  After months of hearing this President, and now Republican Members of  Congress, spread conspiracy theories and misinformation about voting by  mail, he has made GOP megadonor Louis DeJoy his new chief of chaos in  voter suppression.  In an attack on the Postal Service, DeJoy has removed mail processing  equipment, collection boxes, and cut back on overtime. Ninety  Democrats, led by Congresswoman Katherine Clark and me, already  demanded his immediate removal.  Because, on top of this blatant voter suppression, Trump and DeJoy  are hurting millions who depend on the Postal Service every day:  seniors and veterans waiting for lifesaving medications, families  waiting for paychecks, small businesses with delayed packages whose  very survival is already threatened by COVID-19.  On Thursday, the Progressive Caucus held a hearing and heard from  David Williams, the former vice president of the Postal Service Board  of Directors, who resigned in protest to Trump's actions. What he told  us, unfortunately, shocked no one: that the Postal Service was fully  prepared for mail voting until this administration manufactured an  intentional crisis; that DeJoy wasn't selected by the firm that was  hired to find a new Postmaster General, but he was the only candidate  interviewed and was unqualified to lead the Postal Service; and that  Steve Mnuchin sought intrusive control over core Postal Service  operations and wanted to impose a pricing practice that would ruin the  Postal Service.  This chaos is not the result of a pandemic. This chaos was  manufactured by the administration and is intentional.  That is why Congress is acting today.  We are reversing Louis DeJoy's disastrous actions and providing the  Postal Service with the funding it so desperately needs. We won't let  anyone dismantle our Postal Service. The Postal Service belongs to the  people.  {time} 1045    "
419,Katie Porter,1.0244126319885254,D,porter,porter," Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Under the Higher Education Act, students who are defrauded by private  predatory colleges are entitled to relief on their loans. The prior  administration created a streamlined process to help defrauded  borrowers access relief and move forward with their lives.  Secretary DeVos tried to strip those protections away, but we fought  back. Some of my Republican colleagues in the House and Senate voted  with us to overturn Secretary Betsy DeVos' new rule. We came together  to defend students and to stand up against fraud, waste, and abuse.  But President Trump vetoed this important resolution. Instead of  standing with students and taxpayers, President Trump stood with  corrupt private colleges and Secretary DeVos.  Today, I ask my Republican friends: Do you want to stand with our  country's students, with the future of our workforce and our  communities, or do you want to betray them to please the President? I  think the choice is clear, and I hope you do, too.    "
420,Bill Posey,0.6386681199073792,R,posey,posey," Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I was hopeful that this resolution would  lead us to common ground. None of us here believes in discriminating  against our fellow Asian-American neighbors.  On March 23, President Trump said the Asian-American community ought  to be ``totally protected'' in light of the xenophobic attacks during  the coronavirus pandemic. ``It is very important that we totally  protect our Asian-American community in the United States and all  around the world,'' President Trump tweeted.  ``They're amazing people, and the spreading of the virus is not their  fault in any way, shape, or form,'' he said. ``They're working closely  with us to get rid of it,'' the President added. ``We will prevail  together.''  I have restauranteurs in my district who suffered from bullies  because of their heritage, so I asked my staff to prepare a resolution  to echo the President's sentiments. My staff reported to me that such a  resolution already existed, "", H. Res. 908, "", ostensibly to protect Asian  Americans.  On April 7, I signed onto what I considered to be a good faith effort  to protect Asian Americans. I am more than saddened to see that this  resolution and today's debate is being used for nothing more than to  malign and vilify the President of the United States, just as the  President and congressional Republicans have been called domestic  enemies in the last couple of days. I would hope for more, but, sadly,  this body has chosen to take the low road.  This debate has devolved into finger-pointing, name-calling, and  scoring political points. Rather than reaching a high watermark for  bringing us all together, it has further ripped apart the fabric of  America. I am deeply disappointed and will not be a party to today's  partisan exercise that is more about scoring political points than  rebuilding America.  We should be working together to help all Americans recover, to  investigate COVID-19, which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of  deaths around the world, trillions lost and trillions more spent  responding to COVID. Lives and dreams have been shattered.  We have a duty to all Americans to find a cure, to get to the bottom  of just how this pandemic started, and to do what we can to prevent it  from happening ever again in the future.    "
421,Ayanna Pressley,0.6695979833602905,D,pressley,pressley," Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the people who  are struggling and feel abandoned by their government during this  crisis.  I rise in solidarity with every parent who has struggled to buy  diapers and formula, every family behind on rent or crushed by the  grief of an empty chair at the kitchen table.  Our people are crying out, sick, tired, hungry, and broken. The  people we have taken an oath to serve and protect need direct cash to  survive the winter. We must send them survival checks immediately.  Some of my colleagues are patting themselves on the back for sending  corporations payouts--corporations, by the way, that have profited off  of people during this pandemic--and shaming families on the edge. Shame  on them for their theatrics and their callousness.  450 pennies a day for the last 9 months, that is what our government  has sent the American people to weather this crisis, and nothing for  the immigrant families who drive our essential workforce.  It didn't have to be this way. Our families deserve direct cash, real  survival checks.  Madam Speaker, $600 is hardly sufficient. It is an insult. We must  act to save lives now. The pandemic has not discriminated in its  hardship, but it would seem compassion and empathy have.    "
422,David Price,0.4879726469516754,D,price,price," Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a  faithful servant of the people's House, Parliamentarian Tom Wickham.  Tom is only the fifth Parliamentarian in this institution's history,  and he is concluding his 25 years of service in the Parliamentarian's  Office this week.  One of the distinguishing features of Tom's service has been his work  with the House Democracy Partnership and his willingness to extend  himself internationally, to share his experiences and insight with  those organizing and administering parliaments in emerging, often  struggling democracies.  Just last fall, Members would have been heartened to see the  reception that Tom, along with Clerk Cheryl Johnson and Shuwanza Goff,  received from their counterparts in Kenya, Liberia, Ethiopia, and The  Gambia.  We have all benefited from Tom's dedicated service and the skill,  integrity, and fairness he has brought to the Parliamentarian's role.  We wish him and his family Godspeed as they begin the next chapter of  their lives.    "
423,Mike Quigley,2.053528308868408,D,quigley,quigley," Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am  sure not everyone on the other side would agree with that, or on this  side either.  I rise today in strong support of this bill, and I want to thank  Chairman Neal and Members Moulton and King for a bill that will surely  bring hope and dignity to ALS patients and caregivers.  The 5-month waiting period is simply unacceptable for a disease like  ALS, and I am glad that Congress is finally righting this wrong.  Over the past 2 years, it has been an honor for me to partner with  the ALS community. For too long, ALS has flown under the radar. It has  gone underfunded, underresearched, and unnoticed. But that is rapidly  changing, thanks to the efforts of patient advocates fighting for their  own lives and the lives of those not yet diagnosed.  I would like to give a special shout-out to my friends and  Chicagoans, Brian Wallach and Sandra Abrevaya, the husband and wife  cofounders of I AM ALS, and to Dan Tate, Jr. They are tireless,  selfless patient advocates. Without them, we simply wouldn't be here  today.  I want to thank you all for bringing this bill to the floor. I am  proud to be an original cosponsor and welcome its bipartisan support.    "
424,Aumua Radewagen,0.32861772179603577,R,radewagen,radewagen," Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Chabot for  yielding time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of ', H.R. 8229, ', the Parity for HUBZone  Appeals [[', Page , H6079, ] Act of 2020. I thank Ms. Houlahan for her collaboration on this  important legislation.  SBA's various small business contracting programs support different  types of entrepreneurs, from women and service-disabled veterans to  minorities and the economically disadvantaged, by providing these  businesses with special Federal contracting preferences.  Whether a business holds a specific status is critical in determining  whether that company is eligible to compete for these special contract  opportunities. Not only does the business have a vested interest in  obtaining and maintaining its status, but the Federal Government also  has an interest in making sure these special contracts are not awarded  to fraudulent firms. If a company is suspected to be ineligible for a  status it claims to hold, an interested party can protest the firm's  status.  Currently, for Historically Underutilized Business Zone-qualified, or  HUBZone-qualified, small businesses, the final arbiter of a firm's  special HUBZone status is the Associate Administrator of the Office of  Government Contracting and Business Development, or AA-GCBD. This  differs significantly from SBA's other Federal contracting programs in  which SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals, or OHA, is the final  decisionmaker of a firm's protested status.  OHA, unlike the AA-GCBD, is an independent office of the SBA. Leaving  the appeal decision to the AA-GCBD raises questions of conflict of  interest, whereas housing that process at OHA will ensure the decision  remains separate and independent from any influence.  Furthermore, the AA-GCBD has many competing priorities and  responsibilities in overseeing all the SBA's Federal contracting  programs. In contrast, OHA administrative judges are primarily tasked  with adjudicating similar types of appeals and, thus, are well trained  and well versed in making educated decisions objectively and  impartially. Thus, passage of this bill means that small businesses  will have a greater chance of having a fair and knowledgeable  assessment of their case.  Finally, the AA-GCBD's appeals decisions are currently made in a  vacuum. There is no visibility into the reasons why a decision was  reached. In contrast, all of OHA's decisions are published online and  easily searchable. These opinions are critical for small businesses to  obtain a greater understanding of the rules surrounding their  eligibility. Therefore, shifting the responsibility to hear HUBZone  appeals to OHA will provide the public with much-needed guidance and  transparency.  In sum, "", H.R. 8229, "" will bring greater parity, fairness, and  transparency between SBA's HUBZone program and its other Federal  contracting programs.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  legislation.    "
425,Jamie Raskin,0.2813394367694855,D,raskin,raskin," Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill ("", S. 5036, ') to amend the Overtime Pay for  Protective Services Act of 2016 to extend the Secret Service overtime  pay exception through 2023, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Cuellar). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Maryland?  There was no objection.  The text of the bill is as follows:  ', S. 5036, ""  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of   the United States of America in Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ``Secret Service Overtime Pay   Extension Act''.  SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF OVERTIME PAY EXCEPTION THROUGH 2023 FOR   PROTECTIVE SERVICES.  (a) In General.--Section 2 of the Overtime Pay for   Protective Services Act of 2016 (5 U.S.C. 5547 note) is   amended--  (1) in the section heading, by striking ``2020'' and   inserting ``2023'';  (2) in subsection (a), by striking ``during 2016, 2017,   2018, 2019, or 2020'' and inserting ``during any of calendar   years 2016 through 2023''; and  (3) in subsection (b)(1)--  (A) by inserting ``for a given calendar year'' after ``for   premium pay''; and  (B) by striking ``during 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020''   and inserting ``during each of calendar years 2016 through   2023''.  (b) Reports.--  (1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term ``appropriate   committees of Congress'' means the Committee on   Appropriations, the Committee on Homeland Security and   Governmental Affairs, and the Committee on the Judiciary of   the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee   on Oversight and Reform, and the Committee on the Judiciary   of the House of Representatives.  (2) Report on extensions.--Not later than January 30 of   each of calendar years 2021, 2022, and 2023, the Director of   the United States Secret Service shall submit to the   appropriate committees of Congress a report on the effects of   the amendments made by subsection (a) and the amendments made   by section 2(a) of the Secret Service Overtime Pay Extension   Act (Public Law 115-383; 132 Stat. 5121), which shall   include, with respect to the previous calendar year, the   information described under paragraphs (1) through (7) of   section 2(c) of the Secret Service Recruitment and Retention   Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-160; 132 Stat. 1246).  (3) Open recommendations.--Not later than 60 days after the   date of enactment of this Act, the Director of the United   States Secret Service shall submit to the appropriate   committees of Congress a report discussing the progress of   the United States Secret Service in implementing each   recommendation of the Government Accountability Office to the   United States Secret Service that has not been designated as   closed by the Comptroller General of the United States.  (4) Protective mission panel.--Not later than 1 year after   the date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of   the United States shall submit to the appropriate committees   of Congress a report on the extent of the progress made by   the United States Secret Service in implementing the   recommendations of the United States Secret Service   Protective Mission Panel, including in particular those items   pertaining to training and personnel enumerated in the   Executive Summary to Report from the United States Secret   Service Protective Mission Panel to the Secretary of Homeland   Security dated December 15, 2014.  (c) Repeal of Superseded Reporting Requirement.--Section   2(b) of the Secret Service Overtime Pay Extension Act (Public   Law 115-383; 132 Stat. 5121) is repealed.  The bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third  time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
426,John Ratcliffe,0.4992993175983429,R,ratcliffe,ratcliffe," Mr. RATCLIFFE. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Neguse and Ranking  Member McClintock for their leadership on this committee.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of "", H.R. 2819, "", the Gold Star  Families National Monument Extension Act.  I was very pleased to have the opportunity to introduce this  bipartisan bill, along with my Democratic colleague, the gentleman from  New Jersey, Congressman Kim, on behalf of our Nation's Gold Star  Families.  The term ``Gold Star Family'' dates back to World War I, when flags  were displayed bearing a blue star to represent a family member serving  abroad and gold stars used to designate family members who had been  lost in combat.  As the Representative of a congressional district in northeast Texas  with more than 50,000 veterans, and thousands and thousands of active  duty servicemembers, this bill very much hits home.  My home State of Texas is home to 1 of every 10 U.S. servicemembers,  and nearly 25,000 Texas families have joined the National Gold Star  Family Registry since World War II.  The families of all the individuals who serve our country know the  great sacrifices that are made when a loved one answers the call of  duty because, unfortunately, all of our heroes don't always make it  back home; and it is their families who will forever bear the burden of  that ultimate sacrifice when they don't return home.  As a grateful Nation, it must be our constant priority to honor our  fallen heroes and their families. After all, we owe our freedom to  their great sacrifice.  I am confident that the Gold Star Families National Monument will  help ensure that we honor our fallen heroes and their families on a  national scale by extending the authorization for the establishment of  a national monument located right in here in Washington, D.C.  The Gold Star Family Monument will be constructed at no cost to  taxpayers, as all of the funds that are being raised are being raised  by the Gold Star Mothers National Monument Foundation.  I am grateful for the opportunity that the Gold Star Family Monument  will provide to all of our citizens to pause and honor the ultimate  sacrifices made by our fallen servicemen and servicewomen on our behalf  as they visit our Nation's capital.  Despite the often polarized political climate in Washington, this is  an issue that people across the political spectrum should all be able  to stand behind.  Again, I thank my Democratic colleague, Congressman Kim, for his  leadership on this important effort, and I urge the rest of our  colleagues for their strong support on the floor today.    "
427,Tom Reed,0.8398455381393433,R,reed,reed," Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the HOSPICE bill,  which is a part of the overall BENES Act we are debating today. And I  am proud to support the HOSPICE bill that I introduced and authored  with my good friend, Jimmy Panetta, from California.  Madam Speaker, I can tell you, when loved ones, like my mother,  became sick, it is common to be left feeling helpless and for families  not having the resources to deal with that terrible situation. But I  thank God every day we were able to support my mother with a wonderful  team, not only of our family but of our hospice care providers. They  gave her, and they gave us, the needed companionship and resources to  have some sense of normalcy at the end of her illness. That experience  reaffirmed the critical importance of the quality-of-life care that  hospice care represents.  Madam Speaker, that is why I am a hospice volunteer in my personal  time here in Washington, D.C. I am a strong advocate for hospice care  across America.  However, while most hospice employees and volunteers and  compassionate caregivers are good, hardworking individuals, there are  some who neglect and potentially even abuse patients in that situation.  We must hold those bad actors accountable. We must demand additional  oversight of hospice providers. We must educate providers with  additional training to ensure patients receive the best and most proper  level of care they deserve.  We are confident this legislation would do just that by giving HHS  the tools it needs to penalize those that provide poor quality care.  Our legislation would also improve provider transparency by requiring  States to maintain a toll-free hotline where abuse and neglect can be  reported.  Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand in support of this legislation.  More importantly, I am proud to be a hospice volunteer myself, and I am  proud to stand with the hospice community that is giving so much great  quality care to those that need it most in their most precious time  that they have left.  Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill and the  underlying legislation upon which it rides.    "

It is easy to talk, but actions speak louder  than words.  Republicans have offered plan after plan to help ordinary people who  need it and to help small businesses struggling to survive, businesses  like the 1,700 restaurants along the Myrtle Beach Grand Strand back  home that have been devastated by this pandemic. If Speaker Pelosi  would allow a vote on any of these bills, they would pass the House and  Senate easily, and folks back home would get the help they need.  But Democrats have blocked every plan to help the little guy unless  we also bail out broke blue States and restore the deduction for State  and local taxes for millionaires and billionaires. You see, 90 percent  of the benefit of the State tax deduction goes to earners in the top 10  percent. Over 50 percent of the benefit goes to millionaires and  billionaires in the top 1 percent, who don't need a bailout.  Take Michael Bloomberg, for example. He made over $3.5 billion last  year. Mr. Bloomberg works in New York City, which has a combined State  and local income tax rate of 12.5 percent. That means restoring the  State and local tax deduction would reduce Mr. Bloomberg's taxes by  $160 million. That is right, Mr. Bloomberg would get a $160 million  bailout.  For months, the Democratic leadership has held back help for the  little guy who desperately needs it as ransom unless we agree to give a  bailout to billionaires like Michael Bloomberg, who would get an extra  $160 million. Why would they do that?  Remember in the Presidential debate when Michael Bloomberg bragged  that he spent $100 million to buy 21 new Democrat seats and put Nancy  Pelosi in charge?

[["", Page , H3650, ]  To pay for this legislation, what we do is go straight to Alabama,  Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas and take $1.9 billion a year of  potential revenue to those States to uplift their people to pay for  this bill.  Let me be specific about Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana. They  rank 48th, 49th, and 50th in terms of quality of life for their  residents. They rank 1, 2, and 5 in terms of their African-American  population.  So, what are we doing here, in this time of racial inequity? We are  going to Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana and taking $1.9 billion a  year without sharing any of that revenue with their States where: they  can improve education, where all three rank last; they can improve  healthcare, where all three States rank last; and they can improve  their environment, where all three States are in the bottom one-third.  So, all I am saying is, at some point, equity demands that those  States get their fair share.    "
432,Denver Riggleman,0.31677141785621643,R,riggleman,riggleman," Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my gratitude and  appreciation for Esther Page, my constituent services director.  Known as the Constituent Whisperer and Queen of Casework, Esther is  retiring this January after 31 years of service.  She truly is the model of what a nonpartisan public servant should  be, having shown the same care and devotion for Virginia's Fifth  District even as the seat swapped back and forth between parties.  I will read a comment from one of my constituents who benefited from  Ms. Page's service: ``I felt from her very first contact that she was  committed to advocating for me and my best interests. Without Ms. Page,  I truly believe that I would still be waiting, my case file deeply  buried on someone's desk.''  Her devout faith was an example to me and all constituents she  helped. She will be retiring to her home in Nelson County this January,  and I wish her a long and fulfilling retirement.  Esther, I think I speak for all the Fifth District in offering my  deepest appreciation for the service you have done.  This is not in the speech but know that we all love you.    "
433,Martha Roby,0.029820406809449196,R,roby,roby," Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), my friend, for yielding.  Thank you so much, Leader Hoyer, I just appreciate your friendship  all these years. I really do appreciate the time you have given me.  Mr. Speaker, I rise before you and my colleagues here today to speak  for my final time on the House floor.  Mr. Speaker, 17 years ago, my husband, Riley, and I prayerfully  decided I would put my name on the ballot for the first time. Never  could we have imagined that that original decision to run for the  Montgomery City Council would lead us to serve five terms in the U.S.  House of Representatives.  We are so grateful that God allowed us to serve our country in this  way, and we give all honor and glory to Him. I count it a great  privilege to have served the people of Alabama's Second Congressional  District over the past decade, and I cannot adequately express how  deeply thankful I am for the confidence my constituents have placed in  me over the years.  Each of you sitting here before me knows the responsibility that  comes along with being a Member of Congress. Yes, we are required to  vote and to be the conscience of those we represent, but serving our  constituents back home truly changes lives in our communities for the  better.  As I look back on the wonderful things Team Roby was able to  accomplish, along with the help of my colleagues in the Alabama  delegation, I realized that our most significant duty is to help those  who need us. Whether it is requesting assistance with the VA or another  Federal agency, assisting with cleanup following a large-scale weather  event, voicing an opinion, or booking tours of the U.S. Capitol, my  doors have always remained open to each person I represent.  I am thankful for the unique opportunities given to me by those who  came before me, especially the chance to serve on several impactful  committees, including Committee on Appropriations, Committee on the  Judiciary, Committee on Agriculture, Committee on Armed Services,  Committee on Education and the Workforce, and the Select Committee on  Benghazi. Much [["", Page , H7027, ] work has been done in each of these revered committees to impact the  lives of my constituents, and for that, I am forever grateful.  I have been asked many times over the past few months what will I  miss the most upon my departure, and my answer has remained the same-- the relationships.  The genuine friendships formed with my colleagues, my constituents,  and so many others over the years, and interacting with these  individuals on a daily basis is what I will truly miss the most. For  many, this past year was and continues to be very challenging. We have  all experienced plenty of unfamiliar hardships. Not only has the global  health pandemic taken center stage, but America is marked by intense  division and polarization. Every time you turn on the television, you  see a depiction of disunity amongst the American people. I imagine many  Americans struggle to believe that friendship can actually exist within  the Halls of Congress.  It is incumbent upon us, Members of Congress, to join forces and work  together to get things done for the good of the American people. When  we reach across the aisle and work with the other side to arrive at a  compromise for the benefit of those we serve, we are truly at our best.  I believe the American people are starving to see bipartisanship in  action, especially during this time of much suffering and uncertainty.  People want to know their leaders are working together for the common  good and not just shouting each other down.  My greatest hope and prayer moving forward is that all Members of  Congress--new and old--regardless of party identification, beliefs, or  opinions, will come together and work toward a common goal to deliver  real results for the American people. I have faith in this institution,  and I have faith in each of you.  Now, I want to especially thank the people of the Second District. It  is your faith and trust in me as your representative that helped me  every step of the way. I am honored to have been given this incredibly  unique opportunity, and I thank you for letting me be your voice in  Congress.  Together, we have been able to deliver some incredible results for  our military, veterans, agricultural community, and the unborn. While  we made much progress together, the fight is not finished.  I want to thank my Congressional colleagues for your kindness and  friendship throughout the years. Not too far into my time in Congress,  I woke up realizing that the people I served with had become some of my  very best friends. I am confident these relationships will continue,  and I will certainly miss our time spent together having conversations  about our families and encouraging one another.  I want to thank my incredible staff, all former and present Members  of Team Roby, for your hard work on behalf of the people of Alabama and  our country. I know all Members say this, but I truly believe I have  the greatest staff in the world. I would never be able to execute this  job without the dedication and support of my staff. They have worked  tirelessly to serve the people of the Second District. We have a  special saying on our team: ``Once Team Roby, always Team Roby.''  And lastly, I thank my husband, Riley, and our two children, Margaret  and George, my parents, the Robys, and our entire village for  supporting our decision to serve our country. Your steadfast love and  constant support have carried us through the easy and the hard times,  and I love each of you dearly.  On behalf of Riley, Margaret, George, and myself, we sincerely thank  all of you who made our service to our country in the great State of  Alabama possible and those who offered their services along the way.  Thank you, and for the very last time, I yield back.    "

435,Harold Rogers,0.019880272448062897,R,rogers,rogers," Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Thornberry  and Chairman Smith for their leadership in this essential process to  ensure America's security.  This bill takes important steps forward to confront China by  establishing the Indo-Pacific Deterrence Initiative. It is vital that  we support and strengthen our allies and partners in the region in  order to deter the growing threat from China.  This NDAA also funds critical investments here at home that will  enable us [["", Page , H6926, ] to confront the sophisticated threats we face from China and Russia.  The NDAA also includes provisions implementing a number of Cyber  Solarium recommendations. These changes will continue to modernize our  military and civilian cybersecurity efforts. I think that we have only  begun our work in this area.  In addition to these cutting-edge needs, this conference report also  reauthorizes the pay to troop deployed in combat zones.  Most importantly, this bill adheres to the budget agreement and fully  funds the President's budget request.  Now more than ever, we must reject calls for blanket defense cuts  from partisans who are using the current crisis as an opportunity to  push their agenda.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague Mac Thornberry  for his years of service and dedication to the Armed Services  Committee. No one cares more about our men and women in uniform and has  been a better leader for our conference. We are going to miss his  passion and dedication for these issues, and we wish him and Sally  nothing but the best as they go forward.    "
436,Harold Rogers,0.019880272448062897,R,rogers,rogers," Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill,  but I want to first congratulate our committee's chair and ranking  member for their great work on putting together this enormous and  enormously important bill.  First, I want to say how rare this day really is in another way. It  is the first time that we have had a ranking member who is a female,  Ms. Granger, and the first female chairman of the committee, Nita  Lowey. We will miss her enormously on this committee and in the  Chamber.  This bill is enormous. It is not perfect, but it reflects a fair  compromise that includes funding for many important priorities at home  and abroad and vital assistance for all those negatively impacted by  the coronavirus pandemic.  As ranking member of the Committee on State, Foreign Operations, and  Related Programs, I want to tell you, this bill provides critical  funding for our national security. This includes $3.3 billion in  Foreign Military Financing for Israel and robust support to combat  transnational crime and the flow of illegal drugs.  The bill is also tough on China, as it commits serious resources  behind our Indo-Pacific strategy. This includes exposing the censorship  and propaganda wielded by the Chinese Communist [["", Page , H7303, ] Party and countering Beijing's debt-trap diplomacy through well-funded,  open, and transparent U.S. development by the Development Finance  Corporation and the Countering Chinese Influence Fund.  This bill also protects our core values. It maintains all pro-life  protections from last year and rejects efforts to undo the President's  historic policies that protect the sanctity of life.  This bill is also great for my district in Kentucky, if I can be  parochial. It provides the resources we need to continue to fight the  opioid epidemic, which is now more important than ever.  It fully funds my AML pilot program, which is truly breathing life  back into my southern and eastern Kentucky communities. It helps our  small businesses and so many Kentuckians who are fighting tooth and  nail to survive the coronavirus pandemic.  This package does not have everything that we wanted, but it is a  good bill, and I think a fair compromise.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues' support.  Mr. Speaker, I want to wish everyone a merry Christmas.  {time} 1830    "

439,Francis Rooney,0.939371645450592,R,rooney,rooney," Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Madam Chairwoman, one more time, I would like  to say that the NLRB was a very important piece of legislation 70 years  ago. These little tweaks like this to update the NLRB for the modern  workforce, the volatility, the digital era, are perfectly legitimate  and logical responses to the conditions that we find ourselves in now.  We don't have carpenters who would spend their entire career at one  company anymore. They come and go at different places. It happens in  manufacturing as well. This bill would recognize that volatility and  institutionalize it in a constructive manner.  I yield back the balance of my time.    "

Madam Speaker, I rise today in memory of Dr.  Ahmad Jaber, who passed away last week after a lifetime spent building  New York's thriving Muslim-American community.  Dr. Jaber was a towering figure who rose from humble origins. He was  a proud Palestinian who won prestigious scholarships to study medicine  in Iraq, Jordan, and later to do his residency in this great country.  As a young doctor, Dr. Jaber had done and seen more than most people  do in a lifetime, but he did not stop there. He built his medical  practice in Sunset Park into a thriving business, personally delivering  more than 5,000 babies.  He attended to his community's spiritual needs, and he was a fixture  at his mosque, providing financial support as well as translating  sermons or offering medical assistance. Dr. Jaber helped found numerous  organizations throughout his life, which now carry on his legacy of  strengthening the Muslim-American community in New York and around the  country.  We need more people like Dr. Jaber in this country, people who leave  their mark on society through humble and dedicated work on behalf of  their community.  We are forever grateful to have benefited from Dr. Jaber's presence,  and he will be so deeply missed. Allah yerhamo.    "

And for the last 80 years, WHUB Newstalk 101.7 and 1400, the  Hub, has stood the test of time and been a haven for community events  and local news.  WHUB's motto is: ``Where community always comes first.'' They have  always implemented that motto for the citizens of the Upper Cumberland  in Tennessee, and they always will.

Congratulations to owner Jerry Zimmer, program director Brent Carl  Fleshman, news director Shawn Jacobs, and general manager John Monk for  their constant hard work to keep WHUB the number one news talk radio  station in the Upper Cumberland.

447,Lucille Roybal-Allard,1.1562577486038208,D,roybal-allard,roybal-allard," Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of ', H.R. 7617, "", and I  commend the chairs of the subcommittees who worked so hard to produce  funding bills that reflect our ``For the People'' vision for America.  The appropriation bills in this minibus provide critical resources  for our wide range of vital domestic and defense priorities. As vice  chair of the Labor-HHS Subcommittee, I will focus on that title of the  bill which, thanks to the efforts of Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro and  Ranking Member Cole, upholds our promise to Americans by investing in  our workers' needs, supporting the education of our children, and  ensuring all our families and communities have access to quality health  programs during this pandemic and beyond.  For example, the bill makes strong investments to strengthen the  ability of our public health system to overcome the current COVID  crisis, and equally important, to have the resources to build the  infrastructure critical to our ability to successfully address  public health challenges in the future.  Robust investments are also made to address the health disparities  COVID-19 has intensified, and the bill commissions a National Academies  of Sciences study on the most promising solutions to advance health  equity in the years ahead.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the Labor-HHS bill contains substantial  funding for many of my requests to support mothers and babies during  this pandemic and the months to follow. This includes large increases  to the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant and the Healthy  Start program, as well as strong investments in breastfeeding support  and a maternal mental health hotline.  Today, our children and families are suffering from the prolonged  isolation of school closures and the challenges of learning remotely  while parents try to work. As we fight the pandemic, this bill makes  critical investments to ensure our children safely receive a high- quality education.  During a time when so many Americans have lost jobs due to the  economic impact of this pandemic, the strong outlays in job training  and apprenticeships will help American workers gain the skills needed  to get well-paying jobs.  Mr. Speaker, Vice President Biden has said, ``Don't tell me what you  value. Show me your budget, and I will tell you what you value.''  I thank Chairmen Visclosky, Serrano, Quigley, and Price, and  Chairwomen Kaptur and DeLauro, for outlining those values so clearly in  their appropriations bill, and I urge passage of this minibus.    "
448,Raul Ruiz,2.802842855453491,D,ruiz,ruiz," Mr. RUIZ. In terms of the third violation, which is the most  outstanding and outrageous violation, it was that procedures were done  without the women's informed consent. There were gynecological  procedures, as was mentioned: total hysterectomy; partial hysterectomy;  most of them were oophorectomies; most of them were cystectomies.  But the point here is that whenever you have any gynecological  procedure, that can result in scarring, future pain, possible chronic  pain, and also infertility. Therefore, you need informed consent.  It is medical practice to have informed consent, which requires an  explanation of your disease, of the illness, of the procedure,  including risks and any alternative options, including the option of  doing nothing, in the language that the patient understands.  Not doing so, not documenting it, is a violation of that informed  consent. Violating informed consent and putting a blade to a woman's  body, without her understanding or her informed consent, is an assault.  That is why we need fully to condemn this practice. That is why we  need to fully investigate through the inspector general, through the  FBI, through the Georgia medical and surgeon license board to ensure  that this doesn't happen, that it is not happening in other private  detention facilities throughout the country, in rural areas where  perhaps they think they might get away with it because, after all,  these are very disempowered women without very strong advocacy in those  locations.  I am very thankful for the lawyers, for those that brought this to  light, [["", Page , H5651, ] that have empowered the voices, including a 22-year-old woman who now  will never be able to have children.  I support this resolution to send a very strong message to all  facilities and all doctors that every woman requires fully informed  consent before any procedure.    "
449,Dutch Ruppersberger,0.5204959511756897,D,ruppersberger,ruppersberger," Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of ', H.R. 1966, "", and I  thank the gentleman for yielding.  I proudly co-led this bill when it was first introduced by our late  friend, Elijah Cummings, in honor of the extraordinary life and legacy  of a Baltimore native, Henrietta Lacks.  Although Congressman Cummings has passed on and remains deeply  missed, I am proud and grateful that Congressman Mfume has picked up  the mantle on this important legislation.  Without her knowledge or permission, doctors used Henrietta Lacks'  cells for medical research that eventually led to some of medicine's  most critical breakthroughs, including development of the polio  vaccine, along with treatments for cancer, HIV/AIDS, leukemia, and  Parkinson's.  I can think of only a handful of Marylanders or even Americans who  have contributed more to modern medicine than Henrietta Lacks. Her  lifesaving contributions will continue to advance cures for  debilitating diseases for generations to come.  Yet more than 70 years after Henrietta Lacks' death, many communities  still face glaring health disparities. For example, while cancer  incidence rates are highest among non-Hispanic White females, non- Hispanic Black females have the highest rate of death.  Clinical trials are a key component to advancing cancer research and  treatment, but 20 percent of cancer clinical trials fail because of a  lack of patient enrollment, with racial and ethnic minorities and  older, rural, and lower-income Americans generally underrepresented in  such trials.  This bill examines access to government-funded cancer clinical trials  for traditionally underrepresented groups, but it is also about much  more.  It is about giving credit where credit has been long overdue, it is  about ensuring all Americans get the medical treatments they deserve,  and it is about ensuring clinical trials succeed because they are  inclusive.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.    "
450,Bobby Rush,1.9967020750045776,D,rush,rush," Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Bass), my friend, for her long-time and courageous  action and leadership on these important issues.  Mr. Speaker, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Christopher Whitfield,  Chad Robertson, Terence Crutcher, Philando Castile, Alton Sterling,  Bettie Jones, Quintonio LeGrier, Sandra Bland, Alfontish Cockerham,  Walter Scott, Laquan McDonald, Eric Garner, Rekia Boyd, Darrin Hanna,  Calvin Cross, Leon Brackens, Fred Hampton, Mark Clark.

Thank God for "", H.R. 7120, "", the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.  There but for the grace of God go I.    "
451,John Rutherford,0.06162884086370468,R,rutherford,rutherford," Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and good friend  from Pennsylvania for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Crisis Stabilization and  Community Reentry Act of 2020.  I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, as a former sheriff with over 40 years  of experience in law enforcement, I understand the issues people face  as they leave and transition from incarceration to a free society.  Throughout my time in law enforcement, I saw many individuals--too many  individuals--re-offend time and time again, often with the same  offenses involving substance abuse and mental health issues.  Part of the problem back then was, when a prisoner was released from  State prison, literally all we gave them was a blue bag for their  valuables and a bus ticket home. And we wondered why they failed and  returned to a life of crime--not much for rehabilitation.  So, when I became the sheriff of Jacksonville, I partnered with the  Florida Secretary of Corrections and community groups to implement  programs that provided continued treatment and services to individuals  during and after they left prison because those exiting prison systems  face numerous challenges as they go back to their communities, often  with little or no support from friends or family.  As my colleague just mentioned, the Bureau of Justice Statistics  calculates that one in seven individuals in State and Federal prisons,  and one in four individuals in jails, experience serious psychological  distress. Their battles with psychological distress and substance abuse  do not stop when they exit prison. In fact, they are exacerbated upon  their release. Indeed, during this transition phase, that support is  often needed the most.  Today's bipartisan legislation would streamline mental health and  medical services for these individuals, preventing a lapse of care  between prison and society, and, instead, creating a continuum of care  for those at greater risk of relapse.  The Crisis Stabilization and Community Reentry Act establishes a warm  handoff of care between law enforcement, community-based groups, and  mental health specialists. The partnership between law enforcement and  community groups is critical as they both share a common goal to lower  recidivism and ensure people can thrive and succeed when they return  back to their communities.  By offering grants through the Department of Justice, States and  communities would be able to provide medication-assisted treatment,  counseling, and other transition services that are prioritized for  those who need it most.  This bipartisan legislation is supported by the National Sheriffs'  Association, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the National Council  for Behavioral Health, and the National Alliance on Mental Illness, and  the Treatment Advocacy Center. [["", Page , H7216, ]  I am proud to support this initiative as a member of the  congressional bipartisan Opioid Task Force, as a member of the Mental  Health Caucus, and also as a proud member of the Law Enforcement  Caucus, because as a sheriff, I have seen firsthand and know the  success a bill like this can accomplish.  This bill is going to save lives, it is going to save money, and it  is going to reduce crime. With a renewed focus on those people in  greatest need, we can work together to ensure that pattern of  recidivism can become a problem in the past rather than one that will  be shouldered by future generations to come.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this bill, which, again, Mr. Speaker, is going to save lives,  save dollars, and reduce recidivism.    "
452,Tim Ryan,0.8535080552101135,D,ryan,ryan," Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about ', H.R. 5023, "", which  names the Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient  clinic in Youngstown, Ohio, as the Carl Nunziato VA Clinic.  This bill was recommended to my office and strongly supported by  leaders within my congressional district's veterans community because  they rightly wish to honor one of their own for his exemplary service.  I thank them and Chairman Mark Takano, Ranking Member Dr. Phil Roe, and  their respective staffs for helping our office bring this bill to the  floor, as well as my own staff, Zach Prager and Ivan De La Cruz  Santiago.  Today is a red-letter day, Mr. Speaker, in my book because in the  midst of all that is going on nationally, all the controversies,  Congress can still put its differences aside to take time and recognize  a true American hero: Carl Nunziato.  Carl was born in Youngstown, Ohio, in 1938, graduating from Rayen  High School. After marrying his high school sweetheart, Clara, he would  go on to attend college at Youngstown State University.  Through the university's Reserve Officer Training Corps program, Carl  earned a commission as a second lieutenant in the United States Army.  It was with his heart filled with love and devotion to his family, his  hometown, and his country that he set off for the battlefields of  Vietnam.  All those who served with Carl testify to his unmatched fighting  spirit. If you ever found yourself in a foxhole with chaos all around  you, Carl was the guy you wanted there with you because no matter what  happened, you could be sure of one thing: Carl would never quit. Never.  Life would test Carl in ways that most Americans can't even imagine.  On November 22, 1966, Carl lost both of his legs when an enemy mortar  round impacted less than 3 feet away from him as he was running toward  his unit's command center.  On that battlefield, and over the next 2 years at home, Carl would  fight for his life not far from where we stand today, at Walter Reed  National Military Medical Center. Carl may have walked out of that  hospital on two prosthetic legs, but his resolve was more steadfast  than before he walked in.  Carl returned to his hometown, Youngstown, Ohio, enrolled in law  school at Case Western Reserve, and with graduation began yet another  battle: the fight for veterans and all Americans with disabilities.  As an attorney utilizing a wheelchair in the 1970s, most of the  courthouses he encountered lacked the accessibility that he and other  Americans like him needed to be able to simply get his job done.  Carl saw the problem and seized the initiative, as he had always done  with obstacles he encountered in life. Carl created a committee to  fight for veterans with disabilities and became a relentless advocate  on behalf of all of those with the same conditions.  But Carl went even further. He established a task force to improve  veterans services in Youngstown at a time when the VA sent the city a  single nurse once a week when the Mahoning Valley had 40,000 veterans.  Carl wanted a VA clinic. VA said no. Carl didn't take no for an  answer. Carl's efforts came to fruition in 1991 when the VA finally  established an outpatient clinic in Youngstown.  Today, Carl continues to be a stellar citizen, not just for  Youngstown, not just for the people of Ohio, not just for vets, not  just for people with disabilities, but for all Americans.  Carl works tirelessly with the VA to continue improving the care  received by veterans. Carl relentlessly pursues improving care and  services for all Americans with disabilities.  The naming of this clinic, Mr. Speaker, is a small measure in  comparison to what he has accomplished on behalf of our country's  heroes and all of those with disabilities.  Carl never quits--never has quit, never will quit. And I am humbled  to have the privilege of representing an individual of this caliber in  this Chamber.  I will say, finally, when other vets and citizens from our community  look at Carl's portrait hanging in this clinic and they see his name,  they will know that things can get better. With effort, with grit, you  can make a difference as long as you never quit, as long as you never  take no for an answer.    "
453,Gregorio Sablan,2.349644660949707,D,sablan,sablan," Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, ', H.R. 7105, ', the Veterans Health Care and  Benefits Improvement Act, includes my bill helping get more funding for  operations and maintenance to locally-run, veterans cemeteries  nationwide.  My legislation, ', H.R. 5487, ', increases the amount the VA can grant for  this purpose each year from $5 million to $10 million. As more veterans  choose to be buried close to their home, more states, territories, and  tribal governments are applying for funding from the VA to help cover  the costs of operating and maintaining local veterans cemeteries.  And, while the list of applications grows, the amount the Department  can award has not. Under current law, no more than $5 million can be  awarded per year to meet the needs of over 100 cemeteries.  ', H.R. 5487, "", the Veterans Cemetery Grants Improvement Act updates that  authorization by a modest $5 million. The Act will help veteran  cemeteries in every state, territory, and tribal nation, remain the  dignified and well-maintained resting places our veterans deserve.  I know in my own district, the Northern Mariana Islands, the veterans  cemetery, built with federal funds, faces challenges in this respect.  Veterans' families have come to me for help and this bill responds.  I know my co-sponsor, Representative Steil, shares this concern for  the Southern Wisconsin Veterans Memorial Cemetery in his district, as  do other Members for the cemeteries that serve their constituents.  And I know the members of this House are committed to honoring our  nation's veterans and their families, who have sacrificed so much to  ensure our country remains safe and free.  I thank Chairman Takano and Senator Tester for all their support to  include into "", H.R. 7105, ' this important measure.  I ask my colleagues to support ', H.R. 7105, '.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) that the House suspend the rules  and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, ', H.R. 7105, '.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
454,Linda Sanchez,0.4045279622077942,D,sanchez,sanchez," Ms. SANCHEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart. Few men  ever achieve what John Lewis has in his life, and few men do so while  genuinely caring about every single person they meet.  When I joined the Ways and Means Committee as a new member, John made  a point to make me feel welcome.  Despite all that he had accomplished in his life, John was never too  busy or too important for you.  John made such a profound impact on all of us because his kindness,  humility, and gentle strength were rooted in his nature.  He understood that his life's work could never be finished, and he  never missed an opportunity to inspire younger generations to carry  that work forward.  I will never forget when John's inspiration healed deep wounds in my  own community. In 2005, a high school in my district was struggling  with racial tension between Black and Latinx students. Students were  hopelessly divided, and John offered to visit the high school with me.  He spoke to students and their parents and helped them understand  that the civil rights movement benefited all disenfranchised  communities. He reminded us that when minority communities allow  ourselves to be pitted against each other, we all suffer.  As serious as John was, he also had a lighthearted and fun side to  him as well. I will never forget when he made a video of himself  dancing ``Gangnam Style'' to encourage young people to vote. He was up  for anything that promoted voting and civic engagement.  John had a profound impact on my son, Joaquin, when we walked  together in Selma across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Joaquin, who was 7  at the time, was able to walk with John Lewis and retrace the footsteps  of history with a living legend. Joaquin was so moved that he read all  of John's books and wrote a report on him during a unit on African- American history in school.  I will always cherish the memories that my family and I were lucky  enough to share with John.  It is a cruel irony that we should lose John when the qualities that  made him great are needed so desperately today in our government. But  his passing is a heartbreaking reminder of what really matters.  Because of John, we know that ridding our society of injustice  requires [["", Page , H3971, ] all of us to get in good trouble. Because of John, we know we can  withstand true adversity.  History will remember John Lewis as a hero who made the world better  for all. It is worth remembering that he did so by showing and  reminding us all to be better versions of ourselves.  I am so grateful to have called him a friend, a colleague, and a  mentor. My husband and son were here this morning to say good-bye to  Mr. Lewis for the last time. My son thought it was important to see him  off on his journey to walk with angels. We will miss him dearly.    "
455,John Sarbanes,1.3064370155334473,D,sarbanes,sarbanes," Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader for yielding.  I thank you for your friendship with my father, Paul Sarbanes, for so  many years. You go back with him a long way, and he cherished that  friendship, as he did the relationship with all the members of the  Maryland Delegation during the time that he served.  I thank my colleagues here tonight who have come to help remember him  and pay tribute.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my brother, Michael, and my sister, Janet,  I thank [["", Page , H7028, ] all the people who, over the last 48 hours, have been sending in these  remembrances and tributes to my father from his time in the Senate, and  before that, here in the House where he was for 6 years, and for time  periods before that, even.  I want to thank right up front, and in particular, his staff, who  over the course of his 40 years in public service he understood were  the ones that made him or broke him. He was a tough taskmaster, but he  chose people that had that same set of principles and values and  commitment to hard work. A lot of the tributes that have been coming in  have talked about him being a workhorse, not a show horse. The idea  that you put your head down, you get the job done, you try to build  consensus where you can, but you always remember that you are here for  a reason, that is to make good, strong policy that can help people.  He lived a full life, he made a difference in the lives of others,  which is all he ever wanted to do. He knew he wanted to be in politics  from a very early age, but his motivation was in looking at the  opportunities that he had, the son of Greek immigrants who came to this  country with very little, and he had the opportunity for education and  advancement. His motivation was to make those available to others.  He loved being with people. He had a dry sense of humor. He enjoyed  bantering with all who crossed his path, was intensely interested in  the journey that others had taken to whatever station they held in  life. And he was always asking: ``Where are you from?'' ``What do you  do?'' ``What is next for you?''  He had an inherent integrity that was strengthened by always striving  to meet the expectations of those who put their confidence in him.  In politics, he was motivated, as I said, by the burning conviction  that every individual has dignity and the potential to succeed if given  a fair shot, and he was determined others would have those same  opportunities that he had enjoyed.  {time} 1930  He understood that if you share the credit, if you don't seek credit,  you get a lot more done. That was how he operated.  A few years ago, I prevailed upon him to sit for about 20 hours of  videotaped oral history because I wanted to make sure we captured the  essence of his life and his career. So, we have this treasure, which we  will make available to people as we move forward. I wanted, in his own  words, to grab a few excerpts from that, that I think convey who he is  and what he cared about.  I remember I came home one time, and he was sitting in the living  room on the couch, and he was revved up about something. I don't know  what the issue was that day that had gotten him sort of motivated. But  he banged on the side of the couch, and he said: ``I am for the little  guy. I am for the little guy.'' He might as well, in that moment, have  been stating his purpose in public life. That is what motivated him  from the moment he got up in the morning until the moment he went to  bed at night.  I am going to read a couple of these things from his oral history. He  talked about getting public housing, senior citizen affordable housing,  in the Inner Harbor in Baltimore. He was very proud of the fact that  you had this senior citizen housing there.  He said: ``Next door to it is an expensive hotel, and behind the  hotel is a big condominium building with very expensive condominiums in  it. Every time I go by that building, I get a sense of satisfaction out  of it, particularly in the nice weather. I look up, and all of these  seniors are sitting out on their terraces, looking out over the water.  ``I know the developers would give their eyeteeth to get ahold of  that piece of property, but they don't have it. It is part of this  affordable housing initiative, so a lot of seniors who worked hard all  their lives and are now retired but don't have a lot of money have the  benefit of this housing.''  He said: ``I always get a measure of satisfaction out of that.''  We are in the midst, as we know, in our country of some really  challenging moments addressing issues of justice. Here is a story about  how my father, in a small way, made a statement around justice.  He said: ``We had a situation in one of the rural towns on the  Eastern Shore, and when they delivered the mail, the postman, he would  come down the street here, and there would be these big houses, and he  would go up to the house and put the mail in the mailbox. And then as  he moved on down the street, the composition of the neighborhood would  change, and the houses would get smaller, much smaller.  ``The complexion of the people living in the houses changed, too, as  you went down the street, so they went from White to Black. And down  the street, instead of the postman going through the gate or whatever  and up to the house, they were going to require those people to put a  postbox at the street. So, some people came to us about that, a couple  of pastors or ministers, and they pointed out this situation.  ``So, I got the postal people in for a meeting in my office,'' my  father said. ``'Now, what is happening here? As I understand it, up  here with the big houses and the White residents, you are going to  continue to go up to the house and put the mail through the door slot.  But when you get down this way to the little houses and the African- American residents, you are going to require them to put a mail  receptacle out at the pavement or at the curb, and you are not going to  go up to the house anymore. What is the rationale for this policy?'  ``Well, of course, if you lay it out like that, there isn't a  rationale, at least not an acceptable one that can withstand the light  of day. So, they dropped the project and went on delivering the mail.''  Here is what my father said: ``That is the way it ought to work. And  I felt it is not a big issue, but we got some justice done for those  people.''  Small things that stand for big principles, that is what he was  about.  I am going to close with just a couple of final thoughts here. First  of all, I want to thank the Greek-American community, which was  fiercely proud of my father's achievements. He was deeply proud of  where he came from. It was an inspiration to him in public service. I  want to thank so many who helped him along the way from that community.  My mother, Christine, who died 10 years ago, she came into his life  like a bolt of lightning. He didn't know what hit him. He met her at  Oxford, this brilliant, beautiful woman who could match him step for  step in her intellect, and she knocked his socks off.  I think the great regret of his life was that he had hoped in his  retirement--you know, public life is hard. We know that. I think all  along the way, he was looking forward to that time when the two of them  could spend more time together. Unfortunately, she passed away within a  couple of years of his retirement, and they didn't get that opportunity  together. I don't think he ever fully recovered from that.  I think about his legacy, and I understand, certainly, that there is  no way his children--myself; my brother, Michael; and my sister,  Janet--are ever going to match that legacy because it is a pretty  unmatchable one when you look at the record. But I think we are all  doing what we can to continue it, to nurture it, to sustain it going  forward.  Again, I thank you for the time to speak here, and I thank my  colleagues for all of your support and kind words over the last couple  of days.    "
456,Steve Scalise,0.06958094984292984,R,scalise,scalise," Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  As the gentleman from Maryland pointed out, we know government  funding expires at midnight. Clearly, we have been working for days in  a very productive way to get close to an agreement on both funding of  government as well as COVID relief. We are not quite there on all of  these details, but we are eager to see if we can get this resolved.  As the gentleman knows, everybody, Members on both sides are very  interested in finding out what the schedule will be. I appreciate that  update, and I imagine that means we will stay tuned and see if, between  now and 5 p.m., we can get that resolved.    "
457,Janice Schakowsky,1.630041241645813,D,schakowsky,schakowsky," Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I also thank Representative Guthrie, who  cosponsored this legislation with me, and also Chairman Pallone and  Chairman Bobby Rush for their help in moving this bill forward.  This is a bipartisan bill that provides an important fix to an energy  conservation rule for ceiling fans that the Department of Energy  finalized in January 2017.  However, minor technical changes to the rule were needed in order to  prevent a major unintended consequence. Without this bill, some of the  most energy-efficient, large-diameter ceiling fans would have to be  taken off the market in the United States. So we fixed that.  The bill will also provide consistent labeling requirements for  residential ceiling fans and simplify the ENERGY STAR program. Both of  these changes will make it easier for Americans to choose the right  products for their homes. Representative Guthrie and I worked together  with ceiling fan manufacturers, the energy efficiency community, and  other stakeholders to clarify the standard. The Department of Energy  was consulted throughout the drafting process.  What pleases me really the most about this legislation is that it  highlights how we need legislation, big and small, to tackle the  climate crisis.  This bill also highlights how we can work together across the aisle  to enact commonsense policies that directly impact energy usage in  homes and save American families money on their energy bill at the same  time.  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing to work together with my  Republican colleagues in the next Congress.    "
458,Adam Schiff,0.9837734699249268,D,schiff,schiff," Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise to emphasize the appropriate  application and interpretation of Section 404 of the Intelligence  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, which has been included as  Division W of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021.  Section 404 was authored by Chairman Bennie Thompson of the Committee  on Homeland Security. Its essence is to establish a specialized  fellowship program related to cybersecurity and intelligence within the  Department of Homeland Security. The program is meant for certain  undergraduate students from diverse racial, ethnic, cultural, and other  backgrounds. And the Secretary of Homeland Security--who shall  administer Section 404--also will have authority to hire successful  fellowship participants as Department employees, and into positions  involving cyber or intelligence.  The broader and most compelling goal being, of course, to ensure that  the Department and the Federal government are doing their utmost to  recruit, hire and retain a highly diverse workforce. The language of  Section 404 must be interpreted and implemented by the Department  broadly, with a mind towards attainment of this lawful objective; under  no circumstances should it be read in an inappropriately narrow or  needlessly restrictive fashion.  Although Section 404 does not require that students attend  Historically Black Colleges or Universities or Minority-Serving  Institutions in order to participate in the fellowship program, the  Secretary of Homeland Security--who will administer this authority-- should make extensive efforts to promote the fellowship among students  from HBCUs and MSIs.  Together with the other Members of the Homeland Security and  Intelligence Committees, I will look forward to receiving the report  required by Section 404, which will permit Congress to confirm that, in  fact, the Department is conducting the necessary outreach to HBCUs,  MSIs, and other Institutions of Higher Education; and, consistent with  the approach I have set forth here, reading and applying Section 404's  language in a manner that fulfills the initiative's overarching goal.

459,Bradley Schneider,1.4560552835464478,D,schneider,schneider," Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the frontline  heroes, especially our healthcare workers who are working tirelessly  under unbearable stresses to save lives.  I thank the researchers and scientists who are developing COVID  vaccines. But I also want to plead with my fellow citizens to act  responsibly to protect each other in this battle against a deadly  virus.  Today, Moderna announced remarkable results for a second vaccine on  the heels of Pfizer's recent announcement.  There is light at the end of the tunnel, but the tunnel is long, and  the road back is still many months away. We can't afford to let our  guard down or millions of Americans will get sick and thousands, tens  of thousands of our fellow citizens, our neighbors, and our family  members will needlessly die.  As I speak, America's hospitals, especially in rural and underserved  communities, are at capacity. They are airlifting patients to bigger  cities. We have reports of growing shortfalls of medical supplies and  staff. Our frontline healthcare workers desperately need our help.  As we enter the holiday season, I am begging Americans to stay  vigilant. Wear a mask, watch your distance, and wash your hands. If you  must gather, do so outside, even though it is cold. I know that you  want to see your families. I want to see mine. I know that the  sacrifice will not be easy, but I also know that there is pain.  We can do this. We can beat back this virus, but only if we do it  together. If we don't people will die, and God forbid you or your loved  one is the last to die before a vaccine.    "
460,Kurt Schrader,0.7918952703475952,D,schrader,schrader," Mr. SCHRADER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak against the CASH  Act. This is an ineffective and poorly targeted approach to aiding  Americans in distress. It is clearly a last-minute political maneuver  by the President and extremists on both sides of the political spectrum  who have been largely absent during months of very hard negotiations.  They have chosen to tweet their opinions instead of coming to the table  to get aid in the hands of Americans and small businesses who need it  most.  Over the last 6 months, and especially in the last few weeks as the  holidays loomed and COVID cases skyrocketed, the Problem Solvers Caucus  worked with Senators on both sides of the aisle and House and Senate  leadership to craft legislation that includes vetted programs like the  PPP and unemployment compensation that have been improved upon since  the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.  I feel for all of those who are suffering today due to financial  hardship and look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on a  bipartisan, bicameral basis to continue to find ways to help provide  relief.  People who are making six-figure incomes who have not been impacted  by COVID-19 do not need checks. We have had 9 months to fix this  program to get aid to the people who need it most. That has not  happened. Let's reverse course and target those in need.    "
461,Kim Schrier,0.6795381307601929,D,schrier,schrier," Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, the people in my district continue to  struggle with the economic effects of COVID-19. My constituents and  small business owners will be so relieved to know that help that they  need is one step closer to being here, including more assistance to  small businesses, funding for childcare and education, enhanced  unemployment benefits, and rental assistance.  Several of my bills to help children and families have been included  in this package as well, including increasing funding for child abuse  prevention and more help fighting hunger and boosting access to fresh  fruits and vegetables.  Finally, as a doctor, I am very happy that my legislation to improve  education about vaccines, including a future or many future COVID-19  vaccines, is in this package. It is important that the American people  feel confident that whatever vaccine does get approval, it is truly  safe and effective, and that education begins now.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    "
462,David Schweikert,0.12922176718711853,R,schweikert,schweikert," Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Lipinski, being someone from the other side, you  really are one of the good guys. I have had a handful of great  conversations with you over the years. Even though I am a conservative  from the desert, you have always been very kind to me, and your concern  and love for your community have always shone through, so it is  appreciated.  Mr. Speaker, this is one of those opportunities where you have the  feeling you are going to be doing this a lot over this next year.  Mr. Speaker, I want to make an argument that growth is moral, and I  want to go a bit further than that. One of the things that spurred me  to come here is I listened to Janet Yellen just a couple of days ago,  who may be becoming Secretary of the Treasury, give a [["", Page , H7039, ] speech. In that speech, there were wonderful words about caring about  working men and women, helping the working poor, but there was a  complete failure in that discussion to talk about where we have had  success.  Look, so many people in this body run around saying, well, you are  conservative, you are liberal, but we care about the hardworking  taxpayers of America. We want to see our brothers and sisters in the  country, particularly those who--and I hate this term, and it is one of  the hazards as a Republican. We often sound like accountants on  steroids. You know, we will go and say, well, our brothers and sisters  who are in the lower income quartiles--and no one knows what a quartile  is.  But the point, we claim we care. We claim we want to do things. I  want to claim we have the proof that, in 2018 and 2019, there was a  miracle happening in this country.  For the first time in modern economic history of the United States,  the thing particularly the left used to scream at Republicans, because  they cared so much about income inequality, I am going to make the  argument we delivered policy, that, for the first time, income  inequality began to shrink, 2 years where it worked.  As the demagoguery, which is the modern political scene, as we hear  people like the Janet Yellens of the world, who I have had a great  working relationship with over the years, read their script and don't  take a moment to say what worked in just the last couple of years, what  worked to help so many of our American citizens have opportunity, to  see a light at the end of the tunnel, to stop seeing the purchasing  power of their lives, their ability to plan for retirement, the ability  to take care of their families and their kids.  Even outside the political rage that drives this body so often, could  we take a moment and understand America was doing something it had not  been able to do for decades and decades and decades, where the income  inequality, the movement of wages, the value of someone's labor, had  been being crushed decade after decade? In 2018 and 2019, the data is  absolutely solid and clear: There was an economic miracle happening in  this country.  If you care about the working poor, take a look at what happened, and  let's do more of it. Those things that weren't working in the previous  years, let's do less of it. The problem is, in this environment, that  becomes partisan.  Let's walk through some of the facts. This is my moment to get a  little snarky at my colleagues from the other side and some of their  comments they have made. Those of us on our side are looking for our  apology because they didn't tell the truth. They projected the future.  This is when Speaker Pelosi then was the minority leader. She,  basically, when we did the tax reform, after calling it a scam and  then, in her quote, saying making the rich richer, except that is not  what happened. The math is the math is the math. I know it doesn't fit  the political rhetoric of this place, but the math is the math.  If you take a look at the highest income quartiles, their percentage  of the income, the wealth actually went down in 2018 and 2019,  something that had not happened in modern economic history.  You would have thought the Democrats would say, hey, we got it wrong,  but we really care a lot about this, because they claim they care a lot  about it. So why don't we look at some of the other reality.  My colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee on the other side, the  House Democrats, kept doing speeches. I just snipped one of the quotes:  You know, the one-time bonuses are nice, but what American workers  really deserve are permanent wage increases. The true beneficiaries of  the Republican tax bills are shareholders and top corporate executives,  not the middle class.  It turns out they were absolutely wrong. And the math is the math is   the math. The facts are the facts. If you look at the   population--and we even broke this down--you could see   wage increases for African Americans were the fastest   movement growth in modern times. When I say modern times,   I mean like the last 50 years. Hispanics outpaced Anglo   workers rather dramatically.  Do you think those of us on the Republican side are ever going to get  an apology for them making up things?  Why don't we go on and just make it for gender? It turns out that  2018 and 2019, movement in wage growth was miraculous. There should  have been joy in this body if you care about the working poor. It turns  out that wage growth for females, particularly females who didn't have  a high school education, was remarkable.  I believe in the ending part of 2018, when they did the calculation  here, it was over 7 percent wage growth because their labor had value.  We lived in a society that actually had more jobs than people.  I will argue that has to be all of our goal. People's work, their  labor, became valuable. I desperately hope we start to focus on how we  get back to that.  I know some of these charts are hard to read. We will put them up on  our website. And I want to compliment the team over at the Joint  Economic Committee for helping me do this. But this one and the next  one are important because it is a simple fact that the rhetoric after  tax reform from the left, they made things up. By doing that, they hurt  so many Americans.  If we had been honest about the facts--it would be intellectually  honest if my colleagues on the other side would step up and say, okay,  yeah, it is really, really helping the working poor. It is really  helping the working Americans. But we think we can do it better.  That would be honest. God bless them, that would be honest. But to  say it was hurting them was a lie.  Here is a simple example. 2017, before tax reform, if we--we always  compare and talk about the top quartile, the top 1 percent of income  earners. They were controlling, I think, slightly over 20 percent, 21  percent, of all the income in the country, and they were paying about  38.5 percent of all the Federal income taxes.  What happened after tax reform? How many times did we hear from the  left, from the leftwing echo chamber, from the media, that, well, this  was tax cuts for the rich? Well, a year later, when there was tax  reform, 2018, the top 1 percent were no longer paying 38.5 percent of  the Federal income taxes. Now, they are paying over 40 percent of the  Federal income taxes, but yet their control of the wage, of the wealth,  income wealth, actually went down.  But what was more important--and this is my failing--we don't talk  enough about it. We will call it the bottom 50 percent of our brothers  and sisters that we claim we represent, that we claim, when we get  behind these microphones, we care about. There, the bottom 50 percent,  their tax burden actually decreased, but the percentage of the wages  went up.  This is only 2018. The 2019 numbers haven't been vetted because they  are still not all in yet. Our understanding is, preliminarily, the  curve even steepens. The fact of the matter is, there was an economic  miracle happening in 2018 and 2019. If you care about people, we need  to figure out what we were doing right and go back and do more of it.  Another way to basically say the same thing, this is--and forgive me  if I mispronounce the name. Is it Ms. Tanden who may become the OMB  Director? She is the potential OMB nominee. She said some incredibly  partisan things that were wrong. The lift-out quote here is: Because  they practice class warfare against us.  Well, actually, no. It is just the opposite. If you look at the math,  the top 10 percent under the old tax system were paying less of the  Federal tax burden than they did after tax reform. Our brothers and  sisters, the other 90 percent of the income-earners in this country,  were paying less of the Federal tax burden after tax reform. The math  is the math. But the rhetoric is toxic and didn't tell the truth. Once  again, then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi: Widening the income  inequality gap.  Except the fact is, the Republican tax reform along with some of the  other policies that came about in 2018 and 2019 were the first time in  modern economic history where income inequality actually shrank.  I always thought that was the holy grail here, that the rich keep  getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer--except after tax  reform, except after some of the regulatory reform. [["", Page , H7040, ]  If you care about working men and women in this country, if you care  about the working poor, you have a template that is only a year in the  past where it was working.  Let's figure out what we were doing right, and, Mr. Speaker, let's go  back and do more of it. The one thing I will beg of this body, as the  Democrats look like they will continue to be in the majority, and they  have spent a couple of years demagoguing our previous work as  Republicans when we did the tax reform, when we did, the economic  opportunity that it brought: Stop making up the numbers. Tell the  truth.  Let's hold hands--well, in the COVID world, we will talk at an  appropriate 6-foot distance. If our rhetoric is we care, we have  delivered tax reform in a fashion where it worked.  {time} 2130  It created an economic, in many ways, to quote Chairman Powell of the  Federal Reserve, a Goldilocks economy.  I hope it is every Member of Congress' goal here. Let's get back to  that Goldilocks economy that was helping so many of our poor, so many  of our working poor, so many of our working class, and actually, as you  can see in the data, was closing income inequality.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "

Mr. President, Judge Anuraag Singhal has  honorably served the State of Florida for several years, and I proudly  support his confirmation as a district judge for the Southern District  of Florida today. He has built a distinguished legal career, serving as  a criminal prosecutor for Florida's Seventeenth Judicial Circuit and  later opening a private practice focused on criminal defense and  appellate work. Throughout his career, he has demonstrated a firm  commitment to the rule of law, and as Governor of Florida, I had the  distinct honor to appoint Judge Singhal to Florida's Seventeenth  Judicial Circuit court in 2011. I am equally honored to support his  confirmation to the United States District Court for the Southern  District of Florida today and know he will continue to serve our State  and Nation well.    "

Mr. President, today I would like to take a moment to recognize Ms. Nancy Whitworth of Greenville, SC, for her over 40 years of service to Greenville County. I extend my congratulations to her on her upcoming retirement and wish to reflect on her successful career. As the longtime economic developer and deputy city manager for the city of Greenville, Nancy was responsible for commercial and neighborhood revitalization, downtown development, business recruitment and retention, planning and zoning, and building codes. She has also authored articles on Greenville's award-winning downtown and meets frequently with other cities to share Greenville's success story. Last year, she was awarded with the 2018 Local Economic Developer of the Year award. Ms. Whitworth is to be commended for her role in spurring the dramatic growth and revitalization Greenville [[<a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7026"">Page S7026</a>]] has seen in the past decades. Through her leadership and dedication to her community, she has been an invaluable asset to the Upstate of South Carolina. Ms. Whitworth is a shining example of a dedicated public servant and should inspire us all to give our best to our communities. I would like to personally commend and thank Ms. Whitworth for her decades of service that encouraged Greenville's economic prosperity and success.<bullet>   "
465,Austin Scott,0.2713993191719055,R,scott,scott," Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, as a member of U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my honor to recognize a unique small business for its tremendous contributions to the local economy. Small businesses drive our Nation's economic expansion, generate lasting job growth, and encourage community development. This week, it is my honor to recognize Boyd Cycling of Greenville, SC, as the Senate Small Business of the Week. Boyd Johnson, a former competitive cyclist, originally founded Boyd Cycling under the name Boyd Bikes in September of 2009. Charged by a mission of quality and service, Boyd set out to produce and sell various bike products in the Greenville area. About 3 months into the operation, Boyd's Bikes began to grow dramatically, and Boyd's wife Nicole joined as a partner of the business. Boyd and Nicole are a prime example of how a leap of faith, coupled with hard work, can pay off. Boyd Bikes initially offered wheels, bike frames, handlebars, and other accessories, but the Johnsons quickly realized that their competitive advantage was their handcrafted wheels made out of carbon fiber and alloy. By 2011, Boyd and Nicole decided to focus directly on specializing in bike wheels and changed the name of the business to Boyd Cycling. In addition to focusing on bike wheels, Boyd and Nicole decided to shake up their business model. Originally, Boyd Cycling focused primarily on direct-to-consumer sales. Wanting to expand their business, Boyd and Nicole reached out to the Spartanburg Area Small Business Development Center, SBDC, a resource partner of the U.S. Small Business Administration, and received business counseling and exporting advice. Eventually, Boyd Cycling began selling their products to bike shops around the country in addition to their own website. By staying committed to high quality and low pricing, the Johnsons have been able to avoid undercutting their retail clients while diversifying their income stream. In turn, this has enabled them to export their products globally and now currently distribute to over 15 countries. A seasoned cyclist, Boyd spends time carefully designing each product the company offers. Once a product is developed, Boyd Cycling contracts manufacturing out to different firms domestically and internationally. Boyd maintains rigorous standards when contracting with every manufacturing firm that the company uses, making sure to implement quality controls on materials and construction methods. Boyd Cycling's dedication to quality has not gone unnoticed. They have received national media coverage, excellent customer reviews, and numerous awards. In 2017 and 2019, Boyd and Nicole were named the U.S. Small Business Administration's Exporter of the Year for South Carolina. This award recognizes small business owners for their success and commitment to exporting goods or services. Boyd Cycling also supports various philanthropies in their community including Meals on Wheels, the Alzheimers Foundation, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Miracle Hill, Upstate Forever, and Global Bike. Their community involvement has been a key to their success as Greenville has become a bustling hub for the recreational biking community. Boyd and Nicole truly embody the entrepreneurial and community spirit. From its humble beginnings, Boyd has grown into a respectable player in the industry while maintaining a commitment to customer service and product [[<a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S3283"">Page S3283</a>]] quality. I am honored to recognize the Johnsons and the entire team at Boyd Cycling as the Senate Small Business of the Week. You make South Carolina proud, and I look forward to watching your continued growth and success.<bullet>   "
466,Austin Scott,0.2713993191719055,R,scott,scott," Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, The House amendment to the Senate  amendment to ', H.R. 133, ', the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021,  includes many important provisions. Among them is Section 203 of Title  II, Division BB, based on ', H.R. 7539, "", the Strengthening Behavioral  Health Parity Act--an important step forward in improving the effective  enforcement of mental health parity laws that govern group and  individual health plans and coverage. I am pleased to see this  legislation advance as part of our continuing efforts to ensure the  promise of parity is realized for all.  As Chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor, which has  legislative jurisdiction over employee health benefit plans (including  provisions of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act and the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act or ERISA) as well as oversight  jurisdiction over the United States Department of Labor, I would like  to provide additional clarification for the record regarding the  interactions between this legislation and existing enforcement and  compliance efforts by the Secretary of Labor.  First, no provision of Section 203 in any way restricts, alters, or  otherwise interferes with the existing enforcement and oversight  authority of the Secretary of Labor, including the Secretary's  authority to investigate, audit, and seek equitable or other relief to  enforce any requirements of federal law. The requirement that the  Secretary examine the comparative analyses of at least 20 plans  annually serves as a floor, not a ceiling, on the Department's  enforcement actions, and the Department remains authorized to continue  to utilize its broad authority under Sections 502, 504, 506 of ERISA  and other laws to enforce all requirements of this bill, Part 7 of  ERISA, and any other requirements of federal law.  Second, no provision of Section 203 in any way restricts, alters, or  otherwise interferes with the rights of group health plan participants  to bring an action to enforce their rights under Section 502 of ERISA,  nor does it impact judicial review of any statutory violations. This  bill also should not be interpreted to create any additional  presumption in favor of health plans and issuers during judicial review  of nonquantitative treatment limitation (NQTL) determinations, and the  Secretary remains authorized to seek equitable or other relief,  including relief regarding the re-adjudication of claims. All  provisions should be interpreted to ensure the broadest access to  relief for plan participants.  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of the 900 billion dollar economic relief package which has been agreed  to by Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. While this  package is far from what is actually needed, it is necessary to act  right now and we do not have any additional time to wait. This bill  will direct billions of dollars in aid to unemployed individuals who  are suffering with no other hope or help in sight.  It will provide up to $600 in stimulus checks, it will extend  unemployment benefit checks, extend a moratorium on evictions for 1  month, 325 billion for business relief with 275 billion going to  paycheck protection, 82 billion for schools, 20 billion for vaccine  distribution. While this is not quite exactly what I was looking for,  it will hold us until President Biden takes the reins and leads us on.    "

Boyd Cycling's dedication to quality has not gone unnoticed. They have received national media coverage, excellent customer reviews, and numerous awards. In 2017 and 2019, Boyd and Nicole were named the U.S. Small Business Administration's Exporter of the Year for South Carolina. This award recognizes small business owners for their success and commitment to exporting goods or services. Boyd Cycling also supports various philanthropies in their community including Meals on Wheels, the Alzheimers Foundation, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Miracle Hill, Upstate Forever, and Global Bike. Their community involvement has been a key to their success as Greenville has become a bustling hub for the recreational biking community. Boyd and Nicole truly embody the entrepreneurial and community spirit.

470,Bobby Scott,2.4732580184936523,D,scott,scott," Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, The House amendment to the Senate  amendment to ', H.R. 133, ', the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021,  includes many important provisions. Among them is Section 203 of Title  II, Division BB, based on ', H.R. 7539, "", the Strengthening Behavioral  Health Parity Act--an important step forward in improving the effective  enforcement of mental health parity laws that govern group and  individual health plans and coverage. I am pleased to see this  legislation advance as part of our continuing efforts to ensure the  promise of parity is realized for all.  As Chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor, which has  legislative jurisdiction over employee health benefit plans (including  provisions of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act and the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act or ERISA) as well as oversight  jurisdiction over the United States Department of Labor, I would like  to provide additional clarification for the record regarding the  interactions between this legislation and existing enforcement and  compliance efforts by the Secretary of Labor.  First, no provision of Section 203 in any way restricts, alters, or  otherwise interferes with the existing enforcement and oversight  authority of the Secretary of Labor, including the Secretary's  authority to investigate, audit, and seek equitable or other relief to  enforce any requirements of federal law. The requirement that the  Secretary examine the comparative analyses of at least 20 plans  annually serves as a floor, not a ceiling, on the Department's  enforcement actions, and the Department remains authorized to continue  to utilize its broad authority under Sections 502, 504, 506 of ERISA  and other laws to enforce all requirements of this bill, Part 7 of  ERISA, and any other requirements of federal law.  Second, no provision of Section 203 in any way restricts, alters, or  otherwise interferes with the rights of group health plan participants  to bring an action to enforce their rights under Section 502 of ERISA,  nor does it impact judicial review of any statutory violations. This  bill also should not be interpreted to create any additional  presumption in favor of health plans and issuers during judicial review  of nonquantitative treatment limitation (NQTL) determinations, and the  Secretary remains authorized to seek equitable or other relief,  including relief regarding the re-adjudication of claims. All  provisions should be interpreted to ensure the broadest access to  relief for plan participants.  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of the 900 billion dollar economic relief package which has been agreed  to by Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. While this  package is far from what is actually needed, it is necessary to act  right now and we do not have any additional time to wait. This bill  will direct billions of dollars in aid to unemployed individuals who  are suffering with no other hope or help in sight.  It will provide up to $600 in stimulus checks, it will extend  unemployment benefit checks, extend a moratorium on evictions for 1  month, 325 billion for business relief with 275 billion going to  paycheck protection, 82 billion for schools, 20 billion for vaccine  distribution. While this is not quite exactly what I was looking for,  it will hold us until President Biden takes the reins and leads us on.    "
471,David Scott,0.7069361805915833,D,scott,scott," Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, Judge Anuraag Singhal has  honorably served the State of Florida for several years, and I proudly  support his confirmation as a district judge for the Southern District  of Florida today. He has built a distinguished legal career, serving as  a criminal prosecutor for Florida's Seventeenth Judicial Circuit and  later opening a private practice focused on criminal defense and  appellate work. Throughout his career, he has demonstrated a firm  commitment to the rule of law, and as Governor of Florida, I had the  distinct honor to appoint Judge Singhal to Florida's Seventeenth  Judicial Circuit court in 2011. I am equally honored to support his  confirmation to the United States District Court for the Southern  District of Florida today and know he will continue to serve our State  and Nation well.    "
472,David Scott,0.7069361805915833,D,scott,scott," Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. President, today I would like to take a moment to recognize Ms. Nancy Whitworth of Greenville, SC, for her over 40 years of service to Greenville County. I extend my congratulations to her on her upcoming retirement and wish to reflect on her successful career. As the longtime economic developer and deputy city manager for the city of Greenville, Nancy was responsible for commercial and neighborhood revitalization, downtown development, business recruitment and retention, planning and zoning, and building codes. She has also authored articles on Greenville's award-winning downtown and meets frequently with other cities to share Greenville's success story. Last year, she was awarded with the 2018 Local Economic Developer of the Year award. Ms. Whitworth is to be commended for her role in spurring the dramatic growth and revitalization Greenville [[<a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7026"">Page S7026</a>]] has seen in the past decades. Through her leadership and dedication to her community, she has been an invaluable asset to the Upstate of South Carolina. Ms. Whitworth is a shining example of a dedicated public servant and should inspire us all to give our best to our communities. I would like to personally commend and thank Ms. Whitworth for her decades of service that encouraged Greenville's economic prosperity and success.<bullet>   "
473,David Scott,0.7069361805915833,D,scott,scott," Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, as a member of U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my honor to recognize a unique small business for its tremendous contributions to the local economy. Small businesses drive our Nation's economic expansion, generate lasting job growth, and encourage community development. This week, it is my honor to recognize Boyd Cycling of Greenville, SC, as the Senate Small Business of the Week. Boyd Johnson, a former competitive cyclist, originally founded Boyd Cycling under the name Boyd Bikes in September of 2009. Charged by a mission of quality and service, Boyd set out to produce and sell various bike products in the Greenville area. About 3 months into the operation, Boyd's Bikes began to grow dramatically, and Boyd's wife Nicole joined as a partner of the business. Boyd and Nicole are a prime example of how a leap of faith, coupled with hard work, can pay off. Boyd Bikes initially offered wheels, bike frames, handlebars, and other accessories, but the Johnsons quickly realized that their competitive advantage was their handcrafted wheels made out of carbon fiber and alloy. By 2011, Boyd and Nicole decided to focus directly on specializing in bike wheels and changed the name of the business to Boyd Cycling. In addition to focusing on bike wheels, Boyd and Nicole decided to shake up their business model. Originally, Boyd Cycling focused primarily on direct-to-consumer sales. Wanting to expand their business, Boyd and Nicole reached out to the Spartanburg Area Small Business Development Center, SBDC, a resource partner of the U.S. Small Business Administration, and received business counseling and exporting advice. Eventually, Boyd Cycling began selling their products to bike shops around the country in addition to their own website. By staying committed to high quality and low pricing, the Johnsons have been able to avoid undercutting their retail clients while diversifying their income stream. In turn, this has enabled them to export their products globally and now currently distribute to over 15 countries. A seasoned cyclist, Boyd spends time carefully designing each product the company offers. Once a product is developed, Boyd Cycling contracts manufacturing out to different firms domestically and internationally. Boyd maintains rigorous standards when contracting with every manufacturing firm that the company uses, making sure to implement quality controls on materials and construction methods. Boyd Cycling's dedication to quality has not gone unnoticed. They have received national media coverage, excellent customer reviews, and numerous awards. In 2017 and 2019, Boyd and Nicole were named the U.S. Small Business Administration's Exporter of the Year for South Carolina.

475,F. Sensenbrenner,0.16898231208324432,R,sensenbrenner,sensenbrenner," Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the  No BAN Act.  This bill is being framed as a ``religious freedom'' initiative. I  have fought for religious freedom throughout my career. I know what  religious freedom means. This bill is not about religious freedom. It  is about scoring cheap political points against President Trump.  The President is granted broad authority to take quick action to  limit the entry of foreign nationals into the United States. This is  needed for a variety of reasons, including national security and public  health. Whether it is addressing shortcomings in a certain country's  vetting and information sharing or limiting the potential influx of  coronavirus cases, we entrust the Executive Branch to keep America  safe.  President Trump's actions have been mislabeled as a ``Muslim Ban.''  But that is not the case. There is no religious test anywhere in the  President's travel restrictions. North Korea, an essentially religious- less society, is one of the countries included. Myanmar, another  country affected, is more than 80 percent Buddhist. Indonesia, which  was not included in the covered travel restrictions, has the largest  percentage of the world's Muslim population at over 12 percent.  Rather than try to paint with a broad brush, we should look at the  causes of these travel restrictions. Eritrea--Does not comply with the  established identity-management and information-sharing criteria.  Kyrgyzstan--Does not comply with the established identity-management  and information-sharing criteria. Nigeria--Does not comply with the  established identity-management and information-sharing criteria. And  so on.  This isn't about religious freedom. It is only about convincing  people it is.  In addition to the deficiencies of the underlying policy, the  Majority has made a mistake in including the Senate version of  pharmaceutical legislation as its pay-for.  Last year, the House Judiciary Committee worked on a bipartisan basis  to advance two important bills. One to reduce the burdens of patent  litigation when a company seeks to bring a complicated biosimilar drug  to market. And another to create a new antitrust authority to prevent  companies from playing games that could artificially suppress generic  competition.  Chairmen Jerrold Nadler and David Cicilline were great partners to me  and then-Hanking Member Doug Collins in that effort. It was refreshing  during a time of increasingly partisan hostility to work together in a  thoughtful manner to address drug pricing in the country.  Unfortunately, rather than take up that bill, the Majority has simply  ignored our weeks of careful negotiation and has chosen instead to  blindly attach the Senate language.  The shortcomings of this version of the legislation were already  addressed in committee. The text included in the No BAN Act gives the  FTC the authority to find a company liable even if all they do is  introduce an improved version of a product and then make truthful and  non-misleading statements about the new product. This will undoubtedly  stifle innovation. Why would any company invest the necessary research  dollars to introduce a new product, if they can be held liable for  truthful marketing of that product? In Committee, we fixed that.  The bill we're voting on today is also out of step with current  antitrust law. It would completely change the remedy and enforcement  authority under traditional antitrust law, and for no obvious reason,  apply those changes exclusively to just one industry. In Committee, we  fixed that.  I find it troubling that the Majority is choosing to abandon the good  faith negotiations and bipartisan work. The gentlemen from New York and  Rhode Island worked with the Minority to come up with a good product  that addresses drug pricing through regular order. The committee  process works. We should be voting on the legislation that passed the  Judiciary Committee by a voice vote. Not this version.  I oppose this legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.  Pursuant to "", House Resolution 891, ', the previous question is ordered on  this portion of the divided question.  The question is: Will the House concur in the Senate amendment with  the House amendment specified in section 4(a) of ', House Resolution 891, '?  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    "
476,Jose Serrano,1.935861349105835,D,serrano,serrano," Mr. SERRANO. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of ', H.R. 2420, "",  the National Museum of the American Latino Act. This legislation would  establish a National Museum of the American Latino within the  Smithsonian Institution on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.  dedicated to celebrating the significant historical, cultural, and  artistic contributions of Latinos in the United States.  With a population of more than 60 million, Latinos are the largest  minority ethnic group in the United States and the territories. They  have accounted for nearly half of the Nation's population growth since  2010. However, Latinos continue facing systemic underrepresentation in  the halls of Congress, Hollywood, academia, corporate America, and  nearly every aspect of American life. This disparity also exists within  our nation's cultural institutions, including the Smithsonian.  We must not forget that Latinos were here before the founding of our  country. They have fought in every American war since the Revolution.  They have also been at the forefront of every historical moment that  has helped shape our way of life, from the fight for labor rights to  the fight for gay rights. These stories are nearly absent from our  textbooks and classrooms, but they are essential to learning who we are  as a Nation. Simply put, Latino history is American history.  It has been 26 years since the Smithsonian acknowledged its own lack  of Latino representation with their 1994 report, Willful Neglect.  It has been 17 years since former Representatives Xavier Becerra of  California and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida introduced the first bill  to create a commission to study the potential creation of a Latino  Museum and 12 years since it became law.  It has been more than eight years since the 23-member National Museum  of the American Latino Commission presented a detailed plan to  President Barack Obama and the U.S. Congress laying out the blueprint  to get us there.  We cannot wait any longer. It is time for Congress to act.  Latinos deserve a dedicated space in the heart of Washington, D.C.  where our experiences can be shared with the world. Today, we finally  begin the process of setting that plan into motion.  I am proud to have led this effort in the House of Representatives  during the 116th Congress and my final term in office, along with my  colleague Will Hurd of Texas. This was a true team effort.  I also want to thank my colleagues from California, Tony Cardenas and  Pete Aguilar, for their tremendous efforts. From building record  support with 295 bipartisan cosponsors to leading today's debate on the  House floor.  I want to thank Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairman Joaquin Castro  and all my colleagues with the CHC for their steadfast support of this  project from the very beginning.  I want to thank Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raul Grijalva,  Ranking Member Don Young, and Subcommittee Chair Deb Haaland for their  leadership in holding the first legislative hearing on the bill last  October.  I want to thank House Administration Chairperson Zoe Lofgren and  Ranking Member Rodney Davis for favorably reporting the bill out of  committee.  Finally, I would especially like to thank Speaker Nancy Pelosi and  Majority Leader Steny Hoyer for their commitment in bringing this bill  before the full House of Representatives for a vote today.  I urge my colleagues to support "", H.R. 2420, ' and help get us one step  closer to turning this dream into a reality.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Aguilar) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, ', H.R. 2420, ', as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

478,Terri Sewell,1.9721357822418213,D,sewell,sewell," Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Blumenauer for  yielding me the time.  I rise today in support of "", H.R. 991, ', my legislation to reauthorize  the Caribbean Basin Trade Promotion Act.  Madam Speaker, I thank my Republican colleague, Brad Wenstrup, for  his leadership on this bill. I also want to thank Chairman Neal and  Ranking Member Brady for all of their help.  Madam Speaker, I especially want to acknowledge my chairman of the  Subcommittee on Trade, Mr. Blumenauer, for hosting a very meaningful  hearing on the Caribbean Basin Trade Promotion Agreement and its  importance of being reauthorized by September 30 of this year.  For two decades, the Caribbean Basin Trade Promotion Agreement has  been a critical tool to expand our diplomatic and economic relationship  with countries throughout the Caribbean Basin region. This agreement  has allowed for duty- and quota-free treatment of products made with  U.S. goods.  The liberalization of our trade relationship with these countries has  strengthened Western Hemisphere supply chains, while providing economic  development and job creation in the region.  In 2018, United States exports to CBI countries totalled $13.4  billion, while imports totaled $6 billion, creating a $7.4 billion  goods trade surplus for the United States.  One of those Caribbean Basin countries, Haiti, has had tremendous  economic benefits by the Caribbean Basin Trade Promotion Act. The  economic benefits of the CBTPA are essential, with over 90 percent of  their nearly $1 billion in exports entering the United States with the  CBTPA or HOPE duty-free treatment. Moreover, the Association of Haitian  Industries has estimated that the CBTPA, along with the HOPE and HELP  programs, has created over 50,000 jobs in Haiti, alone.  The reauthorization of this program ahead of the September 30  deadline will allow us to continue to strengthen the foundation for  long-term economic stability, while contributing to our diplomatic and  security interests.  Continued economic development in the region is a goal that we should  all share, and the passage of this legislation will reaffirm the  commitment of the United States to this objective. [[', Page , H4656, ]  The importance of our diplomatic and economic ties with the Caribbean  Basin countries is highlighted by the strong support for this  legislation that we receive from the Congressional Black Caucus.  In a letter of support for ', H.R. 991, "" to congressional leadership, the  CBC aptly pointed out: Millions of Americans have Caribbean ancestry  and make up important segments of the United States population. Haiti  is the first Black republic, influencing the rise of abolitionist and  anticolonial movements all across the world, especially in the United  States.  The history and the future for millions of Americans is directly tied  to the economic prosperity of Caribbean Basin countries, and our  relationship must reflect this reality.  Within this context, we also must continue to push our trading  partners for compliance with key eligibility criteria under the  agreement, including upholding the rights of workers and combating  corruption. A lapse in this agreement would jeopardize the economic and  social well-being of workers in the region.  Today's step forward to reauthorize this very important trade  promotion program will allow for continued cooperation and enforcement  on these critical issues. I look forward to remaining engaged with all  of the stakeholders to support these goals, including expanding human  rights and economic prosperity for all.  Madam Speaker, I want to thank the Ambassador of Haiti, Ambassador  Denis, who testified before the subcommittee, for his eloquence on the  importance of the Caribbean Basin Trade Promotion Agreement for Haiti,  in particular.  Madam Speaker, I also want to thank all of the representatives from  the eight Caribbean Basin countries that have come to my office and  talked to us ad nauseam about how important it is that we extend the  Caribbean Basin reauthorization.  As well, Madam Speaker, I would like to also thank Charlie Rangel,  who was the member of the House Ways and Means Committee who really  championed this initially, two decades ago. When I took Charlie's  position on the Ways and Means Committee, he sat me down and told me  how important it was that we not only reauthorize, but we strengthen  the Caribbean Basin Trade Promotion Agreement.  So this is an important step in reauthorizing this very important  trade agreement before its September 30 deadline.  Madam Speaker, I again want to say how proud I am that this agreement  has huge bipartisan support. The reauthorization of this program would  not be possible if it had not been for the bipartisan support that my  colleague from Ohio, Congressman Wenstrup, has so ably provided, a  partnership in this agreement.  While debate over U.S. trade policy is often rigorous, the  reauthorization of the Caribbean Basin Trade Promotion Agreement should  be something that we can all support.  Madam Speaker, I am proud that this important issue is before us for  a vote, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this very  important legislation.  Again, Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Blumenauer for  allowing me to speak on this very important measure.  {time} 1145    "
479,Donna Shalala,0.44789937138557434,D,shalala,shalala," Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.  The previous question was ordered.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on adoption of the  resolution.  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    "
480,Brad Sherman,1.7466120719909668,D,sherman,sherman," Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I will read it so that it is before the  entire House.  ``It is the intent of this legislation to provide the Securities and  Exchange Commission with the discretion necessary to determine how much  of a company's total audit must be performed by a firm beyond the reach  of PCAOB inspections before trading in the company's securities is  prohibited by the Commission. Consistent with our work with the  Securities and Exchange Commission on this legislation, it is our  expectation that the Commission will not prohibit trading in the  securities of companies under this act, as long as not more than one- third of a company's total audit is performed by a firm beyond the  reach of the PCAOB inspections. This legislation provides the  Commission with the authority to determine how an audit would be  measured, whether that be total revenue, assets, or another metric.  ``Furthermore, the scope of this legislation is not intended to be  limited to public companies which rely on foreign audit firms that have  some form of ownership relationship with a PCAOB-registered public  accounting firm. Specifically, it is intended to also encompass public  companies which rely on foreign audit firms that are affiliated with or  maintain some form of affiliation agreement with a PCAOB-registered  public accounting firm.''  Mr. Speaker, one particular comment to draw your attention to is that  it is not the intention of this bill to cover firms that have some  small part of their audit being done in China, perhaps one subsidiary  in China, but is rather designed to apply when a third or more of the  audit is not subject to PCAOB inspection. And how you define one-third  of the audit, whether that is the audit of one-third of the revenues or  one-third of the assets, or some other metric, is left to the SEC.  As House sponsor of this legislation, I have cosigned the statement I  have just read, prepared by Senator Kennedy, but would have the  following additional remarks:  I will take this opportunity to make clear, it is not the intention  of this legislation that every public company, which is a client of an  audit firm with a branch, office, or affiliate in a jurisdiction beyond  the reach of the PCAOB inspections, be subject to a trading  prohibition.  Instead, the trading prohibitions required under this bill are  intended to be applied when a significant portion of the audit is  prepared by an audit firm or the branch, or office, or affiliate of an  audit firm which the PCAOB is unable to inspect, and the SEC has the  authority to interpret this provision.  As chair of the Investor Protection and Capital Markets Subcommittee,  I appreciate how critical it is for investors on U.S. stock exchanges  to have the additional protection that the financial statements have  not just been audited, but that that audit is subject to review by the  PCAOB.  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues for their support of this  legislation, and look forward to its passage here today.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me enough time to  both describe the major parts of the legislation and also make it clear  to the regulators what expectations the House and Senate have for the  regulations that they will issue.    "
481,Mikie Sherrill,0.6107538938522339,D,sherrill,sherrill," Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, it has been more than 250 days since we  passed the CARES Act, and it is past time that we pass a second round.  When this pandemic hit, despite being in one of the most partisan  times in our Nation's history, we came together in Congress to pass  badly needed help for the American people: PPP loans for small  businesses; State and local funding to help with contact tracing,  testing, and grants to those in need.  We passed an eviction moratorium so people could stay in their homes  and nutrition aid for the millions of families who suddenly are  experiencing food insecurity.  Now that we have good news about vaccines, now that we have hope for  the future, we have to pass another round of help so businesses can  make it through the winter, children can have access to food, families  can stay in their homes, and kids can get back to school.  There is a bipartisan deal that the Senate and House Members are on  board with, a deal that would provide relief to millions.  Let's once again show the American people that we are there for them  when it counts.    "
482,John Shimkus,0.019880272448062897,R,shimkus,shimkus," Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, as ranking member on the Subcommittee of  Environment and Climate Change, I want to thank Chief Counsel Mary  Martin, Deputy Chief Counsel Jerry Couri, and senior professional staff  member, Peter Spencer, for their tremendous support of me and  commonsense, practical legislation that has protected human health and  the environment and supports jobs and the economy.  If the public knew how hard that committee staff members work, they  would have a better appreciation of our government. Mary, Jerry, Peter,  you have my personal thanks.  I would also be remiss if I didn't thank the loyal opposition,  Democrat Staff Director Rick Kessler and Democrat Senior Counsel Jackie  Cohen. Although many times adversaries, both have become friends.    "
483,Michael Simpson,0.05964081361889839,R,simpson,simpson," Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the fiscal year  2021 omnibus appropriations bill, and particularly the Energy and Water  Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.  As ranking member of the subcommittee, I am pleased this bill is  significantly improved from the House bill in many ways.  First and foremost, the bill strongly supports our national nuclear  security programs, providing $15.3 billion for the Weapons Activities  account, an increase of $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2020. This  funding supports the maintenance and modernization of our nuclear  weapons system, which will ensure a credible and reliable nuclear  deterrent.  One of my personal priorities is promoting innovation and growth in  nuclear energy. This bill provides almost $1.4 billion for research,  development, and demonstration activities, including increased funding  for the Advanced Small Modular Reactors Program and the Advanced  Reactors Demonstration Program, both programs focused on building the  next generation of carbon-free technologies to be deployed here and  abroad.  The bill also includes critical water storage projects in the  drought-prone West, such as the Anderson Ranch Dam raise in my district  in Idaho.  Mr. Speaker, before I yield back, I would like to thank the full  committee ranking member, Kay Granger, who has so ably led our  Republican Conference on appropriations matters all Congress long. And  full committee Chairwoman Lowey deserves our thanks for her many years  of service in this committee and to the Nation. We will miss her.  Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Chairwoman Marcy  Kaptur and I, again, worked well with our Senate partners, Lamar  Alexander and Dianne Feinstein, to advance national and constituent  interests throughout the programs that are funded in this bill.  Finally, I would like to thank staff on both sides of the aisle for  their hard work--extremely hard work--particularly this last month,  working to help bring this bill to completion.  Mr. Speaker, this appropriations package, which includes the Energy  and Water division, is a strong bill, and I urge my colleagues to  support it.    "
484,Albio Sires,0.31677141785621643,D,sires,sires," Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman DeFazio for  including a provision in this bill that is a triumph in national  transportation financing.  Our States are riddled with bridges that are too old, roads that are  in disrepair, and passenger rail that is falling apart. Regionally and  nationally significant projects, projects that everyone can agree are  important and need to be built, have languished for years because of no  Federal help. This bill changes that.  I am proud to say that this bill's provision on projects of national  and regional significance is a victory for the Gateway Project. New  Jersey knows how important it is to get the project done. The whole  region knows how important the project is to its economy. This bill  puts $9 billion into the pot.  The bill provides money for clean energy investments to keep our air  clean, money for resiliency projects to protect us from stronger  storms, and more money for public transit to keep cars off the road.  There is no reason why we can't have a modern, efficient, clean  national infrastructure. This bill puts us on our way, and I am proud  to have been involved in the development since the beginning. I am  proud to cosponsor, and I ask everyone to support this bill.    "
485,Elissa Slotkin,1.2889918088912964,D,slotkin,slotkin," Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today, on the eve of a hopeful vote on the  next COVID relief bill that our Problem Solvers Caucus has so ably led  the charge on, I rise to tell the stories of three individuals from my  district. Their stories represent just a fraction of the messages I  have been receiving on COVID relief.  But today, on the floor of the people's House, I rise because they  deserve to be heard. Their stories are the reason we refuse to go home  for Christmas without an agreement. They are why we continue to fight  until a deal is reached.  First, I would like to talk about Bob, who wrote to me from Brighton,  Michigan. Bob is a pillar of his community. After serving his Nation in  the Army National Guard for 6 years, he has been giving back to his  fellow veterans for over 21 years as a district post commander for The  American Legion.  But for the first time in 16 years, Bob recently found himself laid  off from his job in construction due to the coronavirus. To cover his  expenses, like 171,000 others in Michigan, he had to file a first-time  claim for unemployment insurance. Despite being eligible for the  State's maximum benefit, he cannot make ends meet.  Between medications and health insurance, mortgage and car payments,  utilities and food, he is having to turn to his savings, and he knows  that won't last long.  Bob is responsible, a straight shooter, and he has served our  country. He is the kind of Michigander who anyone would want in their  corner, but right now, he is asking for help, not sometime in the  future, not after the inauguration of a new President.  He is asking us to pass a bill that helps the millions of Americans  who are in need. It is our job, and it is our duty to rise to that  call.  {time} 1230  I am also pushing for relief for Richard, who is from my hometown of  Holly, Michigan. Richard chairs our Downtown Development Authority  Board, which supports the businesses on Main Street, many of which have  been devastated by the pandemic.  Richard has had a front row seat to how critical the situation is, so  he wrote me, asking what the Federal Government is going to do to save  small businesses from bankruptcy.  I had the chance to talk to Richard over the phone this week, and we  agreed that small businesses need loans and clarity on whether those  loans will be forgiven or if they can deduct that loan in tax season.  This is what we will hopefully be voting on in the next 48 hours in the  update to the PPP program.  Richard and I do not see eye to eye on every issue, but when it comes  to our local businesses, we are residents of Holly first. We agree that  small businesses need a bridge to get them through the next year when  the vaccine will be widely available. After all, it is business owners  like Richard who have shown the grit and resilience needed to adapt to  these challenging times. It is only right that we have their backs when  they need it most.  Mr. Speaker, lastly, I am pushing for this bill because of Karli. She  is a server at Mackle's in Hartland, Michigan--where, by the way, they  have the best buffalo chicken wing tenders ever--and the best part of  the job for her is creating memorable experiences for guests who come  to share a meal. But these days, with the kitchen converted fully to  takeout, she is working half as many shifts and taking home half the  pay she used to.  COVID blindsided her and the rest of the service industry, and now  she is worried about the bills that are piling up. In between shifts  and stretching every paycheck, she is going to school to become a  nurse, joining the absolute front line of America's latest war. Simply  put, she can't imagine going into the new year with no extra help.  Mr. Speaker, she ends her letter with these words: ``Please help take  care of us so we can get back to taking care of you as our guests.''  Take care of us so we can take care of you.  Mr. Speaker, think about that for a moment. In the middle of a global  pandemic, one that has claimed 300,000 American lives and upended our  way of life, that is the mantra of folks on the ground, folks who just  want to take care of their neighbors and their communities. They are  not asking for the government to solve every problem, but they expect  their government to act.  For residents in my district, an agreement is more than just numbers  on a page. It is a ray of hope that maybe they will spend Christmas a  little less worried. It is a new year that they can truly look forward  to. It is a sign that, when their backs are up against the wall and  they need help, Congress can get in a room and agree on a deal. [["", Page , H7235, ]  Mr. Speaker, we are so close to that finish line, and so I ask all my  colleagues to join me in heeding the pleas of Bob and Richard and  Karli. Let's do the right thing. Let's pass a bill so we can help those  who need it the most.    "
486,Adam Smith,2.3864636421203613,D,smith,smith," Ms. SMITH. Madam President, today I wish to recognize and celebrate  the lives of James Rogers, Charles Nord, and Kort Plantenberg, all  members of the Minnesota National Guard, who tragically lost their  lives in a helicopter accident on Thursday, December 5. After returning  home safely from deployment to the Middle East in May, this loss is  especially heart wrenching. These men conducted medical evacuations in  the Middle East, and their service to our troops and allies will not be  forgotten. I am grateful for their service and sacrifice for Minnesota  and our country.  CW2 James Rogers, often remembered for his curious nature, served 10  years in the Minnesota National Guard, having enlisted before his high  school graduation. CW2 Charles Nord enlisted in 2007, and he leaves  behind his wife, young daughter, and a child on the way. SGT James  Plantenberg enlisted in 2016, was a member of the Guard's biathlon  team, and was preparing to start flight school. We are all indebted to  these men for their service, and I wish their families peace during  this time of tragic loss.    "
487,Adam Smith,2.3864636421203613,D,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for  yielding. I thank Mr. Wilson for his great work, and I want to thank my  distinguished colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Eliot Engel and  Michael McCaul. Thank you for your support in helping to get this  legislation to the floor. I thank Chairman Keating, as well.  Mr. Speaker, I urge swift enactment into law of this bipartisan bill  called the Belarus Democracy Human Rights and Sovereignty Act of 2020,  which I have introduced.  And here is why this legislation is absolutely needed right now; not  next year, not when we come back, hopefully the Senate will take it up  if it passes today, and I think it will, but we need this right now.  Many of my colleagues know, and perhaps they know it well, that  Belarus was perhaps the nation most mired in the Soviet past, with an  inefficient economy and a strongman autocrat, really a dictator, in  charge for over two and a half decades, Alexander Lukashenko. Yet the  indomitable spirit of freedom stirred among the people of Belarus, and  when a patently false election--another one--was announced on August 9  declaring Lukashenko the winner, the people took to the streets. And  they are still on the streets today.  The OSCE Moscow Mechanism reported November 5 that there is  ``'overwhelming' evidence that Belarus' August 9 presidential election  results were falsified and as `systematic' human rights violations have  been committed by the country's security forces in response to the  peaceful demonstrations that the vote sparked.''  Now, reports out of Belarus indicate that police are using  increasingly violent tactics against these peaceful protesters.  The BBC summed it up yesterday in an article titled, ``Belarus  protesters battered, bruised, but defiant after 100 days,'' which said  in part, ``opposition protesters remain defiant in Belarus despite  police brutality, 100 days after they first took to the streets to  denounce the reelection of President Alexander Lukashenko. Police in  helmets and body armour throw women holding flowers and balloons into  police vans.''  And, of course, then it only gets worse. ``Officers tear-gas elderly  people on a pensioners' march. . . .  ``Yet every Sunday thousands still pour into the streets of the  capital Minsk, condemning what they see as Mr. Lukashenko's fraudulent  9 August victory. . . . `'  There is a report that points out, again a BBC report, ``Alesya, a  31-year-old worker in the IT industry, regularly attends the Sunday  rallies. On 15 November, however, things turned nasty very quickly.  ``When she arrived at the square,'' she said, ``where the march was  supposed to start, it was already packed with security forces. As more  people gathered, officers fired stun grenades and started hitting  people with batons to disperse the crowd.  ``They attacked us again and again. It was awful. They ferociously  beat people, twisted their arms and took them away.  ``She ran away into one of the courtyards following other protesters,  but police in their minivans quickly caught up with them even there.  She was saved,'' she goes on, ``by a stranger who hid her and several  others in his house.''  {time} 1530  She goes on to say, ``It was like World War II, when people tried to  hide Jews from the Nazis. It was terrifying, we were shocked.''  That particular march was called in memory of Roman Bondarenko, an  activist who was so severely beaten while in detention, that he died in  the hospital just last week.  Mr. Speaker, the Congress can and we must do our part in this crisis.  The people of Belarus, especially the pro-democracy leaders,  desperately need our help, and they need it right now.  As my colleagues know, the leading opposition presidential candidate,  Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya, almost certainly won the election in August.  She went on to form the Coordination Council.  The democratic opposition is united, it is smart, it is principled,  tenacious, and it is extraordinarily brave.  Ms. Tsikhanouskaya ran a courageous campaign, but today is in exile  in Lithuania, in Vilnius, where she continues to rally the Belarusian  people and the world and demand that democracy and human rights for all  people be given to her nation.  A couple weeks ago I read portions of a transcript of a hearing I  chaired in 2011 after another fraudulent Belarusian election put  Lukashenko back in power. Then as now, and on so many other occasions,  Lukashenko's bullies beat, jailed, assaulted, tortured, raped, and  killed peaceful protesters, but now it is going on right as we meet  here today as never before.  The big mistake of the past, fatigue or lack of commitment and  perseverance by the international community, can't be repeated this  time. We can't be outraged at first and then turn the page and say,  ``Now what?''  We need to have a determined effort to help these people who are  struggling for democracy and human rights in their nation.  On two separate occasions, I would note parenthetically, I met with  Lukashenko in Minsk and came away resolved to accelerate the struggle  for democracy and freedom.  I was with a group of 11 Members, including some of our members on  the committee, and he pointed to me, because I am the author of the  Belarus Democracy Act of 2004, and said, ``There is public enemy number  one.''  That is how he thinks. Anybody who aspires for freedom and democracy,  particularly against his brutal regime, is construed to be a public  enemy. And for the people of Belarus, they go to jail, where they are  beaten senselessly.  Our bipartisan bill, "", H.R. 8438, "", again, cosponsored by Mr. Engel, Mr.  McCaul, Mr. Keating, Mr. Kinzinger, and so many other Members of this  House, updates, strengthens, and expands the Belarus Democracy Acts of  2004, 2006, and 2011, laws that I also authored, and renews the  personal, economic, and visa sanctions on an expanded list of actors in  the Belarusian Government, and now for the first time on Russian  individuals complicit in this crackdown.  I would note parenthetically, the Magnitsky Act, the idea of  personally sanctioning with visa denial as well as economic sanctions  on individuals that led to the Global Magnitsky Act came out of the  Belarus Democracy Act of 2004.  So it is an idea, it is a method of holding those who commit these  abuses personally accountable.  When you sanction an entire nation, that has an impact, but innocent  people do get hurt. This sanctions the individuals who are perpetrators  of these heinous crimes.  Yesterday, Svetlana again called for the sanctions, just yesterday  for the sanctions that are embedded in our bill. So the time to act is  now.  The bill also has other provisions. It does call for new elections.  It recognizes the Coordination Council as a legitimate institution to  participate in a dialogue on a peaceful transition of power. They are  the ones we need to be talking to.  It calls for the release of all political prisoners, and that number  rises by the day.  It supports the aspirations of the people to exercise their religious  freedom. There has been a crackdown there as well.  It authorizes assistance to promote democracy in civil society in  Belarus. On occasions in Minsk, I have met with those individuals. They  are brave beyond words, because they always know somebody is lurking-- the secret police--just waiting to haul them off to prison.  It unequivocally states that it is the policy of the U.S. ``not to  recognize any incorporation of Belarus into a `Union State' with  Russia.'' Russia is using this crisis as a pretext to further manifest  their monopoly of power. They would love--like they did in parts of  Ukraine, South Ossetia, Abkhazia--to just take the whole of Belarus  into their national boundary.  The bill requires the U.S. strategy to promote broadcasting, internet  freedom, and access to information. [["", Page , H5920, ]  In addition, it gives much needed support to the Belarusian media and  to the IT sector.  By passing this bill today followed by, hopefully, swift approval in  the Senate and signature into law by the President, we not only  reiterate, but significantly expand our support and solidarity with the  great people of Belarus. We need to pass this bill and I respectfully  call on our Senate colleagues to pass it as well.    "
488,Adam Smith,2.3864636421203613,D,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of "", H.R. 2477, "", which includes  some legislation to improve Medicare coverage for kidney transplant  recipients.  The Trump administration has made increasing rates of kidney  transplantation a priority. It is more cost-effective than dialysis and  results in a dramatic increase in the quality of life for ESRD  patients. However, these patients must continue taking medication for  the remainder of their life so that they don't reject their organs.  Currently, Medicare will only cover the cost of these drugs for 36  months after a kidney transplant. Patients who do not have health  insurance or lose their insurance coverage have to choose between  paying thousands of dollars a month out of pocket or risk the chance of  rejection of their organs.  If organ rejection does occur, these patients must once again endure  the painful, time-consuming, and expensive dialysis treatments paid for  by the Medicare program. By simply paying for the cost of these drugs  and preventing patients from crashing back into dialysis, the Federal  Government [["", Page , H6999, ] can save hundreds of millions of dollars and improve thousands of  lives.  We should not allow such unnecessary waste and suffering to occur.  These Americans should not have to worry about how they will afford the  cost of the medications that allow them to live a completely normal  life.  Madam Speaker, I thank Representatives Kind and Burgess for their  leadership and for working together on this commonsense bipartisan  bill.  Madam Speaker, I urge the House to pass ', H.R. 2477, '.    "
489,Adam Smith,2.3864636421203613,D,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Steve  Nelson, a corn and soybean farmer from Axtell, Nebraska, on his  retirement as president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau.  The Nebraska Farm Bureau is a leading voice for Nebraska agriculture  producers because of its hardworking members and leaders like Steve,  whose hard work and leadership have made the Third District of Nebraska  the top-producing agriculture district in America.  Steve has served as president through the completion of two farm  bills, ensuring the needs of Nebraska producers are reflected and met  throughout the process--no small task.  I have appreciated Steve's persistence in the face of many challenges  we have faced in Nebraska recently, especially the historic floods,  storms, the irrigation tunnel collapse, and certainly other  uncertainties. Those affected, though, were always able to turn to the  Nebraska Farm Bureau.  I would like to thank Steve for his great work, and I wish him well  as he continues as a farm producer at home and advocating for our  State's farmers and ranchers.    "
490,Adam Smith,2.3864636421203613,D,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  I rise to strongly urge Members to uphold what we did in this Chamber  just a couple weeks ago and what the Senate did, as well; and that is  we passed an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill, with roughly 80 percent of  the vote in both the Senate and the House.  The legislative branch made it absolutely clear that we support this  piece of legislation, and as the gentleman from Texas just noted, we  support it with very good reason.  It is enormously important to give our troops the support that they  need to carry out the job that we all are asking them to do. That is, I  think, one of our minimum obligations as Members of Congress. And this  bill reflects that.  This bill is the process of a lengthy effort involving Members of  both Chambers, both parties, that have come together and put together  an incredibly strong piece of legislation. That is why it passed so  overwhelmingly just a couple weeks ago. And nothing has changed.  Nothing has changed. The bill is exactly the same and every little bit  as important.  Now, the President has the right to veto it, but I think we, as  Members of [["", Page , H9161, ] the legislative body, have to look at the reason behind that. Was it  because of something in the bill?  Pieces of legislation come through here all the time, and we  occasionally miss something. The President finds out, and we say: Gosh,  I didn't know that. That is not what happened here.  I really want Members to understand the President vetoed this because  of something that isn't in the bill and was never going to be in the  bill, something totally unrelated to national security and something  that we were not going to do in any event.  There is literally no reason to veto this bill for the reasons that  the President did and certainly no reason for us not to uphold what we  did in passing this bill. This is really important that we exercise our  legislative prerogative.  There are all kinds of crucial provisions in this bill, but I will  just point to one, and that is the one that Mr. Thornberry mentioned  earlier, to give you an idea of why it is important that the  legislative branch do its job in exercising oversight of the Department  of Defense in providing national security policy, and that is the cyber  issue.  Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Langevin, chairman of the  subcommittee that deals with this issue, and Ranking Member Stefanik,  they have worked together to really put together an incredible package  to try to better address these very cyber issues that we are now  facing. That is what we do in this legislation, and it is not always  exciting, but it is incredibly important to meet our obligation to our  troops and to the national security of this country.  It is enormously important that we pass this bill. We did it once.  Let's just do it one more time, and then we can all go home for the  year. We can be done, and we can be proud of what we have accomplished.  I urge Members to vote in favor of this bill to do what we did just a  couple weeks ago. Show the country that the legislative branch can  still do its job.  I will close on one note, which we make a lot of times.  {time} 1700  This is the most bipartisan committee in Congress. That is not an  easy thing to achieve. We have a lot of things that we passionately  disagree about in this body, and we should, but on the Armed Services  bill, we manage to come together. It is not always easy, but we get it  done.  I think it is enormously important that we let the country know that  that process hasn't died. We put together a product, a bipartisan,  bicameral product that has gotten an overwhelming number of votes.  Let's show the American public that the legislative process works at  least a little bit better than sometimes they think it does, that we  can get our job done and, in this case, get our job done for the men  and women who put their lives on the line to protect this country. We  owe them nothing less than that.  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees  on the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, I rise in  strong opposition to the Administration's seemingly callous veto of the  William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2021 and proudly announce my intention to vote to override  this reckless veto.  I take this action because I disagree with the President that  preserving monuments and memorials and naming military installations  for the defenders of slavery who took up arms against the United States  to achieve their aims is more important and a higher priority than  providing the funding, resources, and support to the nation's military  and civilian defense person, one of the nation's most respected  institutions and its most diverse and representative.  Other than his pique at being on the short end of what is by his own  account an Electoral College landslide and being routed by seven  million votes in his failed bid for reelection, there is absolutely no  basis for the erstwhile Commander-in-Chief to veto the bipartisan NDAA  and deny our servicemembers a long-overdue pay raise and hazard duty  pay many of whom live in or are from my congressional district.  It is cruel, shameful, and heartless for a Commander-in-Chief to deny  to more than 100,000 federal employees the paid family leave child  care, housing and health protections authorized by the FY2021 NDAA or  to withhold from our veterans the benefits that they need and deserve.  The FY2021 NDAA Conference Report, negotiated under the careful  stewardship of Chairman Adam Smith of Washington and Ranking Member Mac  Thornberry in the House and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman  James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Ranking Member Jack Reed of Rhode Island  is carefully crafted, exemplary legislation reflecting the nation's  sacred commitment to those who willingly risk their lives, fortunes,  and sacred honor to keep our nation safe and preserve, protect, and  defend the Constitution.  The FY21 NDAA provides a long-sought after benefit for tens of  thousands of Vietnam-era veterans who are struggling with certain  health complications after being exposed to Agent Orange while serving  their country.  In addition, the legislation authorizes $8.4 billion in military  construction projects to fortify critical infrastructure and base  realignment and closure clean up, it contains important new tools to  deter adversaries China and Russia from attacking or threatening our  national interests; and mandates reforms to make the Pentagon more  efficient, innovative, and cost-effective.  In the legislation there are significant bipartisan provisions to  strengthen our posture on artificial intelligence and cybersecurity and  to fortify our alliance with NATO and our security relationship with  Israel.  With the passage of the FY2021 NDAA, expectant mothers in the  military could receive free loaner maternity uniforms because the  legislation directs the Department of Defense to conduct a pilot  program to issue maternity uniforms and related items to pregnant  military members on a temporary and as-needed basis.  Madam Speaker, this is important because women make up about 21  percent of the Air Force; 20.2 percent of the Navy; 15.4 percent of the  Army; and 9 percent of the Marine Corps.  Also, the FY2021 NDAA makes needed reforms to prevent sexual assault,  a matter of great importance to the public and my colleagues,  particularly those of us from Texas, where Fort Hood is located and  where Army Specialist Vanessa Guillen was murdered to prevent her from  reporting the sexual harassment and abuse she suffered from her direct  superior in the chain of command.  I am very grateful to Congressman Brown of Maryland, himself a  veteran of the Armed Services, for his leadership in ensuring the NDAA  authorize and approve the renaming of military bases currently named  for persons who took up arms for the Confederacy and against the United  States.  I am very pleased that included in the legislation is my language  directing the consideration be given to distinguished and heroic  African-American and Native American servicemembers in the renaming of  military bases.  Removing the stain of bases and military installations being name for  confederate traitors is an act of profound reconciliation and healing.  For too long African Americans servicemembers have been forced to  tolerate the hidden racism that existed under the guise of the rebel  flag, knowing through oral history the brutality of those who  voluntarily fought for the Confederacy.  The FY2021 NDAA ushers in a new enlightened era where the names of  traitors who took up arms against the United States will have their  names removed from places of honor such as military bases or  installations.  These individuals will not be forgotten; instead they will have a  permanent place in history and their records will be studied and  examined in full by historians and scholars.  Madam Speaker, it is also fitting that FY2021 NDAA directs the  Department of Defense to take concrete actions to recognize and  memorialize the contributions made by African Americans and Native  Americans servicemembers in defense of our nation.  The history of African Americans and Native Americans serving in the  military date back to the colonial period of our nation to the present  day.  In every war waged from the Battle of Lexington to the Battle for  Fallujah, African Americans and Native Americans have honorably  answered the call to duty, and served with great valor and distinction  in America's armed forces.  At decisive moments in our nation's history, the United States  military and its citizens warriors answered the call and were decisive  in the nation's epic battles for freedom and liberty, including:  Revolutionary War (1776-1783); War of 1812 (1812-1814); Mexican- American War (1836); Civil War (1861-1865); Spanish-American War  (1898); World War I (1914-1918); World War II (1941-1945); Korean War  (1950-1953); Vietnam War (1965-1975); Gulf War (1991); and Operations  Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, as well as conflicts in other  theaters of war. [["", Page , H9162, ]  The military was there doing a job no other branch of our nation's  government could do--in the face of overwhelming danger--when the fate  of the American Experiment was on the line.  Our thanks to the military for always answering the call of duty-- whether that call comes in the dead of night or the light of day--we  know that we can count on you.  The names and faces of millions of African Americans who have served  our nation in uniform may fade from memory, but today we have the  opportunity to remember and see them in the faces of the young men and  women who preserved freedom in the world, even at a time when the  blessings of liberty were denied to them at home.  The Jackson Lee provision in the FY2021 NDAA recognizes that there is  no shortage of distinguished veterans, and especially African American  and Native American veterans, who are worthy of the honor of naming a  military facility in their honor.  Let me provide for the record some representative candidates.  UNITED STATES ARMY  General Roscoe Robinson Jr., the first black four-star general in the  Army and 1951 West Point graduate who attended the service academy  before the Army was desegregated and served in Korea and Vietnam, with  valor decorations in both conflicts, and as a training officer as part  of the U.S. military support mission in Liberia. He went on to become  the first black commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, deputy chief  of staff for operations in U.S. Army Europe, commander of U.S. Forces  Japan, the U.S. representative on the NATO Military Committee.  William Harvey Carney was the first African American recipient of the  Congressional Medal of Honor, which he received for his actions on July  18, 1863 at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, while a member of the 54th  Massachusetts Regiment in the Civil War--the state's first all-black  regiment.  The 54th Massachusetts was the subject of the film, ``Glory,''  starring Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman.  Lieutenant Colonel Charity Edna Adams was appointed to lead the  African American Women's Army Corps unit designated as the 6888th  Central Postal Directory Battalion, which became known as the ``Six  Triple Eight.''  The ``Six Triple Eight'' unit was instrumental in establishing and  maintaining morale because it assured that mail from the battlefront  and the home-front flowed efficiently and timely.  Lt. Col. Margaret E. Bailey of the Army Nurse Corps was the first  nurse to be promoted to lieutenant colonel.  UNITED STATES NAVY  Messman First Class Dorie Miller was serving in a noncombat role in  the Navy, when he acted heroically to defend lives after his ship, the  USS West Virginia was attacked at Pearl Harbor.  He was the first African American to be awarded the Navy Cross, the  third highest honor awarded by the United States Navy at the time.  Admiral Michelle Howard is a four-star Admiral and one of the  highest-ranking African American women ever to serve in any branch of  the military. Admiral Howard is also the first African American woman  to command a U.S. naval vessel, the USS Rushmore.  She is the Navy's second highest ranking officer and is currently  serving as the commander of U.S. Naval Forces Africa, commander of U.S.  Naval Forces Europe, and commander of Allied Joint Force Command  Naples.  UNITED STATES AIR FORCE  In 2012, Lieutenant Colonel Shawna Rochelle-Kimbrell became the first  female African American fighter pilot in the Air Force history and her  flights in Northern Watch marked her as the first female pilot to fly  combat missions for Misawa's 35th Fighter Wing and the first African  American woman to employ ordinance in combat. She has logged more than  1,110 hours in the F-16, including 176 hours of combat time.  Colonel Ruth A. Lucas was the first African American woman in the Air  Force to be promoted to the rank of colonel. At the time of her  retirement in 1970, she was the highest-ranking African American woman  in the Air Force.  In 1959 General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. became the first African  American Major General in the United States Air Force. As the organizer  and commander of famed 332nd Fighter Group known as the Tuskegee  Airmen, his place in history will be forever remembered and revered.  General Davis received many decorations during his career, including  two Distinguished Service Medals and a Silver Star and on December 9,  1998, General Davis was awarded his fourth general's star by President  Bill Clinton.  UNITED STATES COAST GUARD  Chief Petty Officer Alex Haley is best known for writing letters for  his shipmates and his short stories and articles, which got him  promoted to Chief Journalist of the Coast Guard in 1959.  Haley ultimately received a number of military honors, including the  American Defense Service Medal, World War II Victory Medal and an  honorary degree from the Coast Guard Academy but most of you know him  also as the author of ``Roots,'' the path-breaking and epic retracing  of a family's history from the Gambian coast in Africa to the New World  in America.  In 1957, Captain Bobby Wilks became the first African American Coast  Guard aviator. He later became the first African American to reach the  rank of Captain and the first to command a Coast Guard air station. He  accumulated over 6,000 flight hours in 18 different types of aircrafts.  Madam Speaker, 25 percent of the today's active duty military is  comprised of persons of color, of which 17.8 percent are African  American.  This percentage outpaces the percentage of African Americans in the  general population (13 percent) but lagging significantly is the 9% of  African Americans in the commissioned officer ranks.  NATIVE AMERICANS  The Jackson Lee Amendment offered during House consideration of the  NDAA was expanded to include Native Americans.  It is without doubt that the military has a storied history of Native  American contributions to the securing our nation since colonial times  to the present.  One famous example of their contributions occurred during World War  II when the U.S. military developed a specific policy to recruit and  train Navajo speakers to become ``code talkers.''  Code Talker is the name given to 29 Navajo Natives who used their  tribal language to send secret communications on the battlefield.  The Marines formed the Navajo Code Talkers, who created a code based  on the complex, unwritten Navajo language.  The code primarily used word association by assigning a Navajo word  to key phrases and military tactics.  This system enabled the Code Talkers to translate three lines of  English in 20 seconds, not 30 minutes as was common with existing  codebreaking machines.  The Code Talkers participated in every major Marine operation in the  Pacific theater, giving the Marines a critical advantage throughout the  war.  During the nearly month-long battle for Iwo Jima, for example, six  Navajo Code Talker Marines successfully transmitted more than 800  messages without error.  Marine leadership noted after the battle that the Code Talkers were  critical to the victory at Iwo Jima.  The Navajo Code was never broken.  Our Native American brothers and sisters are more than worthy to be  so honored by having their names considered for military bases and  installations.  BOOGALOO AND PROUD BOYS  Another Jackson Lee Amendment included in the House version of the  NDAA directed the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress the  extent, if any, of the threat to national security posed by domestic  terrorist groups and organizations motivated by a belief system of  white supremacy, such as extremist groups like the Boogaloo Boys and  the Proud Boys, is reflected in the Conference bill.  The concern is that in the aftermath of a historic national election,  the activity of violence influencers like Boogaloo Boys or Proud Boys  will increase and lead to attacks becoming more frequent.  We have witnessed too many instances of violent extremists searching  for opportunities to sow violence and disrupt democratic processes and  Boogaloo and Proud Boys are targeting constitutionally protected  activity to coopt or to provide cover for attacks.  Jackson Lee Amendment 179 implements a recommendation made by the  Cyberspace Solarium Commission to require the Secretary of Homeland  Security to develop a strategy to implement Domain-based Message  Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) standard across  U.S.-based email providers to increase the security of email,  The security of email has grown in importance as it has become in  many ways the primary way that businesses, consumers, government  communicate.  The Senate bill also addressed this important issue and the language  of the final Conference concurs.  For all these reasons, I urge all Members to join me in voting to  override the President's unwise and ill-considered veto of the William  M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2021.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered.  There was no objection.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Will the House, on  reconsideration, pass the bill, the objections [["", Page , H9163, ] of the President to the contrary notwithstanding?  Under the Constitution, the vote must be by the yeas and nays.  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question  will be postponed.    "
491,Adrian Smith,0.24349777400493622,R,smith,smith," Ms. SMITH. Madam President, today I wish to recognize and celebrate  the lives of James Rogers, Charles Nord, and Kort Plantenberg, all  members of the Minnesota National Guard, who tragically lost their  lives in a helicopter accident on Thursday, December 5. After returning  home safely from deployment to the Middle East in May, this loss is  especially heart wrenching. These men conducted medical evacuations in  the Middle East, and their service to our troops and allies will not be  forgotten. I am grateful for their service and sacrifice for Minnesota  and our country.  CW2 James Rogers, often remembered for his curious nature, served 10  years in the Minnesota National Guard, having enlisted before his high  school graduation. CW2 Charles Nord enlisted in 2007, and he leaves  behind his wife, young daughter, and a child on the way. SGT James  Plantenberg enlisted in 2016, was a member of the Guard's biathlon  team, and was preparing to start flight school. We are all indebted to  these men for their service, and I wish their families peace during  this time of tragic loss.    "
492,Adrian Smith,0.24349777400493622,R,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for  yielding. I thank Mr. Wilson for his great work, and I want to thank my  distinguished colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Eliot Engel and  Michael McCaul. Thank you for your support in helping to get this  legislation to the floor. I thank Chairman Keating, as well.  Mr. Speaker, I urge swift enactment into law of this bipartisan bill  called the Belarus Democracy Human Rights and Sovereignty Act of 2020,  which I have introduced.  And here is why this legislation is absolutely needed right now; not  next year, not when we come back, hopefully the Senate will take it up  if it passes today, and I think it will, but we need this right now.  Many of my colleagues know, and perhaps they know it well, that  Belarus was perhaps the nation most mired in the Soviet past, with an  inefficient economy and a strongman autocrat, really a dictator, in  charge for over two and a half decades, Alexander Lukashenko. Yet the  indomitable spirit of freedom stirred among the people of Belarus, and  when a patently false election--another one--was announced on August 9  declaring Lukashenko the winner, the people took to the streets. And  they are still on the streets today.  The OSCE Moscow Mechanism reported November 5 that there is  ``'overwhelming' evidence that Belarus' August 9 presidential election  results were falsified and as `systematic' human rights violations have  been committed by the country's security forces in response to the  peaceful demonstrations that the vote sparked.''  Now, reports out of Belarus indicate that police are using  increasingly violent tactics against these peaceful protesters.  The BBC summed it up yesterday in an article titled, ``Belarus  protesters battered, bruised, but defiant after 100 days,'' which said  in part, ``opposition protesters remain defiant in Belarus despite  police brutality, 100 days after they first took to the streets to  denounce the reelection of President Alexander Lukashenko. Police in  helmets and body armour throw women holding flowers and balloons into  police vans.''  And, of course, then it only gets worse. ``Officers tear-gas elderly  people on a pensioners' march. . . .  ``Yet every Sunday thousands still pour into the streets of the  capital Minsk, condemning what they see as Mr. Lukashenko's fraudulent  9 August victory. . . . `'  There is a report that points out, again a BBC report, ``Alesya, a  31-year-old worker in the IT industry, regularly attends the Sunday  rallies. On 15 November, however, things turned nasty very quickly.  ``When she arrived at the square,'' she said, ``where the march was  supposed to start, it was already packed with security forces. As more  people gathered, officers fired stun grenades and started hitting  people with batons to disperse the crowd.  ``They attacked us again and again. It was awful. They ferociously  beat people, twisted their arms and took them away.  ``She ran away into one of the courtyards following other protesters,  but police in their minivans quickly caught up with them even there.  She was saved,'' she goes on, ``by a stranger who hid her and several  others in his house.''  {time} 1530  She goes on to say, ``It was like World War II, when people tried to  hide Jews from the Nazis. It was terrifying, we were shocked.''  That particular march was called in memory of Roman Bondarenko, an  activist who was so severely beaten while in detention, that he died in  the hospital just last week.  Mr. Speaker, the Congress can and we must do our part in this crisis.  The people of Belarus, especially the pro-democracy leaders,  desperately need our help, and they need it right now.  As my colleagues know, the leading opposition presidential candidate,  Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya, almost certainly won the election in August.  She went on to form the Coordination Council.  The democratic opposition is united, it is smart, it is principled,  tenacious, and it is extraordinarily brave.  Ms. Tsikhanouskaya ran a courageous campaign, but today is in exile  in Lithuania, in Vilnius, where she continues to rally the Belarusian  people and the world and demand that democracy and human rights for all  people be given to her nation.  A couple weeks ago I read portions of a transcript of a hearing I  chaired in 2011 after another fraudulent Belarusian election put  Lukashenko back in power. Then as now, and on so many other occasions,  Lukashenko's bullies beat, jailed, assaulted, tortured, raped, and  killed peaceful protesters, but now it is going on right as we meet  here today as never before.  The big mistake of the past, fatigue or lack of commitment and  perseverance by the international community, can't be repeated this  time. We can't be outraged at first and then turn the page and say,  ``Now what?''  We need to have a determined effort to help these people who are  struggling for democracy and human rights in their nation.  On two separate occasions, I would note parenthetically, I met with  Lukashenko in Minsk and came away resolved to accelerate the struggle  for democracy and freedom.  I was with a group of 11 Members, including some of our members on  the committee, and he pointed to me, because I am the author of the  Belarus Democracy Act of 2004, and said, ``There is public enemy number  one.''  That is how he thinks. Anybody who aspires for freedom and democracy,  particularly against his brutal regime, is construed to be a public  enemy. And for the people of Belarus, they go to jail, where they are  beaten senselessly.  Our bipartisan bill, "", H.R. 8438, "", again, cosponsored by Mr. Engel, Mr.  McCaul, Mr. Keating, Mr. Kinzinger, and so many other Members of this  House, updates, strengthens, and expands the Belarus Democracy Acts of  2004, 2006, and 2011, laws that I also authored, and renews the  personal, economic, and visa sanctions on an expanded list of actors in  the Belarusian Government, and now for the first time on Russian  individuals complicit in this crackdown.  I would note parenthetically, the Magnitsky Act, the idea of  personally sanctioning with visa denial as well as economic sanctions  on individuals that led to the Global Magnitsky Act came out of the  Belarus Democracy Act of 2004.  So it is an idea, it is a method of holding those who commit these  abuses personally accountable.  When you sanction an entire nation, that has an impact, but innocent  people do get hurt. This sanctions the individuals who are perpetrators  of these heinous crimes.  Yesterday, Svetlana again called for the sanctions, just yesterday  for the sanctions that are embedded in our bill. So the time to act is  now.  The bill also has other provisions. It does call for new elections.  It recognizes the Coordination Council as a legitimate institution to  participate in a dialogue on a peaceful transition of power. They are  the ones we need to be talking to.  It calls for the release of all political prisoners, and that number  rises by the day.  It supports the aspirations of the people to exercise their religious  freedom. There has been a crackdown there as well.  It authorizes assistance to promote democracy in civil society in  Belarus. On occasions in Minsk, I have met with those individuals. They  are brave beyond words, because they always know somebody is lurking-- the secret police--just waiting to haul them off to prison.  It unequivocally states that it is the policy of the U.S. ``not to  recognize any incorporation of Belarus into a `Union State' with  Russia.'' Russia is using this crisis as a pretext to further manifest  their monopoly of power. They would love--like they did in parts of  Ukraine, South Ossetia, Abkhazia--to just take the whole of Belarus  into their national boundary.  The bill requires the U.S. strategy to promote broadcasting, internet  freedom, and access to information. [["", Page , H5920, ]  In addition, it gives much needed support to the Belarusian media and  to the IT sector.  By passing this bill today followed by, hopefully, swift approval in  the Senate and signature into law by the President, we not only  reiterate, but significantly expand our support and solidarity with the  great people of Belarus. We need to pass this bill and I respectfully  call on our Senate colleagues to pass it as well.    "
493,Adrian Smith,0.24349777400493622,R,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of "", H.R. 2477, "", which includes  some legislation to improve Medicare coverage for kidney transplant  recipients.  The Trump administration has made increasing rates of kidney  transplantation a priority. It is more cost-effective than dialysis and  results in a dramatic increase in the quality of life for ESRD  patients. However, these patients must continue taking medication for  the remainder of their life so that they don't reject their organs.  Currently, Medicare will only cover the cost of these drugs for 36  months after a kidney transplant. Patients who do not have health  insurance or lose their insurance coverage have to choose between  paying thousands of dollars a month out of pocket or risk the chance of  rejection of their organs.  If organ rejection does occur, these patients must once again endure  the painful, time-consuming, and expensive dialysis treatments paid for  by the Medicare program. By simply paying for the cost of these drugs  and preventing patients from crashing back into dialysis, the Federal  Government [["", Page , H6999, ] can save hundreds of millions of dollars and improve thousands of  lives.  We should not allow such unnecessary waste and suffering to occur.  These Americans should not have to worry about how they will afford the  cost of the medications that allow them to live a completely normal  life.  Madam Speaker, I thank Representatives Kind and Burgess for their  leadership and for working together on this commonsense bipartisan  bill.  Madam Speaker, I urge the House to pass ', H.R. 2477, '.    "
494,Adrian Smith,0.24349777400493622,R,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Steve  Nelson, a corn and soybean farmer from Axtell, Nebraska, on his  retirement as president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau.  The Nebraska Farm Bureau is a leading voice for Nebraska agriculture  producers because of its hardworking members and leaders like Steve,  whose hard work and leadership have made the Third District of Nebraska  the top-producing agriculture district in America.  Steve has served as president through the completion of two farm  bills, ensuring the needs of Nebraska producers are reflected and met  throughout the process--no small task.  I have appreciated Steve's persistence in the face of many challenges  we have faced in Nebraska recently, especially the historic floods,  storms, the irrigation tunnel collapse, and certainly other  uncertainties. Those affected, though, were always able to turn to the  Nebraska Farm Bureau.  I would like to thank Steve for his great work, and I wish him well  as he continues as a farm producer at home and advocating for our  State's farmers and ranchers.    "
495,Adrian Smith,0.24349777400493622,R,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  I rise to strongly urge Members to uphold what we did in this Chamber  just a couple weeks ago and what the Senate did, as well; and that is  we passed an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill, with roughly 80 percent of  the vote in both the Senate and the House.  The legislative branch made it absolutely clear that we support this  piece of legislation, and as the gentleman from Texas just noted, we  support it with very good reason.  It is enormously important to give our troops the support that they  need to carry out the job that we all are asking them to do. That is, I  think, one of our minimum obligations as Members of Congress. And this  bill reflects that.  This bill is the process of a lengthy effort involving Members of  both Chambers, both parties, that have come together and put together  an incredibly strong piece of legislation. That is why it passed so  overwhelmingly just a couple weeks ago. And nothing has changed.  Nothing has changed. The bill is exactly the same and every little bit  as important.  Now, the President has the right to veto it, but I think we, as  Members of [["", Page , H9161, ] the legislative body, have to look at the reason behind that. Was it  because of something in the bill?  Pieces of legislation come through here all the time, and we  occasionally miss something. The President finds out, and we say: Gosh,  I didn't know that. That is not what happened here.  I really want Members to understand the President vetoed this because  of something that isn't in the bill and was never going to be in the  bill, something totally unrelated to national security and something  that we were not going to do in any event.  There is literally no reason to veto this bill for the reasons that  the President did and certainly no reason for us not to uphold what we  did in passing this bill. This is really important that we exercise our  legislative prerogative.  There are all kinds of crucial provisions in this bill, but I will  just point to one, and that is the one that Mr. Thornberry mentioned  earlier, to give you an idea of why it is important that the  legislative branch do its job in exercising oversight of the Department  of Defense in providing national security policy, and that is the cyber  issue.  Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Langevin, chairman of the  subcommittee that deals with this issue, and Ranking Member Stefanik,  they have worked together to really put together an incredible package  to try to better address these very cyber issues that we are now  facing. That is what we do in this legislation, and it is not always  exciting, but it is incredibly important to meet our obligation to our  troops and to the national security of this country.  It is enormously important that we pass this bill. We did it once.  Let's just do it one more time, and then we can all go home for the  year. We can be done, and we can be proud of what we have accomplished.  I urge Members to vote in favor of this bill to do what we did just a  couple weeks ago. Show the country that the legislative branch can  still do its job.  I will close on one note, which we make a lot of times.  {time} 1700  This is the most bipartisan committee in Congress. That is not an  easy thing to achieve. We have a lot of things that we passionately  disagree about in this body, and we should, but on the Armed Services  bill, we manage to come together. It is not always easy, but we get it  done.  I think it is enormously important that we let the country know that  that process hasn't died. We put together a product, a bipartisan,  bicameral product that has gotten an overwhelming number of votes.  Let's show the American public that the legislative process works at  least a little bit better than sometimes they think it does, that we  can get our job done and, in this case, get our job done for the men  and women who put their lives on the line to protect this country. We  owe them nothing less than that.  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees  on the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, I rise in  strong opposition to the Administration's seemingly callous veto of the  William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2021 and proudly announce my intention to vote to override  this reckless veto.  I take this action because I disagree with the President that  preserving monuments and memorials and naming military installations  for the defenders of slavery who took up arms against the United States  to achieve their aims is more important and a higher priority than  providing the funding, resources, and support to the nation's military  and civilian defense person, one of the nation's most respected  institutions and its most diverse and representative.  Other than his pique at being on the short end of what is by his own  account an Electoral College landslide and being routed by seven  million votes in his failed bid for reelection, there is absolutely no  basis for the erstwhile Commander-in-Chief to veto the bipartisan NDAA  and deny our servicemembers a long-overdue pay raise and hazard duty  pay many of whom live in or are from my congressional district.  It is cruel, shameful, and heartless for a Commander-in-Chief to deny  to more than 100,000 federal employees the paid family leave child  care, housing and health protections authorized by the FY2021 NDAA or  to withhold from our veterans the benefits that they need and deserve.  The FY2021 NDAA Conference Report, negotiated under the careful  stewardship of Chairman Adam Smith of Washington and Ranking Member Mac  Thornberry in the House and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman  James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Ranking Member Jack Reed of Rhode Island  is carefully crafted, exemplary legislation reflecting the nation's  sacred commitment to those who willingly risk their lives, fortunes,  and sacred honor to keep our nation safe and preserve, protect, and  defend the Constitution.  The FY21 NDAA provides a long-sought after benefit for tens of  thousands of Vietnam-era veterans who are struggling with certain  health complications after being exposed to Agent Orange while serving  their country.  In addition, the legislation authorizes $8.4 billion in military  construction projects to fortify critical infrastructure and base  realignment and closure clean up, it contains important new tools to  deter adversaries China and Russia from attacking or threatening our  national interests; and mandates reforms to make the Pentagon more  efficient, innovative, and cost-effective.  In the legislation there are significant bipartisan provisions to  strengthen our posture on artificial intelligence and cybersecurity and  to fortify our alliance with NATO and our security relationship with  Israel.  With the passage of the FY2021 NDAA, expectant mothers in the  military could receive free loaner maternity uniforms because the  legislation directs the Department of Defense to conduct a pilot  program to issue maternity uniforms and related items to pregnant  military members on a temporary and as-needed basis.  Madam Speaker, this is important because women make up about 21  percent of the Air Force; 20.2 percent of the Navy; 15.4 percent of the  Army; and 9 percent of the Marine Corps.  Also, the FY2021 NDAA makes needed reforms to prevent sexual assault,  a matter of great importance to the public and my colleagues,  particularly those of us from Texas, where Fort Hood is located and  where Army Specialist Vanessa Guillen was murdered to prevent her from  reporting the sexual harassment and abuse she suffered from her direct  superior in the chain of command.  I am very grateful to Congressman Brown of Maryland, himself a  veteran of the Armed Services, for his leadership in ensuring the NDAA  authorize and approve the renaming of military bases currently named  for persons who took up arms for the Confederacy and against the United  States.  I am very pleased that included in the legislation is my language  directing the consideration be given to distinguished and heroic  African-American and Native American servicemembers in the renaming of  military bases.  Removing the stain of bases and military installations being name for  confederate traitors is an act of profound reconciliation and healing.  For too long African Americans servicemembers have been forced to  tolerate the hidden racism that existed under the guise of the rebel  flag, knowing through oral history the brutality of those who  voluntarily fought for the Confederacy.  The FY2021 NDAA ushers in a new enlightened era where the names of  traitors who took up arms against the United States will have their  names removed from places of honor such as military bases or  installations.  These individuals will not be forgotten; instead they will have a  permanent place in history and their records will be studied and  examined in full by historians and scholars.  Madam Speaker, it is also fitting that FY2021 NDAA directs the  Department of Defense to take concrete actions to recognize and  memorialize the contributions made by African Americans and Native  Americans servicemembers in defense of our nation.  The history of African Americans and Native Americans serving in the  military date back to the colonial period of our nation to the present  day.  In every war waged from the Battle of Lexington to the Battle for  Fallujah, African Americans and Native Americans have honorably  answered the call to duty, and served with great valor and distinction  in America's armed forces.  At decisive moments in our nation's history, the United States  military and its citizens warriors answered the call and were decisive  in the nation's epic battles for freedom and liberty, including:  Revolutionary War (1776-1783); War of 1812 (1812-1814); Mexican- American War (1836); Civil War (1861-1865); Spanish-American War  (1898); World War I (1914-1918); World War II (1941-1945); Korean War  (1950-1953); Vietnam War (1965-1975); Gulf War (1991); and Operations  Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, as well as conflicts in other  theaters of war. [["", Page , H9162, ]  The military was there doing a job no other branch of our nation's  government could do--in the face of overwhelming danger--when the fate  of the American Experiment was on the line.  Our thanks to the military for always answering the call of duty-- whether that call comes in the dead of night or the light of day--we  know that we can count on you.  The names and faces of millions of African Americans who have served  our nation in uniform may fade from memory, but today we have the  opportunity to remember and see them in the faces of the young men and  women who preserved freedom in the world, even at a time when the  blessings of liberty were denied to them at home.  The Jackson Lee provision in the FY2021 NDAA recognizes that there is  no shortage of distinguished veterans, and especially African American  and Native American veterans, who are worthy of the honor of naming a  military facility in their honor.  Let me provide for the record some representative candidates.  UNITED STATES ARMY  General Roscoe Robinson Jr., the first black four-star general in the  Army and 1951 West Point graduate who attended the service academy  before the Army was desegregated and served in Korea and Vietnam, with  valor decorations in both conflicts, and as a training officer as part  of the U.S. military support mission in Liberia. He went on to become  the first black commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, deputy chief  of staff for operations in U.S. Army Europe, commander of U.S. Forces  Japan, the U.S. representative on the NATO Military Committee.  William Harvey Carney was the first African American recipient of the  Congressional Medal of Honor, which he received for his actions on July  18, 1863 at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, while a member of the 54th  Massachusetts Regiment in the Civil War--the state's first all-black  regiment.  The 54th Massachusetts was the subject of the film, ``Glory,''  starring Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman.  Lieutenant Colonel Charity Edna Adams was appointed to lead the  African American Women's Army Corps unit designated as the 6888th  Central Postal Directory Battalion, which became known as the ``Six  Triple Eight.''  The ``Six Triple Eight'' unit was instrumental in establishing and  maintaining morale because it assured that mail from the battlefront  and the home-front flowed efficiently and timely.  Lt. Col. Margaret E. Bailey of the Army Nurse Corps was the first  nurse to be promoted to lieutenant colonel.  UNITED STATES NAVY  Messman First Class Dorie Miller was serving in a noncombat role in  the Navy, when he acted heroically to defend lives after his ship, the  USS West Virginia was attacked at Pearl Harbor.  He was the first African American to be awarded the Navy Cross, the  third highest honor awarded by the United States Navy at the time.  Admiral Michelle Howard is a four-star Admiral and one of the  highest-ranking African American women ever to serve in any branch of  the military. Admiral Howard is also the first African American woman  to command a U.S. naval vessel, the USS Rushmore.  She is the Navy's second highest ranking officer and is currently  serving as the commander of U.S. Naval Forces Africa, commander of U.S.  Naval Forces Europe, and commander of Allied Joint Force Command  Naples.  UNITED STATES AIR FORCE  In 2012, Lieutenant Colonel Shawna Rochelle-Kimbrell became the first  female African American fighter pilot in the Air Force history and her  flights in Northern Watch marked her as the first female pilot to fly  combat missions for Misawa's 35th Fighter Wing and the first African  American woman to employ ordinance in combat. She has logged more than  1,110 hours in the F-16, including 176 hours of combat time.  Colonel Ruth A. Lucas was the first African American woman in the Air  Force to be promoted to the rank of colonel. At the time of her  retirement in 1970, she was the highest-ranking African American woman  in the Air Force.  In 1959 General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. became the first African  American Major General in the United States Air Force. As the organizer  and commander of famed 332nd Fighter Group known as the Tuskegee  Airmen, his place in history will be forever remembered and revered.  General Davis received many decorations during his career, including  two Distinguished Service Medals and a Silver Star and on December 9,  1998, General Davis was awarded his fourth general's star by President  Bill Clinton.  UNITED STATES COAST GUARD  Chief Petty Officer Alex Haley is best known for writing letters for  his shipmates and his short stories and articles, which got him  promoted to Chief Journalist of the Coast Guard in 1959.  Haley ultimately received a number of military honors, including the  American Defense Service Medal, World War II Victory Medal and an  honorary degree from the Coast Guard Academy but most of you know him  also as the author of ``Roots,'' the path-breaking and epic retracing  of a family's history from the Gambian coast in Africa to the New World  in America.  In 1957, Captain Bobby Wilks became the first African American Coast  Guard aviator. He later became the first African American to reach the  rank of Captain and the first to command a Coast Guard air station. He  accumulated over 6,000 flight hours in 18 different types of aircrafts.  Madam Speaker, 25 percent of the today's active duty military is  comprised of persons of color, of which 17.8 percent are African  American.  This percentage outpaces the percentage of African Americans in the  general population (13 percent) but lagging significantly is the 9% of  African Americans in the commissioned officer ranks.  NATIVE AMERICANS  The Jackson Lee Amendment offered during House consideration of the  NDAA was expanded to include Native Americans.  It is without doubt that the military has a storied history of Native  American contributions to the securing our nation since colonial times  to the present.  One famous example of their contributions occurred during World War  II when the U.S. military developed a specific policy to recruit and  train Navajo speakers to become ``code talkers.''  Code Talker is the name given to 29 Navajo Natives who used their  tribal language to send secret communications on the battlefield.  The Marines formed the Navajo Code Talkers, who created a code based  on the complex, unwritten Navajo language.  The code primarily used word association by assigning a Navajo word  to key phrases and military tactics.  This system enabled the Code Talkers to translate three lines of  English in 20 seconds, not 30 minutes as was common with existing  codebreaking machines.  The Code Talkers participated in every major Marine operation in the  Pacific theater, giving the Marines a critical advantage throughout the  war.  During the nearly month-long battle for Iwo Jima, for example, six  Navajo Code Talker Marines successfully transmitted more than 800  messages without error.  Marine leadership noted after the battle that the Code Talkers were  critical to the victory at Iwo Jima.  The Navajo Code was never broken.  Our Native American brothers and sisters are more than worthy to be  so honored by having their names considered for military bases and  installations.  BOOGALOO AND PROUD BOYS  Another Jackson Lee Amendment included in the House version of the  NDAA directed the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress the  extent, if any, of the threat to national security posed by domestic  terrorist groups and organizations motivated by a belief system of  white supremacy, such as extremist groups like the Boogaloo Boys and  the Proud Boys, is reflected in the Conference bill.  The concern is that in the aftermath of a historic national election,  the activity of violence influencers like Boogaloo Boys or Proud Boys  will increase and lead to attacks becoming more frequent.  We have witnessed too many instances of violent extremists searching  for opportunities to sow violence and disrupt democratic processes and  Boogaloo and Proud Boys are targeting constitutionally protected  activity to coopt or to provide cover for attacks.  Jackson Lee Amendment 179 implements a recommendation made by the  Cyberspace Solarium Commission to require the Secretary of Homeland  Security to develop a strategy to implement Domain-based Message  Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) standard across  U.S.-based email providers to increase the security of email,  The security of email has grown in importance as it has become in  many ways the primary way that businesses, consumers, government  communicate.  The Senate bill also addressed this important issue and the language  of the final Conference concurs.  For all these reasons, I urge all Members to join me in voting to  override the President's unwise and ill-considered veto of the William  M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2021.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered.  There was no objection.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Will the House, on  reconsideration, pass the bill, the objections [["", Page , H9163, ] of the President to the contrary notwithstanding?  Under the Constitution, the vote must be by the yeas and nays.  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question  will be postponed.    "
496,Christopher Smith,3.372398614883423,R,smith,smith," Ms. SMITH. Madam President, today I wish to recognize and celebrate  the lives of James Rogers, Charles Nord, and Kort Plantenberg, all  members of the Minnesota National Guard, who tragically lost their  lives in a helicopter accident on Thursday, December 5. After returning  home safely from deployment to the Middle East in May, this loss is  especially heart wrenching. These men conducted medical evacuations in  the Middle East, and their service to our troops and allies will not be  forgotten. I am grateful for their service and sacrifice for Minnesota  and our country.  CW2 James Rogers, often remembered for his curious nature, served 10  years in the Minnesota National Guard, having enlisted before his high  school graduation. CW2 Charles Nord enlisted in 2007, and he leaves  behind his wife, young daughter, and a child on the way. SGT James  Plantenberg enlisted in 2016, was a member of the Guard's biathlon  team, and was preparing to start flight school. We are all indebted to  these men for their service, and I wish their families peace during  this time of tragic loss.    "
497,Christopher Smith,3.372398614883423,R,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for  yielding. I thank Mr. Wilson for his great work, and I want to thank my  distinguished colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Eliot Engel and  Michael McCaul. Thank you for your support in helping to get this  legislation to the floor. I thank Chairman Keating, as well.  Mr. Speaker, I urge swift enactment into law of this bipartisan bill  called the Belarus Democracy Human Rights and Sovereignty Act of 2020,  which I have introduced.  And here is why this legislation is absolutely needed right now; not  next year, not when we come back, hopefully the Senate will take it up  if it passes today, and I think it will, but we need this right now.  Many of my colleagues know, and perhaps they know it well, that  Belarus was perhaps the nation most mired in the Soviet past, with an  inefficient economy and a strongman autocrat, really a dictator, in  charge for over two and a half decades, Alexander Lukashenko. Yet the  indomitable spirit of freedom stirred among the people of Belarus, and  when a patently false election--another one--was announced on August 9  declaring Lukashenko the winner, the people took to the streets. And  they are still on the streets today.  The OSCE Moscow Mechanism reported November 5 that there is  ``'overwhelming' evidence that Belarus' August 9 presidential election  results were falsified and as `systematic' human rights violations have  been committed by the country's security forces in response to the  peaceful demonstrations that the vote sparked.''  Now, reports out of Belarus indicate that police are using  increasingly violent tactics against these peaceful protesters.  The BBC summed it up yesterday in an article titled, ``Belarus  protesters battered, bruised, but defiant after 100 days,'' which said  in part, ``opposition protesters remain defiant in Belarus despite  police brutality, 100 days after they first took to the streets to  denounce the reelection of President Alexander Lukashenko. Police in  helmets and body armour throw women holding flowers and balloons into  police vans.''  And, of course, then it only gets worse. ``Officers tear-gas elderly  people on a pensioners' march. . . .  ``Yet every Sunday thousands still pour into the streets of the  capital Minsk, condemning what they see as Mr. Lukashenko's fraudulent  9 August victory. . . . `'  There is a report that points out, again a BBC report, ``Alesya, a  31-year-old worker in the IT industry, regularly attends the Sunday  rallies. On 15 November, however, things turned nasty very quickly.  ``When she arrived at the square,'' she said, ``where the march was  supposed to start, it was already packed with security forces. As more  people gathered, officers fired stun grenades and started hitting  people with batons to disperse the crowd.  ``They attacked us again and again. It was awful. They ferociously  beat people, twisted their arms and took them away.  ``She ran away into one of the courtyards following other protesters,  but police in their minivans quickly caught up with them even there.  She was saved,'' she goes on, ``by a stranger who hid her and several  others in his house.''  {time} 1530  She goes on to say, ``It was like World War II, when people tried to  hide Jews from the Nazis. It was terrifying, we were shocked.''  That particular march was called in memory of Roman Bondarenko, an  activist who was so severely beaten while in detention, that he died in  the hospital just last week.  Mr. Speaker, the Congress can and we must do our part in this crisis.  The people of Belarus, especially the pro-democracy leaders,  desperately need our help, and they need it right now.  As my colleagues know, the leading opposition presidential candidate,  Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya, almost certainly won the election in August.  She went on to form the Coordination Council.  The democratic opposition is united, it is smart, it is principled,  tenacious, and it is extraordinarily brave.  Ms. Tsikhanouskaya ran a courageous campaign, but today is in exile  in Lithuania, in Vilnius, where she continues to rally the Belarusian  people and the world and demand that democracy and human rights for all  people be given to her nation.  A couple weeks ago I read portions of a transcript of a hearing I  chaired in 2011 after another fraudulent Belarusian election put  Lukashenko back in power. Then as now, and on so many other occasions,  Lukashenko's bullies beat, jailed, assaulted, tortured, raped, and  killed peaceful protesters, but now it is going on right as we meet  here today as never before.  The big mistake of the past, fatigue or lack of commitment and  perseverance by the international community, can't be repeated this  time. We can't be outraged at first and then turn the page and say,  ``Now what?''  We need to have a determined effort to help these people who are  struggling for democracy and human rights in their nation.  On two separate occasions, I would note parenthetically, I met with  Lukashenko in Minsk and came away resolved to accelerate the struggle  for democracy and freedom.  I was with a group of 11 Members, including some of our members on  the committee, and he pointed to me, because I am the author of the  Belarus Democracy Act of 2004, and said, ``There is public enemy number  one.''  That is how he thinks. Anybody who aspires for freedom and democracy,  particularly against his brutal regime, is construed to be a public  enemy. And for the people of Belarus, they go to jail, where they are  beaten senselessly.  Our bipartisan bill, "", H.R. 8438, "", again, cosponsored by Mr. Engel, Mr.  McCaul, Mr. Keating, Mr. Kinzinger, and so many other Members of this  House, updates, strengthens, and expands the Belarus Democracy Acts of  2004, 2006, and 2011, laws that I also authored, and renews the  personal, economic, and visa sanctions on an expanded list of actors in  the Belarusian Government, and now for the first time on Russian  individuals complicit in this crackdown.  I would note parenthetically, the Magnitsky Act, the idea of  personally sanctioning with visa denial as well as economic sanctions  on individuals that led to the Global Magnitsky Act came out of the  Belarus Democracy Act of 2004.  So it is an idea, it is a method of holding those who commit these  abuses personally accountable.  When you sanction an entire nation, that has an impact, but innocent  people do get hurt. This sanctions the individuals who are perpetrators  of these heinous crimes.  Yesterday, Svetlana again called for the sanctions, just yesterday  for the sanctions that are embedded in our bill. So the time to act is  now.  The bill also has other provisions. It does call for new elections.  It recognizes the Coordination Council as a legitimate institution to  participate in a dialogue on a peaceful transition of power. They are  the ones we need to be talking to.  It calls for the release of all political prisoners, and that number  rises by the day.  It supports the aspirations of the people to exercise their religious  freedom. There has been a crackdown there as well.  It authorizes assistance to promote democracy in civil society in  Belarus. On occasions in Minsk, I have met with those individuals. They  are brave beyond words, because they always know somebody is lurking-- the secret police--just waiting to haul them off to prison.  It unequivocally states that it is the policy of the U.S. ``not to  recognize any incorporation of Belarus into a `Union State' with  Russia.'' Russia is using this crisis as a pretext to further manifest  their monopoly of power. They would love--like they did in parts of  Ukraine, South Ossetia, Abkhazia--to just take the whole of Belarus  into their national boundary.  The bill requires the U.S. strategy to promote broadcasting, internet  freedom, and access to information. [["", Page , H5920, ]  In addition, it gives much needed support to the Belarusian media and  to the IT sector.  By passing this bill today followed by, hopefully, swift approval in  the Senate and signature into law by the President, we not only  reiterate, but significantly expand our support and solidarity with the  great people of Belarus. We need to pass this bill and I respectfully  call on our Senate colleagues to pass it as well.    "
498,Christopher Smith,3.372398614883423,R,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of "", H.R. 2477, "", which includes  some legislation to improve Medicare coverage for kidney transplant  recipients.  The Trump administration has made increasing rates of kidney  transplantation a priority. It is more cost-effective than dialysis and  results in a dramatic increase in the quality of life for ESRD  patients. However, these patients must continue taking medication for  the remainder of their life so that they don't reject their organs.  Currently, Medicare will only cover the cost of these drugs for 36  months after a kidney transplant. Patients who do not have health  insurance or lose their insurance coverage have to choose between  paying thousands of dollars a month out of pocket or risk the chance of  rejection of their organs.  If organ rejection does occur, these patients must once again endure  the painful, time-consuming, and expensive dialysis treatments paid for  by the Medicare program. By simply paying for the cost of these drugs  and preventing patients from crashing back into dialysis, the Federal  Government [["", Page , H6999, ] can save hundreds of millions of dollars and improve thousands of  lives.  We should not allow such unnecessary waste and suffering to occur.  These Americans should not have to worry about how they will afford the  cost of the medications that allow them to live a completely normal  life.  Madam Speaker, I thank Representatives Kind and Burgess for their  leadership and for working together on this commonsense bipartisan  bill.  Madam Speaker, I urge the House to pass ', H.R. 2477, '.    "
499,Christopher Smith,3.372398614883423,R,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Steve  Nelson, a corn and soybean farmer from Axtell, Nebraska, on his  retirement as president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau.  The Nebraska Farm Bureau is a leading voice for Nebraska agriculture  producers because of its hardworking members and leaders like Steve,  whose hard work and leadership have made the Third District of Nebraska  the top-producing agriculture district in America.  Steve has served as president through the completion of two farm  bills, ensuring the needs of Nebraska producers are reflected and met  throughout the process--no small task.  I have appreciated Steve's persistence in the face of many challenges  we have faced in Nebraska recently, especially the historic floods,  storms, the irrigation tunnel collapse, and certainly other  uncertainties. Those affected, though, were always able to turn to the  Nebraska Farm Bureau.  I would like to thank Steve for his great work, and I wish him well  as he continues as a farm producer at home and advocating for our  State's farmers and ranchers.    "
500,Christopher Smith,3.372398614883423,R,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  I rise to strongly urge Members to uphold what we did in this Chamber  just a couple weeks ago and what the Senate did, as well; and that is  we passed an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill, with roughly 80 percent of  the vote in both the Senate and the House.  The legislative branch made it absolutely clear that we support this  piece of legislation, and as the gentleman from Texas just noted, we  support it with very good reason.  It is enormously important to give our troops the support that they  need to carry out the job that we all are asking them to do. That is, I  think, one of our minimum obligations as Members of Congress. And this  bill reflects that.  This bill is the process of a lengthy effort involving Members of  both Chambers, both parties, that have come together and put together  an incredibly strong piece of legislation. That is why it passed so  overwhelmingly just a couple weeks ago. And nothing has changed.  Nothing has changed. The bill is exactly the same and every little bit  as important.  Now, the President has the right to veto it, but I think we, as  Members of [["", Page , H9161, ] the legislative body, have to look at the reason behind that. Was it  because of something in the bill?  Pieces of legislation come through here all the time, and we  occasionally miss something. The President finds out, and we say: Gosh,  I didn't know that. That is not what happened here.  I really want Members to understand the President vetoed this because  of something that isn't in the bill and was never going to be in the  bill, something totally unrelated to national security and something  that we were not going to do in any event.  There is literally no reason to veto this bill for the reasons that  the President did and certainly no reason for us not to uphold what we  did in passing this bill. This is really important that we exercise our  legislative prerogative.  There are all kinds of crucial provisions in this bill, but I will  just point to one, and that is the one that Mr. Thornberry mentioned  earlier, to give you an idea of why it is important that the  legislative branch do its job in exercising oversight of the Department  of Defense in providing national security policy, and that is the cyber  issue.  Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Langevin, chairman of the  subcommittee that deals with this issue, and Ranking Member Stefanik,  they have worked together to really put together an incredible package  to try to better address these very cyber issues that we are now  facing. That is what we do in this legislation, and it is not always  exciting, but it is incredibly important to meet our obligation to our  troops and to the national security of this country.  It is enormously important that we pass this bill. We did it once.  Let's just do it one more time, and then we can all go home for the  year. We can be done, and we can be proud of what we have accomplished.  I urge Members to vote in favor of this bill to do what we did just a  couple weeks ago. Show the country that the legislative branch can  still do its job.  I will close on one note, which we make a lot of times.  {time} 1700  This is the most bipartisan committee in Congress. That is not an  easy thing to achieve. We have a lot of things that we passionately  disagree about in this body, and we should, but on the Armed Services  bill, we manage to come together. It is not always easy, but we get it  done.  I think it is enormously important that we let the country know that  that process hasn't died. We put together a product, a bipartisan,  bicameral product that has gotten an overwhelming number of votes.  Let's show the American public that the legislative process works at  least a little bit better than sometimes they think it does, that we  can get our job done and, in this case, get our job done for the men  and women who put their lives on the line to protect this country. We  owe them nothing less than that.  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees  on the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, I rise in  strong opposition to the Administration's seemingly callous veto of the  William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2021 and proudly announce my intention to vote to override  this reckless veto.  I take this action because I disagree with the President that  preserving monuments and memorials and naming military installations  for the defenders of slavery who took up arms against the United States  to achieve their aims is more important and a higher priority than  providing the funding, resources, and support to the nation's military  and civilian defense person, one of the nation's most respected  institutions and its most diverse and representative.  Other than his pique at being on the short end of what is by his own  account an Electoral College landslide and being routed by seven  million votes in his failed bid for reelection, there is absolutely no  basis for the erstwhile Commander-in-Chief to veto the bipartisan NDAA  and deny our servicemembers a long-overdue pay raise and hazard duty  pay many of whom live in or are from my congressional district.  It is cruel, shameful, and heartless for a Commander-in-Chief to deny  to more than 100,000 federal employees the paid family leave child  care, housing and health protections authorized by the FY2021 NDAA or  to withhold from our veterans the benefits that they need and deserve.  The FY2021 NDAA Conference Report, negotiated under the careful  stewardship of Chairman Adam Smith of Washington and Ranking Member Mac  Thornberry in the House and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman  James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Ranking Member Jack Reed of Rhode Island  is carefully crafted, exemplary legislation reflecting the nation's  sacred commitment to those who willingly risk their lives, fortunes,  and sacred honor to keep our nation safe and preserve, protect, and  defend the Constitution.  The FY21 NDAA provides a long-sought after benefit for tens of  thousands of Vietnam-era veterans who are struggling with certain  health complications after being exposed to Agent Orange while serving  their country.  In addition, the legislation authorizes $8.4 billion in military  construction projects to fortify critical infrastructure and base  realignment and closure clean up, it contains important new tools to  deter adversaries China and Russia from attacking or threatening our  national interests; and mandates reforms to make the Pentagon more  efficient, innovative, and cost-effective.  In the legislation there are significant bipartisan provisions to  strengthen our posture on artificial intelligence and cybersecurity and  to fortify our alliance with NATO and our security relationship with  Israel.  With the passage of the FY2021 NDAA, expectant mothers in the  military could receive free loaner maternity uniforms because the  legislation directs the Department of Defense to conduct a pilot  program to issue maternity uniforms and related items to pregnant  military members on a temporary and as-needed basis.  Madam Speaker, this is important because women make up about 21  percent of the Air Force; 20.2 percent of the Navy; 15.4 percent of the  Army; and 9 percent of the Marine Corps.  Also, the FY2021 NDAA makes needed reforms to prevent sexual assault,  a matter of great importance to the public and my colleagues,  particularly those of us from Texas, where Fort Hood is located and  where Army Specialist Vanessa Guillen was murdered to prevent her from  reporting the sexual harassment and abuse she suffered from her direct  superior in the chain of command.  I am very grateful to Congressman Brown of Maryland, himself a  veteran of the Armed Services, for his leadership in ensuring the NDAA  authorize and approve the renaming of military bases currently named  for persons who took up arms for the Confederacy and against the United  States.  I am very pleased that included in the legislation is my language  directing the consideration be given to distinguished and heroic  African-American and Native American servicemembers in the renaming of  military bases.  Removing the stain of bases and military installations being name for  confederate traitors is an act of profound reconciliation and healing.  For too long African Americans servicemembers have been forced to  tolerate the hidden racism that existed under the guise of the rebel  flag, knowing through oral history the brutality of those who  voluntarily fought for the Confederacy.  The FY2021 NDAA ushers in a new enlightened era where the names of  traitors who took up arms against the United States will have their  names removed from places of honor such as military bases or  installations.  These individuals will not be forgotten; instead they will have a  permanent place in history and their records will be studied and  examined in full by historians and scholars.  Madam Speaker, it is also fitting that FY2021 NDAA directs the  Department of Defense to take concrete actions to recognize and  memorialize the contributions made by African Americans and Native  Americans servicemembers in defense of our nation.  The history of African Americans and Native Americans serving in the  military date back to the colonial period of our nation to the present  day.  In every war waged from the Battle of Lexington to the Battle for  Fallujah, African Americans and Native Americans have honorably  answered the call to duty, and served with great valor and distinction  in America's armed forces.  At decisive moments in our nation's history, the United States  military and its citizens warriors answered the call and were decisive  in the nation's epic battles for freedom and liberty, including:  Revolutionary War (1776-1783); War of 1812 (1812-1814); Mexican- American War (1836); Civil War (1861-1865); Spanish-American War  (1898); World War I (1914-1918); World War II (1941-1945); Korean War  (1950-1953); Vietnam War (1965-1975); Gulf War (1991); and Operations  Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, as well as conflicts in other  theaters of war. [["", Page , H9162, ]  The military was there doing a job no other branch of our nation's  government could do--in the face of overwhelming danger--when the fate  of the American Experiment was on the line.  Our thanks to the military for always answering the call of duty-- whether that call comes in the dead of night or the light of day--we  know that we can count on you.  The names and faces of millions of African Americans who have served  our nation in uniform may fade from memory, but today we have the  opportunity to remember and see them in the faces of the young men and  women who preserved freedom in the world, even at a time when the  blessings of liberty were denied to them at home.  The Jackson Lee provision in the FY2021 NDAA recognizes that there is  no shortage of distinguished veterans, and especially African American  and Native American veterans, who are worthy of the honor of naming a  military facility in their honor.  Let me provide for the record some representative candidates.  UNITED STATES ARMY  General Roscoe Robinson Jr., the first black four-star general in the  Army and 1951 West Point graduate who attended the service academy  before the Army was desegregated and served in Korea and Vietnam, with  valor decorations in both conflicts, and as a training officer as part  of the U.S. military support mission in Liberia. He went on to become  the first black commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, deputy chief  of staff for operations in U.S. Army Europe, commander of U.S. Forces  Japan, the U.S. representative on the NATO Military Committee.  William Harvey Carney was the first African American recipient of the  Congressional Medal of Honor, which he received for his actions on July  18, 1863 at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, while a member of the 54th  Massachusetts Regiment in the Civil War--the state's first all-black  regiment.  The 54th Massachusetts was the subject of the film, ``Glory,''  starring Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman.  Lieutenant Colonel Charity Edna Adams was appointed to lead the  African American Women's Army Corps unit designated as the 6888th  Central Postal Directory Battalion, which became known as the ``Six  Triple Eight.''  The ``Six Triple Eight'' unit was instrumental in establishing and  maintaining morale because it assured that mail from the battlefront  and the home-front flowed efficiently and timely.  Lt. Col. Margaret E. Bailey of the Army Nurse Corps was the first  nurse to be promoted to lieutenant colonel.  UNITED STATES NAVY  Messman First Class Dorie Miller was serving in a noncombat role in  the Navy, when he acted heroically to defend lives after his ship, the  USS West Virginia was attacked at Pearl Harbor.  He was the first African American to be awarded the Navy Cross, the  third highest honor awarded by the United States Navy at the time.  Admiral Michelle Howard is a four-star Admiral and one of the  highest-ranking African American women ever to serve in any branch of  the military. Admiral Howard is also the first African American woman  to command a U.S. naval vessel, the USS Rushmore.  She is the Navy's second highest ranking officer and is currently  serving as the commander of U.S. Naval Forces Africa, commander of U.S.  Naval Forces Europe, and commander of Allied Joint Force Command  Naples.  UNITED STATES AIR FORCE  In 2012, Lieutenant Colonel Shawna Rochelle-Kimbrell became the first  female African American fighter pilot in the Air Force history and her  flights in Northern Watch marked her as the first female pilot to fly  combat missions for Misawa's 35th Fighter Wing and the first African  American woman to employ ordinance in combat. She has logged more than  1,110 hours in the F-16, including 176 hours of combat time.  Colonel Ruth A. Lucas was the first African American woman in the Air  Force to be promoted to the rank of colonel. At the time of her  retirement in 1970, she was the highest-ranking African American woman  in the Air Force.  In 1959 General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. became the first African  American Major General in the United States Air Force. As the organizer  and commander of famed 332nd Fighter Group known as the Tuskegee  Airmen, his place in history will be forever remembered and revered.  General Davis received many decorations during his career, including  two Distinguished Service Medals and a Silver Star and on December 9,  1998, General Davis was awarded his fourth general's star by President  Bill Clinton.  UNITED STATES COAST GUARD  Chief Petty Officer Alex Haley is best known for writing letters for  his shipmates and his short stories and articles, which got him  promoted to Chief Journalist of the Coast Guard in 1959.  Haley ultimately received a number of military honors, including the  American Defense Service Medal, World War II Victory Medal and an  honorary degree from the Coast Guard Academy but most of you know him  also as the author of ``Roots,'' the path-breaking and epic retracing  of a family's history from the Gambian coast in Africa to the New World  in America.  In 1957, Captain Bobby Wilks became the first African American Coast  Guard aviator. He later became the first African American to reach the  rank of Captain and the first to command a Coast Guard air station. He  accumulated over 6,000 flight hours in 18 different types of aircrafts.  Madam Speaker, 25 percent of the today's active duty military is  comprised of persons of color, of which 17.8 percent are African  American.  This percentage outpaces the percentage of African Americans in the  general population (13 percent) but lagging significantly is the 9% of  African Americans in the commissioned officer ranks.  NATIVE AMERICANS  The Jackson Lee Amendment offered during House consideration of the  NDAA was expanded to include Native Americans.  It is without doubt that the military has a storied history of Native  American contributions to the securing our nation since colonial times  to the present.  One famous example of their contributions occurred during World War  II when the U.S. military developed a specific policy to recruit and  train Navajo speakers to become ``code talkers.''  Code Talker is the name given to 29 Navajo Natives who used their  tribal language to send secret communications on the battlefield.  The Marines formed the Navajo Code Talkers, who created a code based  on the complex, unwritten Navajo language.  The code primarily used word association by assigning a Navajo word  to key phrases and military tactics.  This system enabled the Code Talkers to translate three lines of  English in 20 seconds, not 30 minutes as was common with existing  codebreaking machines.  The Code Talkers participated in every major Marine operation in the  Pacific theater, giving the Marines a critical advantage throughout the  war.  During the nearly month-long battle for Iwo Jima, for example, six  Navajo Code Talker Marines successfully transmitted more than 800  messages without error.  Marine leadership noted after the battle that the Code Talkers were  critical to the victory at Iwo Jima.  The Navajo Code was never broken.  Our Native American brothers and sisters are more than worthy to be  so honored by having their names considered for military bases and  installations.  BOOGALOO AND PROUD BOYS  Another Jackson Lee Amendment included in the House version of the  NDAA directed the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress the  extent, if any, of the threat to national security posed by domestic  terrorist groups and organizations motivated by a belief system of  white supremacy, such as extremist groups like the Boogaloo Boys and  the Proud Boys, is reflected in the Conference bill.  The concern is that in the aftermath of a historic national election,  the activity of violence influencers like Boogaloo Boys or Proud Boys  will increase and lead to attacks becoming more frequent.  We have witnessed too many instances of violent extremists searching  for opportunities to sow violence and disrupt democratic processes and  Boogaloo and Proud Boys are targeting constitutionally protected  activity to coopt or to provide cover for attacks.  Jackson Lee Amendment 179 implements a recommendation made by the  Cyberspace Solarium Commission to require the Secretary of Homeland  Security to develop a strategy to implement Domain-based Message  Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) standard across  U.S.-based email providers to increase the security of email,  The security of email has grown in importance as it has become in  many ways the primary way that businesses, consumers, government  communicate.  The Senate bill also addressed this important issue and the language  of the final Conference concurs.  For all these reasons, I urge all Members to join me in voting to  override the President's unwise and ill-considered veto of the William  M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2021.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered.  There was no objection.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Will the House, on  reconsideration, pass the bill, the objections [["", Page , H9163, ] of the President to the contrary notwithstanding?  Under the Constitution, the vote must be by the yeas and nays.  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question  will be postponed.    "
501,Jason Smith,0.17892244458198547,R,smith,smith," Ms. SMITH. Madam President, today I wish to recognize and celebrate  the lives of James Rogers, Charles Nord, and Kort Plantenberg, all  members of the Minnesota National Guard, who tragically lost their  lives in a helicopter accident on Thursday, December 5. After returning  home safely from deployment to the Middle East in May, this loss is  especially heart wrenching. These men conducted medical evacuations in  the Middle East, and their service to our troops and allies will not be  forgotten. I am grateful for their service and sacrifice for Minnesota  and our country.  CW2 James Rogers, often remembered for his curious nature, served 10  years in the Minnesota National Guard, having enlisted before his high  school graduation. CW2 Charles Nord enlisted in 2007, and he leaves  behind his wife, young daughter, and a child on the way. SGT James  Plantenberg enlisted in 2016, was a member of the Guard's biathlon  team, and was preparing to start flight school. We are all indebted to  these men for their service, and I wish their families peace during  this time of tragic loss.    "
502,Jason Smith,0.17892244458198547,R,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for  yielding. I thank Mr. Wilson for his great work, and I want to thank my  distinguished colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Eliot Engel and  Michael McCaul. Thank you for your support in helping to get this  legislation to the floor. I thank Chairman Keating, as well.  Mr. Speaker, I urge swift enactment into law of this bipartisan bill  called the Belarus Democracy Human Rights and Sovereignty Act of 2020,  which I have introduced.  And here is why this legislation is absolutely needed right now; not  next year, not when we come back, hopefully the Senate will take it up  if it passes today, and I think it will, but we need this right now.  Many of my colleagues know, and perhaps they know it well, that  Belarus was perhaps the nation most mired in the Soviet past, with an  inefficient economy and a strongman autocrat, really a dictator, in  charge for over two and a half decades, Alexander Lukashenko. Yet the  indomitable spirit of freedom stirred among the people of Belarus, and  when a patently false election--another one--was announced on August 9  declaring Lukashenko the winner, the people took to the streets. And  they are still on the streets today.  The OSCE Moscow Mechanism reported November 5 that there is  ``'overwhelming' evidence that Belarus' August 9 presidential election  results were falsified and as `systematic' human rights violations have  been committed by the country's security forces in response to the  peaceful demonstrations that the vote sparked.''  Now, reports out of Belarus indicate that police are using  increasingly violent tactics against these peaceful protesters.  The BBC summed it up yesterday in an article titled, ``Belarus  protesters battered, bruised, but defiant after 100 days,'' which said  in part, ``opposition protesters remain defiant in Belarus despite  police brutality, 100 days after they first took to the streets to  denounce the reelection of President Alexander Lukashenko. Police in  helmets and body armour throw women holding flowers and balloons into  police vans.''  And, of course, then it only gets worse. ``Officers tear-gas elderly  people on a pensioners' march. . . .  ``Yet every Sunday thousands still pour into the streets of the  capital Minsk, condemning what they see as Mr. Lukashenko's fraudulent  9 August victory. . . . `'  There is a report that points out, again a BBC report, ``Alesya, a  31-year-old worker in the IT industry, regularly attends the Sunday  rallies. On 15 November, however, things turned nasty very quickly.  ``When she arrived at the square,'' she said, ``where the march was  supposed to start, it was already packed with security forces. As more  people gathered, officers fired stun grenades and started hitting  people with batons to disperse the crowd.  ``They attacked us again and again. It was awful. They ferociously  beat people, twisted their arms and took them away.  ``She ran away into one of the courtyards following other protesters,  but police in their minivans quickly caught up with them even there.  She was saved,'' she goes on, ``by a stranger who hid her and several  others in his house.''  {time} 1530  She goes on to say, ``It was like World War II, when people tried to  hide Jews from the Nazis. It was terrifying, we were shocked.''  That particular march was called in memory of Roman Bondarenko, an  activist who was so severely beaten while in detention, that he died in  the hospital just last week.  Mr. Speaker, the Congress can and we must do our part in this crisis.  The people of Belarus, especially the pro-democracy leaders,  desperately need our help, and they need it right now.  As my colleagues know, the leading opposition presidential candidate,  Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya, almost certainly won the election in August.  She went on to form the Coordination Council.  The democratic opposition is united, it is smart, it is principled,  tenacious, and it is extraordinarily brave.  Ms. Tsikhanouskaya ran a courageous campaign, but today is in exile  in Lithuania, in Vilnius, where she continues to rally the Belarusian  people and the world and demand that democracy and human rights for all  people be given to her nation.  A couple weeks ago I read portions of a transcript of a hearing I  chaired in 2011 after another fraudulent Belarusian election put  Lukashenko back in power. Then as now, and on so many other occasions,  Lukashenko's bullies beat, jailed, assaulted, tortured, raped, and  killed peaceful protesters, but now it is going on right as we meet  here today as never before.  The big mistake of the past, fatigue or lack of commitment and  perseverance by the international community, can't be repeated this  time. We can't be outraged at first and then turn the page and say,  ``Now what?''  We need to have a determined effort to help these people who are  struggling for democracy and human rights in their nation.  On two separate occasions, I would note parenthetically, I met with  Lukashenko in Minsk and came away resolved to accelerate the struggle  for democracy and freedom.  I was with a group of 11 Members, including some of our members on  the committee, and he pointed to me, because I am the author of the  Belarus Democracy Act of 2004, and said, ``There is public enemy number  one.''  That is how he thinks. Anybody who aspires for freedom and democracy,  particularly against his brutal regime, is construed to be a public  enemy. And for the people of Belarus, they go to jail, where they are  beaten senselessly.  Our bipartisan bill, "", H.R. 8438, "", again, cosponsored by Mr. Engel, Mr.  McCaul, Mr. Keating, Mr. Kinzinger, and so many other Members of this  House, updates, strengthens, and expands the Belarus Democracy Acts of  2004, 2006, and 2011, laws that I also authored, and renews the  personal, economic, and visa sanctions on an expanded list of actors in  the Belarusian Government, and now for the first time on Russian  individuals complicit in this crackdown.  I would note parenthetically, the Magnitsky Act, the idea of  personally sanctioning with visa denial as well as economic sanctions  on individuals that led to the Global Magnitsky Act came out of the  Belarus Democracy Act of 2004.  So it is an idea, it is a method of holding those who commit these  abuses personally accountable.  When you sanction an entire nation, that has an impact, but innocent  people do get hurt. This sanctions the individuals who are perpetrators  of these heinous crimes.  Yesterday, Svetlana again called for the sanctions, just yesterday  for the sanctions that are embedded in our bill. So the time to act is  now.  The bill also has other provisions. It does call for new elections.  It recognizes the Coordination Council as a legitimate institution to  participate in a dialogue on a peaceful transition of power. They are  the ones we need to be talking to.  It calls for the release of all political prisoners, and that number  rises by the day.  It supports the aspirations of the people to exercise their religious  freedom. There has been a crackdown there as well.  It authorizes assistance to promote democracy in civil society in  Belarus. On occasions in Minsk, I have met with those individuals. They  are brave beyond words, because they always know somebody is lurking-- the secret police--just waiting to haul them off to prison.  It unequivocally states that it is the policy of the U.S. ``not to  recognize any incorporation of Belarus into a `Union State' with  Russia.'' Russia is using this crisis as a pretext to further manifest  their monopoly of power. They would love--like they did in parts of  Ukraine, South Ossetia, Abkhazia--to just take the whole of Belarus  into their national boundary.  The bill requires the U.S. strategy to promote broadcasting, internet  freedom, and access to information. [["", Page , H5920, ]  In addition, it gives much needed support to the Belarusian media and  to the IT sector.  By passing this bill today followed by, hopefully, swift approval in  the Senate and signature into law by the President, we not only  reiterate, but significantly expand our support and solidarity with the  great people of Belarus. We need to pass this bill and I respectfully  call on our Senate colleagues to pass it as well.    "
503,Jason Smith,0.17892244458198547,R,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of "", H.R. 2477, "", which includes  some legislation to improve Medicare coverage for kidney transplant  recipients.  The Trump administration has made increasing rates of kidney  transplantation a priority. It is more cost-effective than dialysis and  results in a dramatic increase in the quality of life for ESRD  patients. However, these patients must continue taking medication for  the remainder of their life so that they don't reject their organs.  Currently, Medicare will only cover the cost of these drugs for 36  months after a kidney transplant. Patients who do not have health  insurance or lose their insurance coverage have to choose between  paying thousands of dollars a month out of pocket or risk the chance of  rejection of their organs.  If organ rejection does occur, these patients must once again endure  the painful, time-consuming, and expensive dialysis treatments paid for  by the Medicare program. By simply paying for the cost of these drugs  and preventing patients from crashing back into dialysis, the Federal  Government [["", Page , H6999, ] can save hundreds of millions of dollars and improve thousands of  lives.  We should not allow such unnecessary waste and suffering to occur.  These Americans should not have to worry about how they will afford the  cost of the medications that allow them to live a completely normal  life.  Madam Speaker, I thank Representatives Kind and Burgess for their  leadership and for working together on this commonsense bipartisan  bill.  Madam Speaker, I urge the House to pass ', H.R. 2477, '.    "
504,Jason Smith,0.17892244458198547,R,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Steve  Nelson, a corn and soybean farmer from Axtell, Nebraska, on his  retirement as president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau.  The Nebraska Farm Bureau is a leading voice for Nebraska agriculture  producers because of its hardworking members and leaders like Steve,  whose hard work and leadership have made the Third District of Nebraska  the top-producing agriculture district in America.  Steve has served as president through the completion of two farm  bills, ensuring the needs of Nebraska producers are reflected and met  throughout the process--no small task.  I have appreciated Steve's persistence in the face of many challenges  we have faced in Nebraska recently, especially the historic floods,  storms, the irrigation tunnel collapse, and certainly other  uncertainties. Those affected, though, were always able to turn to the  Nebraska Farm Bureau.  I would like to thank Steve for his great work, and I wish him well  as he continues as a farm producer at home and advocating for our  State's farmers and ranchers.    "
505,Jason Smith,0.17892244458198547,R,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  I rise to strongly urge Members to uphold what we did in this Chamber  just a couple weeks ago and what the Senate did, as well; and that is  we passed an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill, with roughly 80 percent of  the vote in both the Senate and the House.  The legislative branch made it absolutely clear that we support this  piece of legislation, and as the gentleman from Texas just noted, we  support it with very good reason.  It is enormously important to give our troops the support that they  need to carry out the job that we all are asking them to do. That is, I  think, one of our minimum obligations as Members of Congress. And this  bill reflects that.  This bill is the process of a lengthy effort involving Members of  both Chambers, both parties, that have come together and put together  an incredibly strong piece of legislation. That is why it passed so  overwhelmingly just a couple weeks ago. And nothing has changed.  Nothing has changed. The bill is exactly the same and every little bit  as important.  Now, the President has the right to veto it, but I think we, as  Members of [["", Page , H9161, ] the legislative body, have to look at the reason behind that. Was it  because of something in the bill?  Pieces of legislation come through here all the time, and we  occasionally miss something. The President finds out, and we say: Gosh,  I didn't know that. That is not what happened here.  I really want Members to understand the President vetoed this because  of something that isn't in the bill and was never going to be in the  bill, something totally unrelated to national security and something  that we were not going to do in any event.  There is literally no reason to veto this bill for the reasons that  the President did and certainly no reason for us not to uphold what we  did in passing this bill. This is really important that we exercise our  legislative prerogative.  There are all kinds of crucial provisions in this bill, but I will  just point to one, and that is the one that Mr. Thornberry mentioned  earlier, to give you an idea of why it is important that the  legislative branch do its job in exercising oversight of the Department  of Defense in providing national security policy, and that is the cyber  issue.  Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Langevin, chairman of the  subcommittee that deals with this issue, and Ranking Member Stefanik,  they have worked together to really put together an incredible package  to try to better address these very cyber issues that we are now  facing. That is what we do in this legislation, and it is not always  exciting, but it is incredibly important to meet our obligation to our  troops and to the national security of this country.  It is enormously important that we pass this bill. We did it once.  Let's just do it one more time, and then we can all go home for the  year. We can be done, and we can be proud of what we have accomplished.  I urge Members to vote in favor of this bill to do what we did just a  couple weeks ago. Show the country that the legislative branch can  still do its job.  I will close on one note, which we make a lot of times.  {time} 1700  This is the most bipartisan committee in Congress. That is not an  easy thing to achieve. We have a lot of things that we passionately  disagree about in this body, and we should, but on the Armed Services  bill, we manage to come together. It is not always easy, but we get it  done.  I think it is enormously important that we let the country know that  that process hasn't died. We put together a product, a bipartisan,  bicameral product that has gotten an overwhelming number of votes.  Let's show the American public that the legislative process works at  least a little bit better than sometimes they think it does, that we  can get our job done and, in this case, get our job done for the men  and women who put their lives on the line to protect this country. We  owe them nothing less than that.  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees  on the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, I rise in  strong opposition to the Administration's seemingly callous veto of the  William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2021 and proudly announce my intention to vote to override  this reckless veto.  I take this action because I disagree with the President that  preserving monuments and memorials and naming military installations  for the defenders of slavery who took up arms against the United States  to achieve their aims is more important and a higher priority than  providing the funding, resources, and support to the nation's military  and civilian defense person, one of the nation's most respected  institutions and its most diverse and representative.  Other than his pique at being on the short end of what is by his own  account an Electoral College landslide and being routed by seven  million votes in his failed bid for reelection, there is absolutely no  basis for the erstwhile Commander-in-Chief to veto the bipartisan NDAA  and deny our servicemembers a long-overdue pay raise and hazard duty  pay many of whom live in or are from my congressional district.  It is cruel, shameful, and heartless for a Commander-in-Chief to deny  to more than 100,000 federal employees the paid family leave child  care, housing and health protections authorized by the FY2021 NDAA or  to withhold from our veterans the benefits that they need and deserve.  The FY2021 NDAA Conference Report, negotiated under the careful  stewardship of Chairman Adam Smith of Washington and Ranking Member Mac  Thornberry in the House and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman  James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Ranking Member Jack Reed of Rhode Island  is carefully crafted, exemplary legislation reflecting the nation's  sacred commitment to those who willingly risk their lives, fortunes,  and sacred honor to keep our nation safe and preserve, protect, and  defend the Constitution.  The FY21 NDAA provides a long-sought after benefit for tens of  thousands of Vietnam-era veterans who are struggling with certain  health complications after being exposed to Agent Orange while serving  their country.  In addition, the legislation authorizes $8.4 billion in military  construction projects to fortify critical infrastructure and base  realignment and closure clean up, it contains important new tools to  deter adversaries China and Russia from attacking or threatening our  national interests; and mandates reforms to make the Pentagon more  efficient, innovative, and cost-effective.  In the legislation there are significant bipartisan provisions to  strengthen our posture on artificial intelligence and cybersecurity and  to fortify our alliance with NATO and our security relationship with  Israel.  With the passage of the FY2021 NDAA, expectant mothers in the  military could receive free loaner maternity uniforms because the  legislation directs the Department of Defense to conduct a pilot  program to issue maternity uniforms and related items to pregnant  military members on a temporary and as-needed basis.  Madam Speaker, this is important because women make up about 21  percent of the Air Force; 20.2 percent of the Navy; 15.4 percent of the  Army; and 9 percent of the Marine Corps.  Also, the FY2021 NDAA makes needed reforms to prevent sexual assault,  a matter of great importance to the public and my colleagues,  particularly those of us from Texas, where Fort Hood is located and  where Army Specialist Vanessa Guillen was murdered to prevent her from  reporting the sexual harassment and abuse she suffered from her direct  superior in the chain of command.  I am very grateful to Congressman Brown of Maryland, himself a  veteran of the Armed Services, for his leadership in ensuring the NDAA  authorize and approve the renaming of military bases currently named  for persons who took up arms for the Confederacy and against the United  States.  I am very pleased that included in the legislation is my language  directing the consideration be given to distinguished and heroic  African-American and Native American servicemembers in the renaming of  military bases.  Removing the stain of bases and military installations being name for  confederate traitors is an act of profound reconciliation and healing.  For too long African Americans servicemembers have been forced to  tolerate the hidden racism that existed under the guise of the rebel  flag, knowing through oral history the brutality of those who  voluntarily fought for the Confederacy.  The FY2021 NDAA ushers in a new enlightened era where the names of  traitors who took up arms against the United States will have their  names removed from places of honor such as military bases or  installations.  These individuals will not be forgotten; instead they will have a  permanent place in history and their records will be studied and  examined in full by historians and scholars.  Madam Speaker, it is also fitting that FY2021 NDAA directs the  Department of Defense to take concrete actions to recognize and  memorialize the contributions made by African Americans and Native  Americans servicemembers in defense of our nation.  The history of African Americans and Native Americans serving in the  military date back to the colonial period of our nation to the present  day.  In every war waged from the Battle of Lexington to the Battle for  Fallujah, African Americans and Native Americans have honorably  answered the call to duty, and served with great valor and distinction  in America's armed forces.  At decisive moments in our nation's history, the United States  military and its citizens warriors answered the call and were decisive  in the nation's epic battles for freedom and liberty, including:  Revolutionary War (1776-1783); War of 1812 (1812-1814); Mexican- American War (1836); Civil War (1861-1865); Spanish-American War  (1898); World War I (1914-1918); World War II (1941-1945); Korean War  (1950-1953); Vietnam War (1965-1975); Gulf War (1991); and Operations  Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, as well as conflicts in other  theaters of war. [["", Page , H9162, ]  The military was there doing a job no other branch of our nation's  government could do--in the face of overwhelming danger--when the fate  of the American Experiment was on the line.  Our thanks to the military for always answering the call of duty-- whether that call comes in the dead of night or the light of day--we  know that we can count on you.  The names and faces of millions of African Americans who have served  our nation in uniform may fade from memory, but today we have the  opportunity to remember and see them in the faces of the young men and  women who preserved freedom in the world, even at a time when the  blessings of liberty were denied to them at home.  The Jackson Lee provision in the FY2021 NDAA recognizes that there is  no shortage of distinguished veterans, and especially African American  and Native American veterans, who are worthy of the honor of naming a  military facility in their honor.  Let me provide for the record some representative candidates.  UNITED STATES ARMY  General Roscoe Robinson Jr., the first black four-star general in the  Army and 1951 West Point graduate who attended the service academy  before the Army was desegregated and served in Korea and Vietnam, with  valor decorations in both conflicts, and as a training officer as part  of the U.S. military support mission in Liberia. He went on to become  the first black commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, deputy chief  of staff for operations in U.S. Army Europe, commander of U.S. Forces  Japan, the U.S. representative on the NATO Military Committee.  William Harvey Carney was the first African American recipient of the  Congressional Medal of Honor, which he received for his actions on July  18, 1863 at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, while a member of the 54th  Massachusetts Regiment in the Civil War--the state's first all-black  regiment.  The 54th Massachusetts was the subject of the film, ``Glory,''  starring Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman.  Lieutenant Colonel Charity Edna Adams was appointed to lead the  African American Women's Army Corps unit designated as the 6888th  Central Postal Directory Battalion, which became known as the ``Six  Triple Eight.''  The ``Six Triple Eight'' unit was instrumental in establishing and  maintaining morale because it assured that mail from the battlefront  and the home-front flowed efficiently and timely.  Lt. Col. Margaret E. Bailey of the Army Nurse Corps was the first  nurse to be promoted to lieutenant colonel.  UNITED STATES NAVY  Messman First Class Dorie Miller was serving in a noncombat role in  the Navy, when he acted heroically to defend lives after his ship, the  USS West Virginia was attacked at Pearl Harbor.  He was the first African American to be awarded the Navy Cross, the  third highest honor awarded by the United States Navy at the time.  Admiral Michelle Howard is a four-star Admiral and one of the  highest-ranking African American women ever to serve in any branch of  the military. Admiral Howard is also the first African American woman  to command a U.S. naval vessel, the USS Rushmore.  She is the Navy's second highest ranking officer and is currently  serving as the commander of U.S. Naval Forces Africa, commander of U.S.  Naval Forces Europe, and commander of Allied Joint Force Command  Naples.  UNITED STATES AIR FORCE  In 2012, Lieutenant Colonel Shawna Rochelle-Kimbrell became the first  female African American fighter pilot in the Air Force history and her  flights in Northern Watch marked her as the first female pilot to fly  combat missions for Misawa's 35th Fighter Wing and the first African  American woman to employ ordinance in combat. She has logged more than  1,110 hours in the F-16, including 176 hours of combat time.  Colonel Ruth A. Lucas was the first African American woman in the Air  Force to be promoted to the rank of colonel. At the time of her  retirement in 1970, she was the highest-ranking African American woman  in the Air Force.  In 1959 General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. became the first African  American Major General in the United States Air Force. As the organizer  and commander of famed 332nd Fighter Group known as the Tuskegee  Airmen, his place in history will be forever remembered and revered.  General Davis received many decorations during his career, including  two Distinguished Service Medals and a Silver Star and on December 9,  1998, General Davis was awarded his fourth general's star by President  Bill Clinton.  UNITED STATES COAST GUARD  Chief Petty Officer Alex Haley is best known for writing letters for  his shipmates and his short stories and articles, which got him  promoted to Chief Journalist of the Coast Guard in 1959.  Haley ultimately received a number of military honors, including the  American Defense Service Medal, World War II Victory Medal and an  honorary degree from the Coast Guard Academy but most of you know him  also as the author of ``Roots,'' the path-breaking and epic retracing  of a family's history from the Gambian coast in Africa to the New World  in America.  In 1957, Captain Bobby Wilks became the first African American Coast  Guard aviator. He later became the first African American to reach the  rank of Captain and the first to command a Coast Guard air station. He  accumulated over 6,000 flight hours in 18 different types of aircrafts.  Madam Speaker, 25 percent of the today's active duty military is  comprised of persons of color, of which 17.8 percent are African  American.  This percentage outpaces the percentage of African Americans in the  general population (13 percent) but lagging significantly is the 9% of  African Americans in the commissioned officer ranks.  NATIVE AMERICANS  The Jackson Lee Amendment offered during House consideration of the  NDAA was expanded to include Native Americans.  It is without doubt that the military has a storied history of Native  American contributions to the securing our nation since colonial times  to the present.  One famous example of their contributions occurred during World War  II when the U.S. military developed a specific policy to recruit and  train Navajo speakers to become ``code talkers.''  Code Talker is the name given to 29 Navajo Natives who used their  tribal language to send secret communications on the battlefield.  The Marines formed the Navajo Code Talkers, who created a code based  on the complex, unwritten Navajo language.  The code primarily used word association by assigning a Navajo word  to key phrases and military tactics.  This system enabled the Code Talkers to translate three lines of  English in 20 seconds, not 30 minutes as was common with existing  codebreaking machines.  The Code Talkers participated in every major Marine operation in the  Pacific theater, giving the Marines a critical advantage throughout the  war.  During the nearly month-long battle for Iwo Jima, for example, six  Navajo Code Talker Marines successfully transmitted more than 800  messages without error.  Marine leadership noted after the battle that the Code Talkers were  critical to the victory at Iwo Jima.  The Navajo Code was never broken.  Our Native American brothers and sisters are more than worthy to be  so honored by having their names considered for military bases and  installations.  BOOGALOO AND PROUD BOYS  Another Jackson Lee Amendment included in the House version of the  NDAA directed the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress the  extent, if any, of the threat to national security posed by domestic  terrorist groups and organizations motivated by a belief system of  white supremacy, such as extremist groups like the Boogaloo Boys and  the Proud Boys, is reflected in the Conference bill.  The concern is that in the aftermath of a historic national election,  the activity of violence influencers like Boogaloo Boys or Proud Boys  will increase and lead to attacks becoming more frequent.  We have witnessed too many instances of violent extremists searching  for opportunities to sow violence and disrupt democratic processes and  Boogaloo and Proud Boys are targeting constitutionally protected  activity to coopt or to provide cover for attacks.  Jackson Lee Amendment 179 implements a recommendation made by the  Cyberspace Solarium Commission to require the Secretary of Homeland  Security to develop a strategy to implement Domain-based Message  Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) standard across  U.S.-based email providers to increase the security of email,  The security of email has grown in importance as it has become in  many ways the primary way that businesses, consumers, government  communicate.  The Senate bill also addressed this important issue and the language  of the final Conference concurs.  For all these reasons, I urge all Members to join me in voting to  override the President's unwise and ill-considered veto of the William  M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2021.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered.  There was no objection.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Will the House, on  reconsideration, pass the bill, the objections [["", Page , H9163, ] of the President to the contrary notwithstanding?  Under the Constitution, the vote must be by the yeas and nays.  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question  will be postponed.    "
506,Lloyd Smucker,0.16898231208324432,R,smucker,smucker," Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I also rise today to honor the brave men  and women in my district and across America who have been working hard  to combat COVID-19.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, doctors, nurses, and medical  professionals in hospitals, long-term care facilities, and community  health centers have committed long hours away from their families to  put the needs of others before their own. They have worked without  pause to keep our community healthy and to care for those in need.  Throughout this pandemic, farmers, producers, truck drivers, and  manufacturers have also worked without pause to provide for us all. The  farmers and agriculture producers in my district adjusted to changes in  supply chain operations to keep our Nation fed. Truck drivers and  logistics professionals ensured deliveries of essential goods and  personal protective equipment were delivered, and delivered on time.  Educators have also faced significant challenges this year, but they  have continued to provide students with the best education possible in  these circumstances. Adapting to the challenges of remote instruction,  educators in school districts had to adjust quickly to make sure  students are still receiving that quality education. America's teachers  always rise to the occasion, and they have done so once again.  Madam Speaker, we also honor the brave servicemembers in the United  States Armed Forces who are away from their families for this upcoming  holiday season, and we pray for their continued safety. We must also  hold their families in our hearts as they, too, serve our Nation with  bravery while their loved ones are abroad.  Madam Speaker, lastly, I thank everyone here in the Capitol working  hard to put safety measures in place so we can be here in Washington to  serve and work for the American people. I know that brighter days lie  ahead for our neighbors and nations. Therapeutics and vaccines are  going to help us turn the corner on this virus.  Please keep your loved ones and neighbors in mind. Wear a mask, wash  your hands, and practice social distancing this holiday season.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
507,Darren Soto,1.462057113647461,D,soto,soto," Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, there is a mix of hope and despair in central  Florida.  This week, the first vaccines arrived to help protect our healthcare  professionals. But unemployment remains around 10 percent; food banks  lay bare; many are behind on rent; and coronavirus cases continue to  rise.  The message is clear in both Florida and across our Nation: Americans  need help.  It is time for this Congress to come together and pass meaningful  coronavirus emergency relief to defeat the virus; to help small  businesses and the unemployed; and to ensure food, housing, and direct  stimulus checks for our constituents.  The solution is within our grasp. We just need to come together this  week to get the job done.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues: Don't be an Ebenezer  Scrooge. Embrace the Christmas spirit. Join me and vote ``yes.''    "
508,Abigail Spanberger,0.9504339098930359,D,spanberger,spanberger," Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of ', H. Res. 908, "". I rise today in support of my constituents of Asian descent.  Central Virginia is the proud home to a strong and vibrant Asian- American community. And since COVID-19 began, we have seen a disturbing  increase in hate crimes directed at the Asian-American community across  the country, including in Virginia.  Our neighbors, our fellow Americans, should never be the victims of  discrimination, violence or derision. And today, I am proud to stand  with them and support this resolution on the floor of the House.  We should all actively and forcefully condemn these acts of hate  directed at our friends and our neighbors, at home, across our  communities. And today, I am proud to do so with my vote on the floor  of the House. A vote that affirms the following:  That we call on public officials to condemn and denounce anti-Asian  sentiment;  That we recognize that the health and safety of all Americans of any  background should be our priority;  That we condemn the manifestation and the expression of racism,  xenophobia, and anti-Asian sentiment;  That we call on Federal law enforcement officials working with State  and local officials to expeditiously investigate hate crimes; and  That we recommit the United States' leadership to build a more  inclusive, tolerant society.  Madam Speaker, to my colleagues who agree with these principles, I  urge them to vote ``yes'' in support of this resolution and in support  of our neighbors. I, for one, will proudly vote ``yes.''    "
509,Ross Spano,0.09343727678060532,R,spano,spano," Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Lamborn, and I appreciate  the opportunity to speak.  Mr. Speaker, when I heard about the opportunity to talk this evening  in [["", Page , H7100, ] celebration of National Bible Week, I was really, really excited. I was  excited because it gives me the chance to talk about something very  special to me.  When I was a boy, I remember seeing my mother read her Bible daily at  our kitchen table. Every now and then, I would look over her shoulder  at her open Bible to see numerous passages underlined or highlighted,  notes and prayers written in the margins. I also I remember my mom  quoting verses from the Bible in response to the circumstances of our  lives.  {time} 1815  As I grew, my mom encouraged me to read the Bible. She assured me it  had the answers to life's questions, how to live, how to treat others,  how to know God's plan for my life. Most importantly, it would show me  how to connect with God, how to have a relationship with him that would  change my life here on this Earth, but also in the life to come.  Like many young people, I wasn't a very good listener, so I didn't  give the Bible much attention in my early years until I hit a  particularly hard stretch and was driven to my knees as a younger man.  It was then that I remembered what my mother had told me, the Bible has  the answers.  I began spending time every day reading the Bible. I learned about  how God created the Heavens and the Earth; how he created man with a  free will and so would never force man to love or serve Him; how He  called the Nation of Israel to be his chosen people; how He sent his  only son, Jesus, to live a perfect life and then to die a cruel death  to pay the price for every man's sin, if they would just accept Him and  the forgiveness that He offers.  These are important things. But the Bible also helps me today. It  helps me know how to love and care for my wife and my children. It  shows me how to love unlovable people, how to let hatred go and to  forgive, and how to have peace in my heart that passes all human  understanding. It gives me hope on tough days, at times when I can't  understand what is happening around me.  And now today, although it is hard to explain and probably as  difficult to understand, after 30 years eating and drinking,  figuratively, from the truth of the Bible, I can't get enough of it. I  can't go even one day without it. My soul becomes hungry and thirsty. I  become weak and discouraged. You see, now I can't live without this  Book. It is absolute life to me.  This is a crazy, messed up world, and it only makes sense to me when  I see it through God's lens when I see how the story ends and how He  redeems this mess and reconciles man to Himself once and for all time.  Yes, all of that is in this very special book called the Bible. And  so, if you are searching for meaning today, if you are searching for  truth, longing and thirsting for the answers to life's most important  questions, I encourage you to do the same thing that I was encouraged  to do. Pick up this book and begin reading it every day. I promise you;  it will change your life. The words and truth contained in it will give  you hope and peace and purpose like you have never before experienced.  I would like to take this last moment to thank you, God, for using  the Bible to show me how to live, and, most importantly, how to live  forever. I love you.    "
510,Jackie Speier,0.985162079334259,D,speier,speier," Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time and for  his outstanding leadership, patience, and perseverance.  I also thank Ranking Member Thornberry for his many years of  distinguished service to our Nation, both in the military and in  Congress.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the committee, Mr. Kelly;  also the committee staff, Craig, David, Hannah; and my personal staff,  Josh, Brian, and Luke.  Before I speak about the conference agreement, I feel like I must  speak about the Fort Hood Independent Review, which was ordered after  Specialist Vanessa Guillen's murder. This is the report. It is being  released in a matter of 3 minutes by the Secretary of the Army. I won't  go into details, but I will say that it is a damning expose of a system  at Fort Hood that does a shameful disservice to the sacrifices of our  servicemembers and their families.  The report makes clear what I have been saying since before I was on  the Armed Services Committee, that the Army sexual assault and  harassment response has failed, that servicemembers are afraid to  report, believe they will not be taken seriously and will be retaliated  against, and that major systemic changes are needed, including greater  independence from the chain of command for handling sexual assault and  harassment.  Any parent reading this report would have to ask themselves: Is my  son or daughter safe in the military?  This bill is not perfect. Important provisions on sexual assault and  domestic violence were left out. But this conference agreement would  make progress, including a new confidential reporting option for sexual  harassment and a provision to ensure that servicemembers who report  sexual assault are not disciplined for related minor infractions.  It also includes a pay raise for servicemembers, long-overdue  provisions to promote racial and gender equity within the armed  services, including goals for accessions and promotions of persons of  color and women, as well as the creation of a new deputy inspector  general for diversity and inclusion that will investigate White  supremacists' activities by servicemembers.  Additionally, the bill expands support for childcare and provides for  exceptional family member services.  Therefore, I will be voting for the bill, and I hope my colleagues  will join me in this. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to recognize  that this is just the beginning. We have more to do. More lives are  lost and must be accounted for.    "
511,Greg Stanton,1.0714024305343628,D,stanton,stanton," Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Clean  Economy Jobs and Innovation Act.  To better position ourselves for the 21st century economy, we need to  invest in energy-efficient infrastructure that is both sustainable and  makes good business sense. This bill does that by incorporating my  legislation to reauthorize the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block  Grant program to provide grants to States, local governments, and our  Native American Tribes to reduce fossil fuel emissions and conserve  energy.  When this program was last funded, local governments were able to  pursue a large range of projects, from energy retrofits to deployment  of LED street lighting and solar energy systems to electric vehicle  charging stations and alternative fuel pumps.  A national evaluation of the program's effectiveness found that with  just 1 year of funding, 25.7 million metric tons of carbon equivalent  was avoided. And $5.2 billion in cumulative energy bill savings were  produced, 70 percent of which were realized by residential customers.  Just imagine what we can achieve with the dedicated, multiyear  funding this bill provides. It will create jobs, help consumers save on  their energy bills, open new opportunities for local governments to  invest in energy conservation, and reduce carbon pollution.  Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Pallone for his leadership on this  legislation.    "
512,Pete Stauber,0.7903514504432678,R,stauber,stauber," Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, Mike's Western Cafe, a family-run diner for  38 years, closed its doors in Duluth, Minnesota, for good on October 7.  On October 25, Waters of Superior, an art gallery and boutique, went  out of business.  On the 27th of last month, Grandma's in the Park Bar and Grill, a  local watering hole in Hibbing, Minnesota, was forced to call it quits.  And after 10 years in business, the Duluth Candy Company is closing  up shop for good on December 31.  These are just a few stories of so many real people, real small  business owners in my district who are losing their livelihoods due to  effects of the COVID-19 closures. Yet here we are today, with mere days  left in the year to get something done for the American people who are  suffering, and Speaker Pelosi has brought up a drug legalization bill  as mom-and-pop shops close for good, as families remain uncertain where  their next paycheck is coming from, as children struggle to receive  their education, and as childcare facilities close. As seniors remain  isolated from their families, this is their solution: a drug  legalization bill.  Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle like to point  out that they have passed the Heroes Act, so they claim they have done  their part. The Heroes Act was filled with so many partisan wish-list  items that it was embarrassing.  In fact, Speaker Pelosi is so obsessed with pushing drug legalization  efforts forward, she even puts provisions in the Heroes Act--if you can  believe this--a new annual study on diversity and inclusion within the  marijuana industry.  Come on, man. Families are losing their livelihood. People are  hurting.  Mr. Speaker, Speaker Pelosi's answers to these families is: ``It is  out of our hands.''  It is not out of our hands. We have the responsibility and  opportunity to provide relief to the American people. We have the power  to do better and work harder and be better than this.  It is time we think about the real needs of our constituents and get  back to work on legislation that matters. Our priority should not be  legalizing drugs or banning tigers; it must be bipartisan, targeted  COVID-19 relief.  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time each side  has remaining.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Texas has 13\\1/2\\  minutes remaining. The gentleman from Ohio has 11 minutes remaining.  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, you know what I am most--how should I  say it?--honestly grateful for in the backdrop of Thanksgiving? That we  had a Speaker of the House who never stopped negotiating and trying to  find relief for the dying Americans and those suffering from COVID-19  with a major infusion of dollars almost 8 months ago. I am grateful for  that.  I am grateful that we are now in the midst, if you will--late, but  engaging--of negotiations, and that we are committed not to leave this  place, not to go home for any holidays before we provide relief for the  American people. I am grateful for that. That is going to happen.  So it is important to note that work is going on, led by our Speaker,  and we hope that we will have the right partner to be able to save the  lives of the American people who are now suffering from COVID-19. The  MORE Act also saves lives.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lee), distinguished member of the Committee on Appropriations and  one of the strongest advocates for the MORE Act to save lives, to help  young people.  {time} 1000    "
513,Elise Stefanik,1.7880722284317017,R,stefanik,stefanik," Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of New York State  Senator Betty Little, an extraordinarily dedicated and effective public  servant for the north country, to congratulate her on her upcoming  retirement.  Betty has dedicated decades of her life to representing the  hardworking families of upstate New York, both during her time in the  New York State Assembly and the State Senate.  Senator Little first began her career in public service at the local  level, and served in many capacities while also working as a teacher  before her election to the New York State Assembly in 1995. She was  later elected to the State Senate in 2002.  Betty has accomplished countless legislative results over the years,  expanding benefits for military families, saving hardworking taxpayer  dollars, protecting jobs in the Adirondacks, and always standing up for  the people of the north country.  While petite in stature, Betty is truly a giant among public  servants.  Senator Little sought election to public office as a working mother,  a time when this was a lot harder and less in vogue. She quietly  shattered innumerable glass ceilings and paved the way for generations  of women to come.  I am proud to call Betty Little a legislative partner, a role model,  and a dear friend.  I offer Betty my most sincere congratulations and gratitude, and I  wish her and her family all the best in this next chapter.  It is my privilege to highlight her accomplishments in the  Congressional Record.    "
514,Bryan Steil,0.2988791763782501,R,steil,steil," Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the 2020 Water  Resources Development Act.  In southeast Wisconsin, the Great Lakes are vital to our environment,  our economy, our health, and our way of life. Let me put it this way:  If the Great Lakes region were a country, it would have the third  largest economy in the world.  We must pass WRDA to protect the Great Lakes, invest in America's  water infrastructure, and generate economic growth.  Earlier this year, I urged the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee to include the Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study and the  Brandon Road project in WRDA. Both programs are included in today's  bill. These programs detect vulnerabilities along the Great Lakes  shoreline and prevent invasive species in the Great Lakes.  Mr. Speaker, I ask Congress to pass WRDA and support the Great Lakes  for generations to come.    "
515,Greg Steube,0.8313430547714233,R,steube,steube," Mr. STEUBE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr Speaker, let's be clear: The real threat to our democracy are the  attempts to undermine the election process.  Universal mail-in voting is not the same as absentee ballots like we  do in Florida. When a voter requests an absentee ballot, she knows to  expect it. Universal mail-in voting is when States mass mail ballots to  voters, whether or not a voter has moved, has died, or is otherwise no  longer eligible to vote or is even a citizen of our country. Universal  mail-in voting increases the risk of election crime or administrative  error because States are providing prepaid return envelopes for  election ballots.  The U.S. Postal Service does not typically postmark premarked mail,  and although it has a policy to postmark election-related mail, its  policy is not foolproof, as we have seen in some primary elections over  the summer.  All of these last-minute changes will harm the integrity of the  election process and risk chaos in the general election. We are already  seeing the disastrous results of the Democrats' last-minute process  changes.  Last week, the Justice Department found that several military ballots  were discarded in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. Seven of the nine  ballots were cast for President Trump--not surprising.  This month, the Georgia Secretary of State revealed that at least  1,000 Georgians voted twice in the June 2020 primary, once via mail-in  balloting and once in person.  In New York, Governor Cuomo's last-minute shift to all-mail voting  cost thousands of ballots in Chairwoman Maloney's primary to be  discarded for lacking postmarks. Election officials took 6 weeks to  certify the results of the primary.  In a New Jersey municipal election, a last-minute shift to all-mail  voting resulted in the Postal Service still delivering ballots to  election officials weeks after the election.  If these problems occurred in local primary elections, the risk to a  national general election is even greater. The President is right to  highlight these problems, and I fail to understand why Democrats won't.  The best and surest guarantee of electoral integrity is for Americans  to vote in person where safe and possible, with absentee ballots  available for those who legitimately cannot make it to the polls or  have voter ID safeguards in places like we have in Florida.  This resolution is nothing but political messaging and creating a  narrative without any facts to base it, just like the Russia collusion  hoax.  There is no question that every single American, including President  Trump, wants a peaceful transfer of power after a free and fair  election, but this rhetoric and fear-mongering by our friends across  the aisle must end. The liberal mainstream media and Democrats should  stop this nonsense and let the American people speak.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
516,Haley Stevens,0.6671755909919739,D,stevens,stevens," Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend and the ray  of light that was Vicki Wagner Mansfield, a resident of Troy, Michigan,  who passed away last month after a 2-year battle with brain cancer.  Vicki, simply put, was a pillar of our community, known and beloved  by many. She was raised in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, and she moved to  Troy with her husband, Bruce, in 1985 to raise their family.  Her memory is carried forward by her beloved Bruce; her two amazing  daughters, Abbey and Rachel; and her delightful grandson, Hank.  Vicki was known as a loving wife, mother, grandmother, daughter,  sister, friend, and aunt. She is celebrated in our community for her  artistic creativity, that forthrightness, her fierce loyalty, and the  contributions that she made as an active volunteer in our community.  Vicki was a mother's mother. She was active in PTA, school events,  and political activities, always with the goal of: How do I make this  world a better place?  So many former students through the Birmingham school system have  stood up to say how much Vicki meant to them, how involved she was as a  parent with the Girl Scouts or in a play that she did. It was always  because she cared about the outcomes of their lives.  Vicki took the time in some of the remaining days that she had to  message me to say--not with a complaint or with a question--how much  she cared about the work that we do in the Congress, to pass along to  those who are in elected office a note of gratitude and thanks to say  keep going, keep giving it all you can.  That is certainly something that Vicki did every day of her life.  Her passing is also a stark reminder of our work ahead to improve the  research and treatment of cancer in this country. Glioblastoma is a  common and aggressive brain cancer with an unfortunately high mortality  rate. A strong Federal investment is essential to improve our  understanding and care of this tragic disease and for the providers  like those at the Henry Ford Medical Center and what they rely on for  good research.  I carry Vicki's light like a torch in the fight for increased funding  for cancer research. As we inch toward this deadline to fund our  government, I continue to urge and work with my colleagues to join me  in supporting robust brain cancer research funding at the NIH and DOD  to continue this lifesaving work. We cannot let those suffering from  brain cancer and their families fail. [["", Page , H7234, ]      "
517,Chris Stewart,0.7620748281478882,R,stewart,stewart," Mr. STEWART. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I rise in support of this bill to rename the new Federal courthouse  in Utah after my good friend, Senator Orrin G. Hatch. He is my friend.  He was, in many ways, my mentor. He has been a friend of my family.  At the risk of repeating some information that has already been said,  I think it is worth just highlighting some of his really incredible and  notable achievements. [["", Page , H6988, ]  In the first place, just serving his Nation for 42 years in the U.S.  Senate; again, the longest-serving Republican Senator in all of U.S.  history. He rose to the position of President pro tempore, serving  under seven Presidents and nine Senate majority leaders.  I love this fact; it is remarkable: He has passed more legislation  than any other Senator who is alive today, more than 750 bills, which I  think reflects on not only his long career, but on his ability to work  with others because he could not have done that by himself. He could  not have done that just with his own party. He had to do that in a  bicameral and a bipartisan fashion, and he certainly did, and he is  known for that.  Again, the numerous leadership positions, chairman of three major  committees, which have already been mentioned here.  I think it is fair, as well, and appropriate that we mention not only  him, but his wife, Elaine. As good as Orrin is, Elaine is every bit as  good and in some cases better. And their 6 children and 23  grandchildren, the result of 60 years of marriage.  Of final note, Senator Hatch was particularly active and impactful in  the judiciary. I think that every sitting U.S. District Court Judge in  Utah, including, by the way, my brother, owes, to some degree, their  position because of the support of Senator Hatch. He had an  unparalleled career. He had an unparalleled impact on the judiciary,  and it is perfectly appropriate that we name the new courthouse in Salt  Lake City after this distinguished gentleman, and I absolutely support  and endorse this effort.    "
518,Steve Stivers,0.31677141785621643,R,stivers,stivers," Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Great  American Outdoors Act.  My district has 120 projects that benefit from the Land and Water  Conservation Fund, from community parks to the Wayne National Forest,  to the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park.  Public lands, forests, and parks give folks the opportunity to  connect with the outdoors and with each other, especially in this time  of the coronavirus.  I also represent a bunch of small businesses, like Rocky Boots in  Nelsonville that employs 2,800 people and depends on a thriving outdoor  recreation economy.  In my district last year, $1.37 billion was spent on outdoor  recreation. And at a time when there is such a backlog in maintenance,  this maintenance support will create 100,000 jobs.  During a time when we have 11.1 percent unemployment, Congress should  be taking every opportunity it can to create jobs.  Mr. Speaker, this bill isn't just about conservation, it is about  jobs and the economy, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''  It is a Senate bill that passed the Senate 73-25. It is not perfect,  but it is a good bill, and it is a bill we should support.    "
519,Tom Suozzi,1.0548388957977295,D,suozzi,suozzi," Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Chairman for his leadership on  the CASH Act and also, as he mentioned, on the Ban Surprise Billing  Act. It is really amazing the relief we are going to be giving to  consumers this year on a bipartisan basis with his leadership. We are  going to be making people's lives a lot better. So I thank him so much  for the work he has done on both the CASH Act and on the work to  address surprise billing.  Madam Speaker, the effects of this pandemic have been cruelly uneven.  Some remain unscathed, working remotely and still healthy, while  millions of others are awash in misery, unable to return to work or pay  their bills, even funeral bills for lost loved ones.  While the stock market has hit a new record today, there are still  bodies stored in refrigerator trucks. While online retail and grocery  stores are booming, airline, Broadway, and mom-and-pop store employees  have been laid off, and life savings invested in small businesses have  been wiped out.  The President's cynical ploy to threaten the COVID relief package to  obscure his dark-of-night pardons has now resulted in a fighter's  chance that we can pass this $2,000 stimulus check legislation if we  can only get Mitch McConnell to finally show some empathy.  Let's pass this bill, and then let's immediately work to send the  billions necessary to save our State and local governments before they  fire police officers, teachers, and frontline workers, which will only  result in more unemployment checks from us and financial ruin for those  families and the communities they serve.  Let's rebuild our infrastructure and put Americans back to work.  Let's build back better. We can do this if we remember why we are here  and we, both Democrats and Republicans, recognize that outside of this  Beltway fantasyland, millions of Americans are desperately pleading for  our help.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a dear  mentor, an honorable public servant, and a stalwart leader in the  Japanese-American community, Rose Ochi.  Rose was one of my mentors when I was in my twenties and thirties.  Her guidance and her wisdom helped me during those formative years. I  know that I was not the only person whose life she touched. She blazed  a trail for many others in our community besides me.  Rose was a justice seeker and served as an Associate Attorney General  of the United States under President Clinton, as the criminal justice  planning director for Mayor Tom Bradley, and as a fighter for redress  for the Japanese-American community who suffered through internment.  Her work contributed to making America a more perfect Union.  Madam Speaker, we will miss Rose's towering presence and grace, but  her legacy will live on.    "
523,Van Taylor,0.3584381341934204,R,taylor,taylor," Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the legislation  that I introduced with my colleague and fellow Texan from the 16th  District, Veronica Escobar, ', H.R. 8354, ', the Servicemembers and Veterans  Initiative Act.  As a veteran who proudly served our country in the U.S. Marine Corps,  I know how important it is to ensure that those who have served in our  armed services are protected from fraud and appropriately represented  by the Department of Justice.  We owe a great deal to the courageous men and women who risked their  lives to keep us free. Just as they have fought to keep us safe, we  must also work here in Congress to protect those servicemembers from  those who wish to do them harm, and that is exactly what this bill aims  to do.  ', H.R. 8354, "" would formally establish the Servicemembers and Veterans  Initiative within the Civil Rights Division at the Department of  Justice and codify its role and responsibilities. This office would be  tasked with protecting the legal interests of the military and veterans  community and advise the Attorney General on how to protect  servicemembers and veterans from the fraud and predatory schemes that  are out there.  Last year, the Federal Trade Commission noticed that U.S.  servicemembers are increasingly becoming targets of fraud. In fact, our  servicemembers and our veterans lose more on a dollar basis than the  civilians who are targeted by similar schemes. This is unacceptable,  and we owe it to those who serve to prevent this targeted crime.  The Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative at the Department of  Justice would also play an important role in coordinating the  prosecution of those who commit fraud specifically targeting our  Nation's servicemembers and their families.  This bill is an important step toward protecting our Nation's heroes  from fraud, and I am proud to stand with my colleague, Congresswoman  Escobar, in support of this bipartisan legislation, and I urge all of  my colleagues to vote in support of this important bill.  {time} 1715    "

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind us  all of the great American Red Cross program, Holidays for Heroes, an  opportunity to thank and support our military, veterans, and their  families throughout this holiday season.  We all look forward to gathering with family and friends and loved  ones this time of year. For our servicemembers, that is a luxury that  all too often is not able to happen.  These men and women spend many months at a time--at times over a year  and, in their service, years--away from their families. That is  difficult no matter what time of year it is, but it is around the  holidays their sacrifice is magnified.  I would like to encourage everyone to reach out to their local Red  Cross chapters to find out how to send a card, how to volunteer or get  involved however they see fit to spread some holiday cheer to our  heroes. Even a small gesture can brighten the holiday season for those  that are deployed; a reminder that they are remembered, that they are  appreciated every day, especially during this holiday season.  So take a moment out of your day today to let a soldier know just how  much you appreciate them.    "

526,Bennie Thompson,3.481454849243164,D,thompson,thompson," Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this  legislation.  To be clear, this package is nowhere near enough. House Democrats  passed three times more relief in May; our Republican colleagues did  nothing. We passed more than double this 2 months ago; our Republican  colleagues did nothing.  This package is not commensurate to the magnitude of the crisis we  face. We need to do more, including vital aid to State and local  governments and help for our restaurant industry, but this is a start.  This legislation includes important funding for vaccine distribution,  schools, small businesses, and a desperately needed extension of  unemployment insurance.  I am pleased that this legislation also extends clean energy tax  credits, provides disaster tax assistance, helps prevent tragic flame  jetting accidents, and provides help for the hardworking men and women  in my district and across this country.  Madam Speaker, this is not enough, but it is a start. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes.''    "

Madam Speaker, I continue to support this bill, as more than 80  percent of the House did just 20 days ago. It is the exact same bill,  not a comma has changed.  It still prevents the military from having their pay cut. It still  creates new tools to deal with a newly aggressive China. It still  includes the important U.S.-Israel Assistance Act and provides help for  Vietnam veterans.  One thing, I guess, is new in the past few days, because a  devastating cyberattack by Russia has been exposed; but, fortunately,  this bill has dozens of provisions to help strengthen the country's  defenses in cyber.  So the President has exercised his constitutional prerogative. Now,  Madam Speaker, it is up to us. Our troops, the country, indeed, the  world is watching to see what we will do, whether we can tune out other  differences and still come together to support the men and women of the  military and American national security.  I would only ask that, as Members vote, they put the best interests  of the country first. There is no other consideration that should  matter.

Today, I recognize a good friend and great American, Tom Casperson,  who passed away this weekend. Tom lived in Representative Bergman's  district in Escanaba, Michigan.  I knew Tom as a State senator when he worked on numerous issues  across State lines with me. The Good Neighbor Authority promoting  better management of our national forests originated at a hearing Tom  and I put together in Breitung Township, Michigan. Tom Casperson may  have had a greater impact on Upper Peninsula issues in the Michigan  Legislature than anyone who served the Upper Peninsula.  While I knew Tom as a State senator, he will be remembered for far  more than that, including as a man of great faith.

Mr. Speaker, for more than 80 years, Hagia Sophia has  served as a museum visited by people from all [["", Page , H3802, ] around the globe. As a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is an  architectural masterpiece, with a complex history as a place of worship  for both Christians and Muslims.

538,Rashida Tlaib,1.4105134010314941,D,tlaib,tlaib," Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in calling  for immediate action on COVID relief.  It is an outrage that Senate Republicans and the impeached  President's administration are more focused on undermining our election  integrity and faith in our democracy rather than delivering relief to  millions of Americans who are struggling right now.  With over 20 million unemployed and more than 8 million having fallen  into poverty, recurring monthly payments are desperately needed to  protect the American people from further harm and loss.  Due to the lack of Federal commitment and funding, the maximum amount  a worker in my district gets on unemployment is $362 a week, Mr.  Speaker; $962 under the first stimulus payment. So now you are asking  workers, our families, our neighbors, to live with $362 a week. Not  anyone here could survive on that.  Due to the uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus, new stay-at-home  orders and business restrictions are necessary to protect our public  health.  But we must couple this with orders with strong, recurring Federal  support, putting money directly into the pockets of Americans, so they  can actually afford to stay home, and support our local governments and  businesses on the brink of collapse without more stimulus.  This pandemic has also made clear the need of guaranteeing access to  clean water to our neighbors.  Washing one's hands is crucial to preventing illness and spread. We  need to treat water as a human right, and ban water shutoffs  nationwide, and ensure that every American has what they need to  protect themselves during this pandemic.  So, Mr. Speaker, sending stimulus checks, supporting State and local  governments, small businesses, and preventing water shutoffs are some  of the first steps we must take to not only control the spread of this  coronavirus but to recover from its devastation.  I urge my Republican colleagues to please join me in taking urgent  action.    "
539,Paul Tonko,2.492619037628174,D,tonko,tonko," Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, millions of America's restaurants are on the  edge of financial collapse. If we do not get them a lifeline now, we  will lose these pillars of community and economic vitality that have  long stood throughout our Nation. And we will pay an even steeper price  as millions more Americans lose their jobs and families are left  stranded with nowhere to turn.  More than 110,000 of America's restaurants have already closed during  this very difficult pandemic. Restaurateurs have adapted, have  reinvented, have dug deep to hold on this long. But more than one-third  say they won't survive the next 6 months without Federal help. In my  home State of New York, that figure is closer to more than one-half.  We can and we must act to save these cherished Main Street  establishments before it is too late. The House already passed a  bipartisan bill that gets the job done. With more than 200 bipartisan  cosponsors, "", H.R. 7197, "", the RESTAURANTS Act, would create a $120 billion  revitalization fund that would rescue America's independent  restaurants.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join us in this  bipartisan effort and pass the RESTAURANTS Act. Our Main Street  businesses have always delivered for us. Let us make sure that we  deliver for them now, when they need it so desperately.    "
540,Xochitl Torres Small,1.7758245468139648,D,torres,torres," Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today in support  of the legislation before us, the ``Indian Community Economic  Enhancement Act,''--the Senate companion to my bill in the House.  For too long, lack of access to credit and community development have  hampered the entrepreneurial spirit of Native American tribes. Yet,  across the country, Native American entrepreneurs are ready to start  new businesses, create jobs, and lift up their communities.  My bill is a first step to change that. It updates and provides new  resources to the Department of Commerce's Office of Native American  Business Development. It ensures the Department of Health and Human  Services is using Native American labor and industry products when  appropriate. And, it authorizes the Administration for Native Americans  to provide key financial assistance to Native American community  development financial institutions.  I want to thank my friend Congresswoman Haaland for co-leading this  bill with me, and Senator Hoeven, Chairman of the Senate Committee on  Indian Affairs, for introducing and shepherding this bill in the  Senate.  The American people and Native communities, should be reassured that  there is bipartisan commitment to improving lives in Indian Country.  I urge my colleagues, to vote yes and join us in empowering the  Native American entrepreneurs and communities who are building  solutions for a better tomorrow.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Case) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, "", S. 212, ', as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "

However, for far too long, apprenticeship opportunities  have been utilized almost exclusively for just a handful of  construction-oriented occupations. It is time to open this successful  model to a wider range of careers and invite folks from a more diverse  array of backgrounds to participate. This bill accomplishes both.  I am particularly pleased it includes legislation that Representative  Morelle and I filed to assist small businesses in participating in  registered apprenticeship programs and provide a particular focus on  opportunities for people of color, women, and veterans.  At a time when college students are drowning in debt, we need to  advance measures that offer more affordable pathways to the middle  class. The bill before us will help countless people achieve the  American Dream.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair and Representative Davis for their  excellent work, and I urge the bill's passage.    "
543,David Trone,1.087242603302002,D,trone,trone," Mr. TRONE. Mr. Levin, I, too, rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Maryland Senator Paul Sarbanes.  The magnitude of his loss can be felt throughout Maryland and the  country.  Senator Sarbanes spent his entire career fighting for the issues that  Marylanders care the most about. He was a champion for justice,  authoring the first article of impeachment against a corrupt President.  He was a champion for fairness, tackling corporate regulatory reform  and ensuring transparency for investors. He was a champion for the  environment, spearheading efforts to protect Maryland's beloved  Chesapeake Bay for generations to come.  It is not just his long list of accomplishments that Senator Sarbanes  will be remembered for, it is also his dedication to the people.  Senator Sarbanes defined what it means to be a public servant. He  showed up in the communities that felt left behind. He listened to the  concerns of his constituents, and he worked hard to get things done for  our State and the country.  That type of leadership is hard to find here in Washington. We can  all learn a lot from him. I know I have. My wife, June, and I extend  our condolences to the friends and family of Senator Sarbanes,  especially to his son, our friend, Congressman John Sarbanes.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
544,Michael Turner,0.2106490284204483,R,turner,turner," Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I want to continue our chairman's lauding of  the career of Mac Thornberry, again, over his objections. In my 18  years that I have served in Congress, I can tell you, not only has his  leadership been essential on the Armed Services Committee, but his  time, both as chairman and ranking member, has been incredibly  important. He has served the Nation well.  I want to thank Chairman Smith for his leadership. We have truly a  bipartisan bill in front of us, and it is a result of Mac Thornberry  and Adam Smith, their work to try to ensure that we do put America  first.  Contrary to the prior speaker--before we began to debate this bill,  we heard accusations that this did not put America first. This puts  America first. What is essential about this is that our adversaries are  gaining on our capabilities. They are investing in modernization. They  are investing in capabilities that will threaten our ability to ensure  our safety and our liberty. This bill is about America first.  I would like to highlight a few key issues in this bill.  First, the conference report fully authorizes the administration's  budget request for the National Nuclear Security Administration. These  funds are critical to ensuring our nuclear weapons enterprise remains  safe, secure, and effective going into the future. We have put off  needed investment too long. There is no longer any margin of error or  delay. Now, the NNSA must transform from a culture of sustainment and  maintenance to a culture of development and manufacturing to meet the  nuclear safety environment of the future.  Second, I am pleased that the conference report removes a provision  that would have prohibited the NNSA from conducting necessary testing  and experimentation.  Next, the conference report funds the ground based strategic  deterrent, the replacement for the Minuteman III, which has provided  the Nation with a nuclear security umbrella for half a century.  Transition to the ground-based strategic deterrent will be one of the  most complex projects the Federal Government has ever undertaken.  The bill also continues the progress of Space Force, and the bill  makes serious investments in missile defense by funding the Missile  Defense Agency's highest unfunded priorities. It authorizes funds for  nine SM-3 Block IIA missiles and a new THAAD battery.  The conference report also includes a provision directing the DOD to  collaborate with research centers so that we can bring forward  information on our adversaries and what they are doing.  Mr. Speaker, I encourage everyone to vote for this bill. It is  important for the future and the security of America.    "
545,Lauren Underwood,2.442605495452881,D,underwood,underwood," Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, it has been 6 months since the President  signed coronavirus relief legislation. Since then, the House has passed  two comprehensive bills to deliver urgently needed relief. Senate  Republicans and the Trump administration need to do the same.  Northern Illinoisans are doing everything they can to be safe and  provide for their families, but this is a once-in-a-century pandemic  and no community can weather this alone. We must come together.  America is nearing a million new cases a week. Families are  struggling and facing an uncertain future. Small businesses are closing  their doors. Children are going hungry.  If we, as a Congress do not act now, folks at home will be forced to  face their toughest winter yet, without the support they need as human  beings and deserve as Americans.  Our communities are working together to help mitigate the spread of  this virus. Now Congress must work together to pass a robust, evidence- based relief package. The American people are doing everything they  can. Congress must do so, too.    "

547,Juan Vargas,0.9062404036521912,D,vargas,vargas," Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of International  Women's Day.  Throughout our past, many men have been recognized for their impact  on our society; however, it is extremely important that we recognize  the many women who fueled social change.  Helen Fabela Chavez was one of these women.  Helen was born on January 21, 1928, in Brawley, California, a city in  my district. Like many Chicano children in the early 20th century,  Helen began working in the agricultural industry at the age of 7.  After marrying Cesar Chavez in 1948, Helen left the workforce to take  care of her husband and their eight children.  However, after 10 years, Helen returned to the workforce as the  breadwinner for the family while Cesar Chavez began to establish the  National Farm Workers Association.  Helen and other Chicana members contributed greatly to the success of  the union, and she later became the treasurer for what became the  United Farm Workers.  I want to honor Helen Fabela Chavez, a woman who both raised and  financially supported her family while also changing history from the  grassroots up.    "
548,Marc Veasey,0.6577884554862976,D,veasey,veasey," Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to pass  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act.  Because we are in the middle of a global pandemic that has killed  almost 130,000 Americans and is ravaging my home State of Texas and has  left our hospitals overwhelmed right now, it is now more important that  we do everything that we can to strengthen the ACA. This important  legislation has already given access to millions of people that now  have lifesaving healthcare, many who could not previously access it.  Madam Speaker, this legislation that I am working on now pushes  critical provisions, like lowering healthcare costs, strengthening  protections for people with preexisting conditions, negotiating for  lower prescription drug prices, and expanding healthcare by pressing  for Medicaid expansion.  Madam Speaker, let me tell you something: You don't want to get sick  in Texas right now. You don't want to get sick in Texas right now. Our  hospitals are overwhelmed because of the inaction of our Governor. It  is shameful.  Anything that we can do here to help the crisis that we have back in  our State, which is also about to grip other States in this Nation, we  need to act on it now.  Time cannot wait.    "
549,Filemon Vela,0.36086052656173706,D,vela,vela," Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Emily J. Alpert for her  22 years of extraordinary work and dedication to the Brownsville  Community Health Center Corporation as the director of operations.  Emily has been instrumental in transforming the Brownsville Community  Health Center into the beacon of excellent healthcare services it is  today. Her work embodies the philosophy of providing quality care that  preserves the dignity of all human beings, a philosophy engrained in  the Rio Grande Valley.  For these reasons, I would like to ask my colleagues to join the  Brownsville Community Health Center and me in congratulating Emily on  her retirement and wishing her well in all of her future endeavors.    "
550,Nydia Velazquez,3.015110969543457,D,velazquez,velazquez," Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this relief  bill because the American people cannot wait another day.  Over 315,000 Americans are dead. Three out of every 4 small  businesses have seen their revenues fall, and thousands have shut their  doors for good.  Food insecurity has doubled for families with children, and millions  of Americans are turning to food banks for the first time.  In most states, 1 in 5 households are behind on rent. More than 10  million people are unemployed.  But it's been over six months since the House passed the Heroes Act,  comprehensive legislation to address these issues months ago.  And all this time, Republicans have refused to lift a finger to  provide relief to struggling families. It is shameful that it took this  long for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to come to the  table.  And let me be clear--$600 in direct payments and an additional $300  per week in unemployment is not enough--in fact, it's just half of the  aid that we passed in the CARES Act.  So, while I am disappointed in my Republican colleagues and recognize  this bill is not ideal or as comprehensive as the Heroes Act-it will  provide some much-needed relief to the American people until we can  pass a more robust stimulus under the Biden Administration.  I'd particularly like to thank all the staff from member offices, to  committee offices, to leadership and floor staff, who worked long hours  and through the weekend to help put this package together.  For small businesses, this bill takes action to authorize a second  round of PPP loans to the hardest hit businesses. Importantly, it will  set aside funding reserved for small businesses with 10 or fewer  employees and those in underserved communities. It also utilizes small  banks and mission-based community lenders to guarantee fair access to  small employers.  And finally, this bill provides for what we have been hearing on the  ground from small [["", Page , H7312, ] businesses--the need for cash infusions through grants. By establishing  new guardrails and allocating $20 billion to the EIDL grant program, we  are targeting the hardest hit small businesses to receive these grants.  Meanwhile, as shuttered entertainment venues, including our cultural  institutions and movie theaters, that depend on large crowds to survive  have been closed by the pandemic and faced difficulties accessing PPP  and other SBA programs, this bill creates a new $15 billion dollar  grant program to target these establishments that have experienced a  dramatic decline in revenue.  But our efforts do not end here. We will continue to seek more  assistance next year because Main Street, especially our independent  restaurants, and working families deserve for us to come back to the  table to provide a lifeline while we await vaccine distributions.  So today, I'm voting yes but I urge my fellow members, let's not stop  here. Let's come back in January and pass more relief for the American  people.    "
551,Peter Visclosky,0.5253108143806458,D,visclosky,visclosky," Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding and  her kind remarks.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues support "", H.R. 133, "".  The Defense portion of this bill continues to focus on the well-being  and morale of those in uniform. For example, the bill provides an  additional $116 million for upgrades to childcare facilities and  directs the military services to present innovative ideas to address  the serious backlog for childcare.  However, I must also share my concerns over DOD and its lack of  compliance with many congressionally directed reporting requirements.  For example, last year, the committee directed the Department to submit  a report on its contracts for advertising services with socially and  economically disadvantaged small businesses. The report was 5 months  late.  The Department has also habitually redirected funding in  contravention of congressional intent. One DOD official referred to  these transfers of billions of dollars as anomalies. I refer to them as  habitual abuses. I hope in the future it will recognize Congress'  constitutional prerogatives.  Mr. Speaker, finally, since it was mentioned, this will be my last  floor statement after nearly 44 years of working in the House. I want  to thank all of the wonderful staff who have made what successes we  have enjoyed possible.  I also want to thank my parents, John and Helen Visclosky, and my  sister, Annamarie Visclosky, who believed in me when I was an  unemployed, young former staffer and made my incredible life journey  possible.    "
552,Ann Wagner,0.928634762763977,R,wagner,wagner," Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the tremendous  service of a leader in Missouri agriculture, Mr. Blake Hurst.  Starting out as a young farmer in northwest Missouri, Blake rose  through the ranks of the Missouri Farm Bureau to become a statewide  board member, vice president, and, finally, president in 2010. Over his  tenure, Blake brought the organization to new heights and developed a  national reputation for his expertise in agriculture policy.  After decades of service, Blake plans to retire this year and spend  more time on his farm with his loving wife, Julie, and their beautiful  family.  Madam Speaker, I thank Blake for his unwavering support for Missouri  farmers and wish him the very best as he begins this new chapter in his  life.    "
553,Tim Walberg,0.7665769457817078,R,walberg,walberg," Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for  taking advantage of National Bible Week to give us a chance to talk  about foundational principles.  It was back in 1973--and this is a great book, the Bible. In 1973, a  beloved mentor of mine brought me into his office, and he said: Tim, I  think there is a verse in Scripture that would be good for your life  verse of challenge.  He read to me from Acts 20:24 where it says:  But I do not consider my life of any account as dear unto   myself, that I might finish the course and the ministry set   before me to testify solemnly of the Gospel of the grace of   God.  I took that as a life challenge verse, and it has directed my entire  life since 1973. It has been an impactful verse from Scripture, God's  Word, to direct my steps, imperfect as they may be, to be about  something more than just myself and declare a message that talks of  eternal things and not just for the here and now.  It all began, though, back in my home with my twin brother. My mom  and dad, I thank God they were believers in this book and believers in  God and taught their two young sons to memorize Scripture to impart in  their lives.  It was a verse that was referred to earlier that was the first verse  that my twin brother and I were asked to memorize. It didn't mean  anything really to me until it became personal by putting my own name  in the words of that verse of John 3:16. For God so loved Tim that He  gave His only begotten Son, that if Tim believed in Him, Tim would not  perish, but he would have eternal life.  That made all the difference in the world. It changed my life. It  changed my perspective. It didn't make me perfect.  Mom also asked me to memorize Second Timothy 3:16, where it says:  All Scripture is inspired by God, and it is profitable for   doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for training in   righteousness.  I think mom wanted those words to be not so important for doctrine,  but to correct me, to train me, and to reprove me as I moved forward in  my life.  Even as King David said in Psalm 119: ``Your Word,'' the Bible,  ``Your Word have I treasured in my heart that I might not sin against  You.'' And if I do, First John 1:9 says:  If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive   us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  How our country needs that today. As has been pointed out, we were  founded on Biblical things, principles of Scripture that were seen to  be important for a new nation.  First Peter 1:21 says this--and I end with this Scripture:  But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture   is a matter of one's own interpretation.  We hear that in our world today. We hear that in our country: Oh,  whatever. To thy own self be true. You decide. You choose. You make  Scripture important for you in whatever way.  But it goes on to say:  For no prophecy of Scripture was ever made by an act of   human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.  My colleague, the gentleman from Colorado, thank you for giving us an  opportunity to remind ourselves that this book is from God. It is for  our benefit. It will impact this Nation for good, not evil. It will  give us the way to move forward, to bind up the division that has taken  place, to bind up the uncertainty that is there and put us back on a  path that God can bless.    "
554,Greg Walden,0.6953604817390442,R,walden,walden," Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to mark the passing of a  longtime friend and community leader, Ken Hattrup of Sherman County,  and The Dalles, Oregon. [[', Page , H7242, ]  Ken was born in Keuterville, Idaho, on July 28, 1928. He was one of  six children. About 7 years later, his family moved to The Dalles,  Oregon, where he graduated from St. Mary's Academy High School in 1946.  Along the way, he met his future wife, Marie von Borstel. In the  spring of 1951, Ken and Marie were married. Shortly thereafter, Uncle  Sam came calling, and Ken was drafted into the U.S. Army, where he  served during the war in Korea.  After he returned home and earned a degree in economics, they settled  on a wheat ranch in Sherman County. Like most ranchers I know, Ken  loved the land and practiced progressive conservation efforts. He  enjoyed hunting, traveling, and playing cards with friends.  It is reported that he was a popular poker dealer at the veterans'  home in The Dalles, bringing much joy to those who, like him, wore our  Nation's uniform and preserved our freedom and way of life.  I always appreciated Ken's friendship and counsel over the years.  Mylene and I extend our deepest sympathies to his family during this  difficult time of loss.    "
555,Mark Walker,0.5657702088356018,R,walker,walker," Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding.  Today, as we wrap up three terms, we could not be more overwhelmed  with the privilege that it has been to serve the people of North  Carolina, specifically, central North Carolina, in the United States  Congress.  I am the oldest of three boys, Mr. Speaker, of a Baptist preacher  from the Panhandle of Florida and have had the privilege to live in  North Carolina since 1991. Coming out of college, and having the  opportunity to work, spending 16 years as a pastor, and then the last 6  years of serving in a different capacity.  What an honor to be able to walk the halls and to be able to think  about the history that has made this country what it is today.  We were blessed to hit the ground running, becoming the first Member  since its inception in 1973 to be elected chairman at the end of their  first term of the largest caucus, the conservative caucus of the  Republican Study Committee.  Recently, I have enjoyed extending and wrapping up a term as the vice  chair of the GOP Conference. What a privilege it has been to serve the  bulk of that time as cochairman with Senator James Lankford of the  Prayer Caucus. It has been a wonderful time to gather each Monday  evening--in fact, many people don't even know the Prayer Caucus  exists--for us to gather on that Monday evening after we fly in and for  many years to gather in room 219, right off to my right, and seek God's  guidance as we prayed for constituents and we prayed for the Lord to  give us the hope and direction for this country.  I have lots of reflections over these last 6 years. I think of having  a chance to be the starting pitcher for the Republican baseball team,  an exhibition game for charity. Every year has been quite a treat.  I am sure many of my Republican friends are glad to see that the  Honorable Cedric Richmond is now senior adviser to another gentleman  and no longer in the House.  But what a privilege it has been to see the efforts that goes to the  Boys and Girls Club, Mr. Speaker. And it has been neat that this has  been a tradition since 1909.  And there have been other times. There was the moment when I saw  Steve Scalise, our whip, come back from our teammates being shot at  that morning, and how he came back and has come back strong; and how he  has always represented his faith in a way that I think has impacted  potentially far beyond any political work that he may do in this House.  There have also been times to engage in a more stern manner, serving  on the House Oversight Committee with Chairman Jason Chaffetz. Chairman  Chaffetz did a wonderful job as the House Oversight Chairman as we went  after and questioned some of the unscrupulous behavior of James Comey  and Pharma Bro. In fact, I still think Peter Strzok doesn't really care  for me, but that is okay because sometimes the job requires it.  One of the moments that stand out on the House Oversight Committee  was questioning Cecile Richards, Mr. Speaker, when I asked her  specifically: Does it bother you that there are more African-American  babies aborted in New York State than actually born? I will never  forget that she was not even aware of that statistic.  Nor did I shy away from the fights on this floor. Probably the  darkest or the heaviest moment was when we were working and going back  and forth late into the night on the born alive amendment. And I cannot  help remembering just the heaviness and the oppression of that night,  as only three of my colleagues on the Democratic side stood up and said  a baby that survives a botched abortion should have the right to stay  alive.  I struggled with that. I still struggle with it. In fact, I think it  is apparently evil not to be able to stand up and fight for all of us  who are created in the image of God.  We have heard other comments. The dogma lives loudly. Even a good  friend and colleague from Illinois that was pro-life, that was someone  who advocated, is no longer part of the body and was basically run out  of town. I struggle with those things.  If our rights come from our Creator and, as our Founding Fathers said  they have in the past, do they not also come from the Creator in the  present and in the future?  Not too far behind us here is the rotunda. There are eight pictures  in the rotunda. The first four are depictions of our settlers, the  people who founded this country who came here. In all four of those  pictures, there is a depiction of Christianity.  The other four are depictions of our Founding Fathers. The last one  is my favorite. It is George Washington. The picture is of George  Washington, December 23, 1783, and in his hand he has his resignation.  For 8 years, he had been the commander in chief of the Revolutionary  Army. Yet, in that letter he writes, though he had, potentially the  ability, the military power behind him to be something of almost a  monarch again, he captured something. He realized that if this country  was going to be great, he had the foresight in that letter to write  that the power had to come from we, the people. What a powerful  expression.  As I think back over the last 6 years, I have traveled different  places, 20-something different countries. No place at all has impacted  me more than standing there on the shores there at Normandy. And as our  guide began to talk that day, I thought about this for the first time.  History shows us that those young men were supposed to have air cover  but, because of the horrific weather, there was none. That day wasn't  won by military might; wasn't won by great generals or colonels and  military genius. Our freedom today, we can trace back to that moment,  was won by 18- and 19-year-old young men who kept running up that hill,  one wave after the other. What a powerful place and what a privilege it  is to see these real heroes.  Arthur Ashe put it this way when he talked about heroism. He said:  True heroism is remarkably sober, very undramatic. It is not the urge  to surpass all others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve all  others at whatever cost.  In our 6 years, we have tried not to stick with the talking points.  Maybe we have had a little bit of a different approach serving in  Congress. I never surrendered my voting card either to the  establishment, to leadership, or any special interest group.  Mr. Speaker, I believe the best kind of representative that you could  have is someone who is pledging to represent all communities. You see,  America is the greatest country and the longest-lasting republic in the  history of the world; but the truth is, we didn't get it all right to  start with.  We first launched this idea of individual liberty and opportunity,  but it took a few people and a few years to get it right: The likes of  Frederick Douglass, George White, Shirley Chisholm, Jackie Robinson,  Mahalia Jackson, my friend, Clarence Henderson, and so many more  heroes. But here's the cool part of the story: We never quit trying  until our actions matched our words that in America all men would be  created equal.  One of the privileges that I have had is to serve with John Lewis and  cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge and to spend some time hearing his story  and hearing his history, because I believe this, whether Republicans or  Democrats, relationship is the conduit for good policy. People before  the politics.  You don't have to throw out what you believe or your values or your  principles. But are you genuine? Do we show up? Do we always have to be  the keynote speaker at times?  I was committed to doing this, to be both a conservative and a bridge  builder, and our team committed to that. Hardly a week went by that we  didn't answer the question, are we making an argument, or are we making  a difference?  In this town, those who make the most noise sometimes get the key  roles. But in looking back, making the difference is ultimately the  prize.  The successes? I believe it is simple; staying close to the Lord and  having [["", Page , H6852, ] the people pray and wrap their arms around us.  So many times, after spending a week in this arena, this gladiator  arena, you go back home depleted and kind of worn out. And I will never  be able to express my gratitude to the people who lifted their arms up  and prayed for us week after week.  A couple of months ago, I met Freddy in New Bern, North Carolina.  Freddy's a little street vendor with his guitar, and he had his guitar  case open and was hoping to make a few bucks. I had a chance to  harmonize with him as he played Let My Little Light Shine.  What a reminder this season that, ultimately, what our calling is, it  is to let our light shine.  I think of Luke 2; I think of all the different things in this season  that mean so much.  In this city, there are some ups and downs, there are some double- crosses, but I can tell you, I leave today with no bitterness, no axe  to grind, not jaded, with a genuine love for my colleagues.  I specifically have to point out three that I have had the privilege  of getting to know and having dinner with, basically, for about 3\\1/2\\  years, almost once a week, Tuesday evenings with Trey Gowdy, Senator  Tim Scott, and the Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe. I  love these men. They have impacted my life. There were times the  fellowship and the joy and the laughter, and even the merciless  cutdowns from Mr. Gowdy, were incredibly rewarding and timely.  But there are people behind the scenes here in Washington, D.C.,  names that you will never know, but people like Everette, Carmelita,  Lloyd, the people behind the scenes that continue to impact.  In closing today, I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the  people that made this possible, both in North Carolina and here in  Washington, D.C. My appreciation to Janine, Grace, Joel, Bradley, Kyle,  Phillip, Emily, Dwayne, Olga, Jerome, Amber, Cory, Ryan, Kevin,  Madeline, Dan, Alexa, Carson, Sruthi, Sean, Janae, Alison, Rudy, Kate,  Katie, Louis, Davis, Rusty, Zach, Scott, Arian, Josh, Carter, Keifer,  Dwayne, Luke, Graham, Lauren, Brian, and two chiefs, Scott and Jack,  and a deputy chief, Julie, who has been with me since the  very beginning. I am proud of you guys. We made a difference.  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to conclude by thanking my family,  Ryan, Rachel, Anna Claire, and Kelly. Thank you for allowing me to do  something that is considered pretty special by many.  To my mom and dad, thank you for investing in me and putting in the  values.  So, Mr. Speaker, I would like to close right now by expressing it may  be in the words of Andrae Crouch:  ``How can I say thanks for the things You have done for me? Things so  undeserved, yet You gave to prove Your love for me; the voices of a  million angels could not express my gratitude. All that I am and ever  hope to be, I owe it all to Thee. To God be the glory.''    "
556,Jackie Walorski,0.13916189968585968,R,walorski,walorski," Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans reach Medicare age, we need  to simplify the part B enrollment process and improve education and  outreach to seniors. The commonsense reforms in this bipartisan BENES  Act will protect seniors from unnecessary late enrollment penalties,  gaps in coverage, and unexpected healthcare bills.  I urge my colleagues to support this vital piece of legislation that  will simplify complicated Medicare enrollment rules.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, ', H.R. 2477, ', as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
557,Michael Waltz,0.20070889592170715,R,waltz,waltz," Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize someone very  special on my team, a real-life superwoman, a [[', Page , H7115, ] warrior, a hard worker, an Air Force lieutenant colonel, and--perhaps  her most important job--a mother of five. Her name is Amanda Naylor,  and she has been part of my office for her yearlong Defense fellowship.  Amanda took the hustle and bustle of Capitol Hill in stride. She made  it look easy. She hit the ground running, and whether it was committee  hearings, briefings with Defense Department officials, or working with  other offices, Amanda was always there to provide our team expertise  and drive issues forward.  She used her own experience in the military and the Air Force to  craft legislation like the Rent the Camo Act that provided affordable  maternity uniforms for our servicewomen. It is truly a testament to her  insight and her hard work that she got this bill into the NDAA, into  the defense bill. She is a perfect example of why we need more veterans  in Congress and more veterans in government at every level. They bring  that on-the-ground expertise into our legislation.  Amanda is talented, smart, and, above all, kind. Congress could  certainly use more like her. I am sad she will be leaving us, but she  has made our office and she will make the country a better and safer  place.    "
558,Maxine Waters,2.8365111351013184,D,waters,waters," Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  The relief in this bill is desperately needed, as families struggle  during the pandemic crisis. The negotiations were difficult. They were  tough. I wish we could have done even more, but I am pleased we have  done as well as we could have done to provide relief for so many in  desperate need for their government to come to their aid.  As chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee, I am proud to have  secured $25 billion in emergency rental assistance. We need much more.  We also got an extension of the eviction moratorium and $12 billion in  low-cost, long-term capital and grants to the minority depository  institutions and the credit unions and the community development  financial institutions.  I thank Ranking Member McHenry, Chairman Crapo, and Ranking Member  Brown for working with me on these provisions.  I am so pleased that the legislation includes stimulus payments for  families and individuals. Not enough, but I am pleased.  I am also pleased it includes new funding for unemployment insurance.  Not enough, but I am pleased.  I am also pleased we have support for Los Angeles International  Airport in my district and small business forgivable PPP loans. This  bill will also expand the amount of PPP loans for which restaurants are  eligible by a considerable amount.  Let me be clear: Much more is needed, but this bill is a most  important first step, and I am very pleased that we are able to come to  the aid of all of our constituents.  I thank Nancy Pelosi for the tremendous job that she did in  negotiating to get us to this point.    "
559,Steve Watkins,0.10934149473905563,R,watkins,watkins," Mr. WATKINS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the life and  work of the late Nancy Epoch.  This poster shows a picture of her on the left. On the right, is  college professor Sally Glassman, probably the best tap dance teacher  in Kansas, but that is another speech entirely.  Mrs. Epoch was beloved by all. She was a music teacher, a choral  director, a Chiefs superfan, and a legitimate Broadway talent who then  returned home.  What she really did was that she enabled young and old kids to find  their voice, be bold, and share it with the world.  So, Mrs. Epoch, from the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives  to you in Heaven, first, I thank you for that first Chiefs Super Bowl  victory. I am pretty sure that that was you. We love you, and we miss  you.    "
560,Randy Weber,0.06958094984292984,R,weber,weber," Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we have taken the Bible and God out  of school. We are so smart. We have replaced Him with armed police  officers, drug-sniffing dogs, and metal detectors.  We have kicked Biblical training and principles out of schools. And  now, we have broken families, absentee fathers, single moms struggling,  and disrespect like we have never seen before.  So much for what Jesus teaches us in the Bible: Love others as you  love yourself. Or do unto others as you would have them do unto you, a/ k/a, the Golden Rule.  Today's moral-less culture's motto seems to be, do unto others and  then split, but not before you get a selfie and put it on Facebook.  Disrespect is rampant--witnessing the rioting in the cities recently,  the burning of the American flag. The courts decided in their infinite  wisdom that flag burning is a protected form of speech. All I ask of  those who are going to burn the flag, wrap themselves in it first.  Mr. Speaker, courts have decided that you can't pray in schools, you  can't pray at football games. We wouldn't want to invoke God's  blessings on our gatherings. So much for the commandments in the Bible:  Love, respect, duty, commitment, et cetera.  Our country has gotten away from Biblical principles. Marriages have  been destroyed, drugs are rampant, killing of unborn children. So much  the order of the day, that now the abortion crowd wants to kill people  after they have botched an abortion. [["", Page , H7096, ]  Mr. Speaker, think of it. America's great fighting men and women can  be fighting a vile enemy; we can wing one of their soldiers and we will  do everything we can to nurse that soldier back to health, that enemy.  But we won't try to save a baby we just tried to abort.  God, help us. Lord, help us if we don't get back to Biblical  principles. It is God's guidebook, his plan that this country was  founded on. America, you had better get back to the Bible.    "
561,Daniel Webster,0.03976054489612579,R,webster,webster," Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McClintock for  yielding.  I rise today in opposition to "", H.R. 737, "", the Shark Fin Sales  Elimination Act. As a Floridian and member of the House Natural  Resources Committee, promoting shark conservation has long been a  priority of mine. I am glad to see sharks receiving national attention.  Sharks play a crucial role in our ocean's ecosystem, and yet, they  face a [["", Page , H9082, ] grave threat: shark finning, a cruel practice of capturing sharks,  clipping their fins, and casting the rest of it to a slow death in the  ocean. This practice is cruel and inhumane.  I was a member of the legislature almost 30 years ago when Florida  was one of the first States to ban shark finning. Since then, finning  has become completely illegal in the United States.  Unfortunately, finning still occurs in unregulated waters around our  globe. ', H.R. 737, ' will do nothing to protect sharks from being finned in  those areas. Instead, it would require American fishermen who legally  and responsibly land sharks to destroy or discard their fins, leading  to terrible waste.  Many scientists, conservationists, and commercial fishermen have  vocally opposed this bill and have said it will not advance shark  restoration or stop the practice of finning.  This bill would have a devastating effect on responsible American  fishermen, including many in my own district in Florida who have made  sacrifices to conserve and rebuild our shark populations.  I offer a separate bill, an alternative, ', H.R. 788, ', one that has been  sponsored and supported by Senator Rubio in the Senate and is probably  the key bill there for this particular issue. Instead of banning the  sale of humanely sourced shark fins, my bill would encourage bad actors  in the shark fin market to create science-based management systems for  shark conservation.  {time} 1430  My bill requires any nation seeking to export shark, ray, or skate to  the United States to first be certified by NOAA that it has  conservation policies in place that rise to the standards of U.S.  fishermen and that forbid nations to practice shark finning.  The U.S. plays an important role on the world stage in fishing  management and conservation. ', H.R. 737, "" would remove the U.S. from the  shark fin market; it would silence the leading voice in shark  conservation--my bill would amplify it--and ensure no finned shark fins  enter into the United States.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to make the best choice for  sustaining shark populations long-term and oppose this deeply flawed  bill before us today.    "
562,Peter Welch,1.0665136575698853,D,welch,welch," Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, on March 1, Vermont had the lowest  unemployment rate in its history. Today, it has the highest  unemployment rate in its history. About one-third of Vermonters who  would like a job can't find a job.  The Federal Government is the only entity that has the fiscal  flexibility and the fiscal capacity to meet that need. We have to act.  This legislation would provide Vermont with over $2 billion for State  and local budgets. Absent that, the pain is going to be pressed,  pressed, pressed down into our firefighters, our teachers, and our  kids.  It has reforms to the Paycheck Protection Program so our restaurants  and our small businesses have a chance to make use of that, something  both sides want to happen.  It has $75 billion for testing, which is the path to getting on top  of this virus.  It provides funds to try to stabilize our institutions of higher  education that we must have on the other side of this virus.  There are differences, and we don't have the luxury of time for the  full debate all of us would prefer, but we must act, and we must act  now. If we make a mistake in how we proceed--and mistakes will be  made--it should be on the side of erring to do too much, not too  little.    "
563,Brad Wenstrup,0.42801910638809204,R,wenstrup,wenstrup," Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the impressive  career of my good friend, Dr. Phil Roe, who is retiring at the end of  this Congress.  A veteran himself, Dr. Roe served honorably as chairman and ranking  member on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, where he worked on  preventing veteran suicide, increasing patient access to care, and  providing agency accountability.  Dr. Roe has been a strong leader of our GOP Doctors Caucus, providing  strong insight, a steady hand, and a lot of patience as we have debated  critical legislation affecting patients and providers.  Over the years, I have been blessed enough to call Dr. Roe a dear  friend. He showed me what life in rural Tennessee was like; he has  regaled us with his guitar skills; he has made us laugh; and he has  been a source of wisdom for all of us.  It has also been a pleasure to get to know his beloved wife,  Clarinda, who I know is looking forward to having him around more  often.  I know that I can speak on behalf of all of my colleagues when I say  thank you for your service, Phil. Good luck in retirement, and God  bless you.    "
564,Bruce Westerman,0.18082861602306366,R,westerman,westerman," Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to attend votes today due to  self-quarantining for COVID-19. Had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 242 and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 243.  Personal Explanation    "
565,Jennifer Wexton,2.1147994995117188,D,wexton,wexton," Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, COVID cases in my district are doubling,  tripling, or worse. From the D.C. suburbs to the rural areas, no part  is immune.  What is it going to take to burst the bubble our Senate colleagues  are living in and wake them up to reality? Because in this reality, 12  million Americans are going to lose their unemployment benefits next  month if we don't act. In this reality, tens of thousands of small  businesses are on track to close their doors for good by the end of the  winter.  If our Senate colleagues continue to sit on their hands and continue  to do nothing, then on top of a public health crisis and an economic  crisis, we are also going to have a homelessness crisis as eviction and  foreclosure moratoriums expire.  Mr. Speaker, I am urging leaders of both parties in both Chambers of  Congress to come together, and let's vote [["", Page , H5993, ] on something we can agree on. Let's extend the deadline for CARES Act  funds to be used by States and localities. Let's continue the eviction  moratorium, student loan relief, and unemployment benefits that have  been a lifeline for millions of workers.  Let's do the work our constituents sent us here to do and help the  American families and small businesses who are hurting. We owe it to  the millions of people who need our help.    "
566,Susan Wild,0.4976000487804413,D,wild,wild," Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of a hero in my  community who recently passed away from this devastating virus. Robert  S. Washock, Jr., or Bob as he was known to everyone, was a devoted  father, grandfather, husband, brother, and friend. He defended our  Nation in the United States Navy and was a member of Dyle E. Bray VFW  Post 739 in Bangor, Pennsylvania, serving as quartermaster and  treasurer of the Home Association.  I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to know Bob, and the  qualities that I can speak to are those that touched the lives of  countless people across our community: kindness, humor, and compassion.  The tributes that have poured in from people of every walk of life  reflect the world of difference that he made.  At this extraordinarily difficult time for Bob's family and many  friends, I extend my deepest condolences. On behalf of a grateful  community, it is my honor to pay tribute to Bob for his lifelong  service as an Active Duty servicemember and as a proud veteran to the  country he loved. His spirit will endure.    "
567,Roger Williams,0.3267115652561188,R,williams,williams," Ms. WILLIAMS. I believe that is what President Zelensky was   indicating, that any signal or sign that U.S. support was   wavering would be construed by Russia as potentially an   opportunity for them to strengthen their own hand in Ukraine.  Mr. Manager CROW. This is an important point, particularly when the  President and his attorneys tried to argue: no harm, no foul.  The financial assistance itself was really important to Ukraine, no  question about it. But the aid was equally important as a signal to  Russia of our support for Ukraine. And regardless of whether the aid  was ultimately released, the fact that the hold became public sent a  very clear signal to Russia that our support for Ukraine was wavering,  and Russia was watching very closely for any sign of weakness. The  damage was done.  Now, any possible doubt about whether the aid was linked to the  investigations has been erased by the President's own Chief of Staff.  We have seen this video before during the trial, but there is a really  good reason for this. It is a complete admission on national TV that  the military aid was conditioned on Ukraine helping the President's  political campaign.  Here, once again, is what Mulvaney said.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)    "
568,Roger Williams,0.3267115652561188,R,williams,williams," Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the Central Texas  Food Bank for being a leader in the fight against hunger and for their  commitment to serving our community over the last 40 years.  Their generosity and dedication to our Texas neighbors is at the  heart of the American story. Last year alone, they provided 39 million  meals to central Texas families, including those in Burnet, Coryell,  Bell, Lampasas, Hays, and Travis Counties in the 25th District.  I was grateful for the opportunity this fall to join them  distributing food to veterans and their families in the Austin area,  and I look forward to working together in the years to come.  Mr. Speaker, I thank all the volunteers who are working around the  clock to provide food for families during a time that has presented  unique and unforeseen challenges, especially as we celebrate this  holiday season. By [[', Page , H6818, ] mobilizing our communities to serve and inspiring younger generations  to give back where they can, they are making us a stronger and a better  nation.  May God bless all of them, may God bless Texas, and may He continue  to bless the greatest country on Earth, the United States of America.  In God We Trust.    "

Mr. Speaker, The Washington Times  editorial board is appreciated for publishing ``Joy, and Vaccines to  the World,'' where they praised President Donald Trump for his efforts  to bring a vaccine to the United States faster than any other vaccine  in history.  The article is explaining:  The lifesaving COVID-19 vaccine that President Trump   promised to deliver has arrived in record time. Hallelujah.  On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration concluded its   review of the front-running vaccine developed and gave a   green light for distribution. Initial shipments are expected   to reach all 636 locations across the 50 States by today.  ``Promises made, promises kept,'' Mr. Trump likes to say.   That is the can-do spirit that makes America special. Just in   time for Christmas, the fruits of Operation Warp Speed are   starting to bring joy to the world.  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.  Our family's sympathy for the death of former DNC Chairman Don  Fowler.

574,Steve Womack,0.009940136224031448,R,womack,womack," Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend Rob Woodall for  yielding.  When I was a kid, I couldn't wait for Saturday morning. Saturday  morning in our house, my brothers and sisters, we would get up, and we  couldn't wait to watch our favorite cartoons.  Now, decades later, here I am again, on the floor of the House of  Representatives, watching a cartoon about the only outcome this debate  is going to have today: one of entertainment value, nothing  substantive.  The chairman of the Rules Committee called this a five-alarm fire.  Now that the Democratic Convention has concluded and the Republican  Convention is about to begin, we have a catastrophe.  It is not going to build infrastructure. It is not going to give aid  to people suffering from the pandemic. It is not going to fund the  government by October 1. It is not going to become law.  Just like the previous attempts, my friends on the other side of the  aisle have had to derail a duly-elected President. This, too, will  fail. I urge a ``no'' vote.    "
575,Rob Woodall,0.019880272448062897,R,woodall,woodall," Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the men and women  that I have had the pleasure of working with over these 10 years in  Congress.  When you announce that you are retiring, folks need to start looking  for that next opportunity. So the people who stick it out with you are  a special breed. So, too, are those men and women who come and join  you, knowing that their service will be short.  Mr. Speaker, there are three such people: Sean Lerner, Emily  Macdonald, and Tomas Rodriguez. Knowing I was going to retire, they  came and joined the fight to serve the men and women of the Seventh  District of Georgia and have done an amazing job for me over the past  year.  Catherine Morvis, a name long known in Georgia circles, having served  with Congressman Phil Gingrey, came back to the Hill to help keep  things together for me and move us across the finish line. She is still  serving even today.  Mr. Speaker, I have longtime staffers--Lauren Williams, Nicholas  Scoufaras, Vesna Kurspahic, Naomi Pillsbury--men and women who have  been doing extraordinary work, always under difficult circumstances,  recently under incredibly difficult circumstances.  Mr. Speaker, I have got staffers who have been with me a decade or  more, who have recently departed: Alex Poirot, Kelley Kurtz, Janet  Rossi, and Elena Gabrysh.  Elena and I started working together in 1999, serving the people of  Georgia. Now, more than 20 years later, she has gone into retirement,  having served literally thousands of constituents.  Mr. Speaker, I want to call particular attention to two public  servants that I have been incredibly honored to be able to know in my  life: My State director, Debra Poirot; and my chief of staff, Derick  Corbett.  Mr. Speaker, if you have not had an opportunity to meet Debra Poirot,  she brightens up every room that she walks into with a genuine love for  this country and a love for her community. She lives in Forsyth County,  though she grew up as an Air Force child, calls Texas home from that  time, but has claimed Georgia.  {time} 1300  So committed is she, Mr. Speaker, I remember a World War II veteran,  a widow, and she was losing her housing. Debra woke up on a Saturday  morning and read about it in the newspaper. She spent the next week  finding this family and spent the week after that solving that problem.  She made a difference in that life that can never be measured and did  it not because a constituent called, not because someone knocked on the  door, but simply because she lives a life of looking for opportunities  to make other people's lives better.  She finds herself out in the community each and every day, not just  serving us but fulfilling a true heartfelt mission to see what she can  do that others could not. An amazing woman, an amazing mother, and  certainly an amazing public servant, and I thank her for that.  Derick Corbett, Mr. Speaker, I had the pleasure of hiring him back in  the year 2000. I didn't think he was going to amount to much at that  time, but we needed somebody on the bottom rung of the ladder and he  agreed to raise his hand and do it.  He could not be more of a rock, a rock for our office, a rock for our  community. The common refrain I find when I go out into the district  is: ``Hi, Rob, good to see you. Where is Derick?'' because he has such  an impact on folks.  He won't take ``no'' for an answer when a Federal agency won't serve  a constituent. He demands the service that each and every citizen knows  that they deserve.  He is an even better husband and an even better father than he is a  public servant.  But, Mr. Speaker, there would be no Congressman Rob Woodall if  there were not a Chief of Staff Derick Corbett, if there were not a  District Director Debra Poirot. These two have changed countless lives,  and among them has been mine.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of my staff for the amazing work  they have done over the years. They are great Americans. They love this  country, and I love them.    "
576,Ronald Wright,0.5503163933753967,R,wright,wright," Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment  which would remove harmful language that seeks to upend religious  freedom protections for organizations across America.  Earlier this year, the Department of Labor took an important step in  preserving the Constitution and ensuring the rights of religious  employers. It is simple: Faith-based groups should be on equal footing  as they compete with other employers without having to give up their  sincerely held religious beliefs. Organizations such as the Salvation  Army and Catholic Charities should not be afraid to partner with the  Federal Government to help Americans.  Unfortunately, if House Democrats have their way and roll back these  important religious protections, these organizations will face  uncertainty and confusion in the Federal contracting process, possibly  opting out altogether.  Beyond the fact that it is wrong to tell these organizations that  they cannot work with the Federal Government to provide essential  services, it is flat-out unconstitutional.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand by their commitment to the  Constitution and protect religious liberty [["", Page , H4139, ] for all Americans by supporting my amendment.    "
577,John Yarmuth,1.2235201597213745,D,yarmuth,yarmuth," Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act because it is an abomination that the people  who keep me safe cause others to live in fear.  I rise because I was Breonna Taylor's Congressman, and I will  continue to represent her until she gets justice because Breonna  Taylor, when her door was broken down after midnight, wasn't just  killed by one cop, a bad apple, or even three.  I rise because Breonna Taylor was killed by a system, a system that  allowed police to blindly fire 22 shots, killing an unarmed woman in  her home, and says that is not a crime.  I rise because Breonna Taylor's story, though tragic, is not unique.  Because far too often, that system is more interested in shielding  those who perpetrate these atrocities than seeking justice for those it  is meant to serve. And because, while tragedies like Breonna's are not  uncommon, and millions must live in fear for their lives every single  day--I am not one of them. People who look like me are not among them.  I rise because this system is far too badly broken for Band-Aid  solutions. And this bill, the most dramatic rethinking of policing ever  to come before the United States Congress, is a much-needed and long- overdue step. And every day we delay will cost more lives.  I rise because hundreds of thousands have risen up and made their  voices heard and shown me the way.  And most importantly, I rise because Black lives matter.    "
578,Ted Yoho,0.8202536702156067,R,yoho,yoho," Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, one of the principles this country was founded  upon was the freedom to worship. This is a right that people all around  the world should have, including the people of Iran. Resolutions like  this remind the world that the United States of America will not turn a  blind eye to religious persecution.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch) and the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson) for their leadership in  introducing this bipartisan resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support "", H. Res. 823, "", and I yield  back the balance of my time.    "
579,Don Young,2.028656482696533,R,young,young," Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my chief of staff,  Pamela Day. Next month, after 25 years of service--17 of them in my  office--Pam will begin her well-earned retirement.  Pam first arrived on Capitol Hill as a college student and served in  my office with my friend, the late Representative Ben Gilman of New  York. She first started in my office as a legislative assistant, and  her policy knowledge and genuine desire to serve my constituents  quickly became apparent.  Because of her hard work, determination, and positive attitude, Pam  was promoted to legislative director, deputy chief of staff, and,  eventually, she became my chief of staff. Her leadership in my office  has been invaluable.  It is no secret, as dean of the House, I have been here for a long  time. As a Member of this institution for nearly 20 years, Pam stuck  with me through thick and thin, and I will always be grateful for her  faithful service.  She is well respected by everyone, from alumni of my staff and her  colleagues on Capitol Hill, to leaders in the State of Alaska and  advocates far and wide. You simply do not achieve this level of respect  unless you set the gold standard for what a congressional staffer  should be. Pam has gone above and beyond at every turn.  Mr. Speaker, a chief of staff doesn't just assist the Member; they  have an entire team of employees who, at any given time, are working on  countless issues. My staff would agree, Pam is admired, respected, and  will be deeply missed.  Pam's tenure has seen many of the victories I am proud of. She served  in my office while I served as chairman of the Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure and passed our landmark highway bill,  SAFETEA-LU. She also helped pass reauthorization of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery and Conservation Management Act. And her commitment to  constituents has helped secure millions of dollars for organizations  that serve Alaskans and Americans from all walks of life.  Aside from legislative victories, Pam understood the importance of  the relationships in Congress. She made sure that my office was always  in good spirits. And as many will attest, she ensured that our annual  office Christmas parties were the best on the Hill.  Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of Pam, and I am saddened to see her go.  She served me, our State, and our Nation with professionalism,  commitment, and a sincere love of country. She has always been  committed to the next generation of congressional staff and has been a  respected mentor to many of the staffers, both in my office and around  Capitol Hill. Her leadership in my office was invaluable, and she will  be missed by her colleagues as well as myself.  Mr. Speaker, it has been my great honor to call her my chief of staff  and an even greater honor to call her my friend.  Pam, I wish you the best in your retirement. You have certainly  earned it. God bless you, Pam, and thank you for your service.    "
580,Lee Zeldin,0.8409315943717957,R,zeldin,zeldin," Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure,  which prioritizes six key projects for New York's First Congressional  District, a district almost completely surrounded by water.  On the east end of Long Island, we have a unique responsibility to  safeguard our local waterways, from bolstering our local maritime  infrastructure to managing future storm risks.  Working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and the Army  Corps team at its New York district office, this bill prioritizes local  projects that are vital to my congressional district.  The Fire Island to Montauk Point project includes essential dredging  and shoreline projects over 83 miles of coastline. Coastal storm risk  management for Hashamomuck Cove in Southold is included, where, right  now, local residents, businesses, and first responders are paralyzed  even during a severe thunderstorm.  Additionally, this legislation authorizes a feasibility study for a  project at Wading River Creek in Riverhead and expedites feasibility  studies for projects at Reel Point Preserve and Shelter Island,  Goldsmith Inlet in Southold, and Lake Montauk Harbor in Montauk.  Continuing to safeguard and invest in our maritime infrastructure  will help preserve Long Island's way of life for generations to come.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I thank the chair and ranking member for their leadership in making  this a reality.    "
581,Lamar Alexander,0.3107529878616333,R,alexander,alexander," Mr. ALEXANDER. We have a vacancy at the Food and Drug Administration.  So what if someone said: Wouldn't it be a good idea to go see if we can  recruit the chief medical officer at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in  Houston, one of the most distinguished institutions in the world, an  organization that is even larger than the FDA? Wouldn't it be a good  idea to go get a practicing oncologist? Wouldn't it be a good idea to  get somebody who has worked at the National Institutes of Health and  who has letters of recommendation from more than 80 organizations?  Wouldn't it be a good idea to get someone who has been recommended and  endorsed by the last five FDA Commissioners, under Presidents Trump,  Obama, and Bush?  Well, we have such a person. That person came out of our committee 18  to 5--Dr. Stephen Hahn, the Chief Medical Officer of the MD Anderson  Cancer Center. We should be grateful he is willing to take this job at  this period of time.  I urge a ``yes'' vote, Mr. President.    "

584,Michael Bennet,0.2699640095233917,D,bennet,bennet," Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wanted to spend a few moments to  recognize my colleague and friend, Senator Isakson from Georgia.  When I first came to the Senate in 2009--a decade ago, it surprises  me to say--I was on the Banking Committee. We were in the middle of the  worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and millions of  Americans were losing their homes each month.  We held a hearing on housing, and I remember Senator Isakson coming  to testify because, before he was in politics, he had spent several  years in the private sector working in real estate. I appreciated that  moment because, one, I had also spent some time in business before  politics, and two, because it was so refreshing to hear from someone  who actually knew what they were talking about.  Over the past 10 years, I have had the benefit of Senator Isakson's  experience, friendship, and wisdom on both the HELP and Finance  Committees.  In Johnny, so many of us have had a model for how to get things done  even in this moment of partisan division. He was a welcome throwback to  a time when people didn't come to this town just to spend every moment  on cable news but to get things done for the people they came here to  represent.  Johnny's record suggests there is nothing quaint or naive about that  approach to the work because over his 15 years in the Senate, he has  managed to secure quite a few bipartisan accomplishments, including  several things we have worked on together.  I remember Johnny really digging in and getting his hands dirty on  the SAVE Act, our bill to make Federal mortgage loan agencies consider  the returns from energy efficiency when they determine your ability to  make your monthly payments. We passed that out of the Senate, and it  was a [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7201"">Page S7201</a>, ] tremendous credit to Johnny's determination and focus.  We passed a bill to modernize the FDA's medical device inspections  and to strengthen patient access to rehabilitation hospitals in  Colorado and Georgia. We passed an amendment to strengthen funding for  early learning programs. And we introduced bills together to provide  tax relief for AmeriCorps members who earned Segal Awards to help pay  for college.  I could go on, and it is a credit to Johnny's broad record of  bipartisan work.  Johnny has been a particular champion for our veterans. As a former  member of the Georgia Air National Guard, Johnny has been a steady and  effective advocate for those who have served. Last year, he was  instrumental in passing a bipartisan bill to make it far easier for  veterans to take their benefits to private doctors for care, among  other long-overdue reforms. With our large population of veterans in  Colorado, we were especially grateful to Johnny for his leadership.  There is a lot more I could share, but the point is, Johnny has used  his time here well--with real results for the people of Georgia. He  didn't do it through bullying or shouting or threatening to bring the  Senate to its knees if he didn't get his way. He did it Johnny's way-- with unfailing kindness, grace, humor, and dogged persistence. It would  be easy to mistake Johnny's kindness for a lack of intensity or  determination, but behind his easy smile is a fierce devotion to  Georgia and a welcome impatience with the inaction of this town.  That approach is how Johnny leaves this body not only with a  considerable record of accomplishment but with a long list of admirers  on both sides of the aisle who are now wondering who is going to host  the annual bipartisan BBQ. We are sad to see him go, and we wish him  all the best as he returns to Georgia to focus on his health and spend  time with his wife, Diane, their three kids and eight grandkids.  Johnny, I wish you the very best. Know that the Senate will feel your  absence and cherish the example you set here.    "
585,Marsha Blackburn,0.5193780064582825,R,blackburn,blackburn," Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam President, Alice's statement is loaded with  historical context and correctly implies that what we are seeing now is  the culmination of a slow but sure violation of the laws and norms that  once defined Hong Kong's semiautonomous relationship with mainland  China. These protests erupted after what Beijing argued was a simple  proposed change to existing extradition laws, but the people saw it for  what it was--a thinly veiled threat to Hong Kong's relative autonomy.  It wasn't a takeover. It was just that foot in the door, and China is  nearly unparalleled in its ability to turn a foot in the door into a  permanent existing condition.  Sometimes their power plays are very obvious, and sometimes they are  not. On my recent trip to Djibouti, I saw firsthand the influence of  China's debt-trap diplomacy.  Here is what debt-trap diplomacy is. It is a fancy way of saying that  China has increased its influence around the world by offering to  struggling nations that they are going to hold their debt in exchange  for preferential treatment on trade or maybe a physical presence such  as a port or other sweetheart deals.  In Djibouti City, I saw this tactic run wild. Now China would say  that what they have done is to help the Djiboutians create a ``smart  city'' in the Horn of Africa, but in reality they have negotiated their  way into creating a full-blown surveillance state.  Cameras are everywhere--on every corner and every street, with 24/7  footage--and guess where that footage lands. Beijing. They have even  tried to point one of those cameras at our military base, right at the  entrance to Camp Lemonnier.  Debt-trap diplomacy is bold. It is obvious. If that is all you see of  China, it is easy to assume that all of their tactics are that bold and  obvious. As I said, they will go after you in obvious areas and also in  areas that are not as obvious.  Even domestically, China's surveillance state is notoriously the  opposite of covert. Their domestic ``smart city'' program has outpaced  that of every other country on the face of the Earth and the majority  of their $70-plus billion budget for that project has been spent not on  intelligent power grids or traffic management systems or on clean air  or clean water, but it is being spent on surveilling their own  citizens.  The greatest danger China has created by engaging in brash and at  times absurd surveillance and suppression is that it has created a  false sense of security here in the West when we don't see the evidence  of what they are doing. In the United States we are not particularly  vulnerable to their debt trap, but we are vulnerable to less obvious  attempts to get that foot in the door.  In some form or another, most Americans have allowed Big Tech to take  hold of a portion of their lives. Smartphones and cloud storage once  were very novel, but now we assume that even simple transactions come  predicated by an additional condition. Everything is free as long as  the app or the service has access to--guess what--your data. They want  to own your virtual you.  Popular apps like TikTok, whose parent company is based in China,  have left me with more questions than answers about the platform's  business practices, privacy protections, and ideological loyalty to the  Communist [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7002"">Page S7002</a>, ] Party. Consider that the U.S. Army has barred soldiers from using  TikTok. Everybody needs to understand this. The U.S. Army has said: You  cannot use TikTok. This very body has expressed our concerns on a  bipartisan basis with the platform's censorship and data handling  practices.  It is no wonder that TikTok's chief executive officer canceled this  week's scheduled meetings here in DC with Members of this body. The  fact that millions of Americans, especially our American children,  continue to offer their personal data to TikTok is beyond disturbing,  but we will not be able to roll back the creeping surveillance state  without setting our own standards for what is acceptable from both  foreign and domestic companies.  When I introduced the BROWSER Act earlier this year, I did so not  only to give Big Tech solid guidelines regarding data privacy and  content but to set a new standard for what consumers expect from Big  Tech. Our problem here in this country is pretty much one of awareness  and of understanding that the exact same philosophy drives China's  surveillance programs and their less obvious but much more personal  individual monitoring schemes--their surveillance state scheme.  China's Communist Party is after more than just ad revenue and more  complete data sets. Their goal, as those Hong Kong protesters put it,  is to trick other countries in becoming more like China, which is not  tilting toward freedom but tilting away from freedom.  My goal with the BROWSER Act and with my focus on what has become the  surveillance state is to do the exact opposite--to enable freedom, to  encourage freedom, not only here but around the globe--and to make  certain that consumers here decide how much of their data they want to  be able to share. We must make certain that we continue to support the  cause of freedom wherever human beings show up to protect the freedoms  they have.  I yield the floor.

586,Marsha Blackburn,0.5193780064582825,R,blackburn,blackburn," Ms. BLACKBURN. Madam President, over the past few months, pro- democracy protestors in Hong Kong have captivated the American  consciousness with one of the most stunning mass protests in recent  memory. Hong Kong people are no strangers to suppression. They are used  to the censorship, digital stalking, and persecution embraced by their  overlords in Beijing, and they have seen firsthand the dangers of  tyranny.  Watching these protests play out got me thinking about the core  values that [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S6501"">Page S6501</a>, ] we as the American people share with the Hong Kong people and with so  many others around the globe. There is really an interesting dichotomy  at play: You can turn on the TV right now and see an entire population  fighting desperately on behalf of free speech, self-expression, and the  right to question their leaders' decisions.  Meanwhile, just a few countries away, the loudest voices in the  newsroom are begging for just the opposite. Here in the U.S., Americans  are constantly being asked if freedom is really worth the fight. Is it  worth the never-ending battle to maintain it? The answer is absolutely.  When Americans look at the protests in Hong Kong, they do not see a  foreign policy gray area; they see scores of revolutionaries fighting  an evil regime. They identify with the disrupters, and they cheer for  the underdogs who do not pull their punches, which is why, in 2016,  they sent a disrupter to the White House.  They watch the hysteria that is cable news commentary and get the  sense that the people on the screen have completely missed the point.  The fight is not and never will be about one person or one movement. It  is about the decision to protect liberty or to let liberty die; to  protect justice or to let it die. To dismiss this point is to disparage  the most important feature of the collaborative American psyche. When  asked if freedom is worth fighting for, the answer will always be yes.  The calculus flows into discussions on almost every aspect of  American life. Most recently, at home and in this Chamber, debate has  centered on the ideological makeup of the Federal judiciary. We have  repeatedly asked ourselves: Will the judges we are confirming respect  and protect the core values of the American people? The answer is yes,  they absolutely will.  This is not the first time the American public has swung back around  to consider our ``first principles.'' We talked about them in the early  90s and again--perhaps more passionately--in the early 2000s. Last  week, I was fortunate enough to attend an event at the White House  celebrating our success in confirming well-qualified, constitutionalist  judges to the Federal bench. We have filled 158 vacancies since 2017,  and we are far from done.  I am sure, however, that my friends in the minority wish we would  give it a rest, but we won't. After all, they have had to work overtime  trying to convince the American people that our job is to impose by  judicial decree policies that were rejected at the ballot box. They  want to do this without the benefit of legislative debate or public  comment, which means that confirming constitutionalist judges is far  from being in their best interest.  So here they come, insisting that ``constitutionalist'' is a dog  whistle for racism, sexism, homophobia, and holding regressive and  extreme ideas.  What a ridiculous strategy. The bipartisan nominees this body has  confirmed proved they are capable of resisting the urge to get creative  with the law when it suits the loudest voices in the room. Instead,  they apply the same foresight employed by the Founding Fathers. These  judges know that permitting the government more powers to mold and  manipulate society will give rise to a government that will never  resist the temptation to overstep its bounds.  Our courts are not courts of public opinion, and my friends in the  minority would do well to remember the cost of treating them as such.  Constitutionalism is our legacy and our inheritance. I urge my  colleagues to remember this because we are going to vote to confirm  judges who have proven themselves committed to defending our core  values and the rule of law in the United States of America.  Madam President, I yield the floor.    "
587,Richard Blumenthal,0.8352050185203552,D,blumenthal,blumenthal," Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Dan Freedman on the occasion of his retirement. Throughout his impressive 32 years as a correspondent in the Hearst Washington Bureau, Dan set an example of tireless, honest reporting. He undertook the monumental task of covering the Connecticut and New York delegations with rigor and expertise. Even as the media environment grows more [[<a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7205"">Page S7205</a>]] partisan, Dan has remained fair and dedicated to the facts. Dan has helped build an essential professional foundation for countless reporters, mentoring hundreds of newcomers and interns and holding everyone--including himself--to the highest standards. Regarded with immense respect by his colleagues, he routinely challenged himself in order to set a better example for his team and raise the expectations for outstanding reporting. In DC, legislators trust Dan to deliver a truthful and balanced story. This integrity is essential for the people of Connecticut who rely on reporters like Dan to inform them about the Nation's Capital with a focus on the stories that matter most to them and their communities. Constituents need to know their voices are being heard, and Dan is there to ask the tough questions and to deliver the most complete and honest reporting possible. During an over four-decade career in journalism, Dan did it all-- everything from dodging bullets in wars and insurrections in Central America to covering eight Supreme Court confirmation hearings and even a stint on the George W. Bush Presidential campaign in 2000. His unfailing commitment to his profession was recognized in 2018, when he won the David Lynch Memorial Award for Regional Reporting. Dan's outstanding record of thoughtful, honest, and determined reporting sets a model and demonstrates the critical role of reporters in keeping people throughout the country well informed. I applaud his lifetime of dogged devotion to bringing the truth to light through fair, fact-filled pieces, and I know my colleagues will join me in thanking Dan for his extraordinary contributions to regional reporting.<bullet>   "

589,Cory Booker,0.9934759736061096,D,booker,booker," Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I want to express my disapproval of the  confirmation of Eugene Scalia as Secretary of Labor. America's workers  are the backbone of our economy, and the Secretary of Labor should be  entrusted to strengthen worker protections, support unions, and play a  crucial role in ensuring a just economy. Instead, Eugene Scalia has  repeatedly demonstrated that he prioritizes the well-being of corporate  interests over those of workers. Throughout his career as a corporate  lawyer, he fought against unions, worker safety regulations, and  consumer protections rules. For those reasons, I do not believe Eugene  Scalia is fit to serve as Secretary of Labor.  My grandfather was one of the first Black members of United Auto  Workers at Ford Motor Company, and through him, I learned the  importance of worker rights that collective bargaining provides.  Through collective action, unions are able to provide workers with  livable wages, safe working conditions, and access to benefits like  healthcare coverage and retirement savings. Not only has Eugene Scalia  represented companies in arbitrations against collective bargaining  agreements, but he identifies it as one of his most significant career  moments. The Secretary of Labor should be doing everything in their  power to make it easier--not harder--for working people to join unions.  Eugene Scalia also represented the Chamber of Commerce in working to  overturn the fiduciary rule, a commonsense step towards protecting the  retirement security of countless working families. Employers trying to  design a quality plan for their workers, workers starting to save, and  retirees trying to avoid spending down their nest egg too quickly  deserve access to quality advice, without fear that financial bias is [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S6088"">Page S6088</a>, ] clouding their broker's judgment. Unfortunately, that access to  quality, unbiased advice was ultimately overturned, in part thanks to  the efforts of Eugene Scalia.  More Federal oversight and stricter safeguards are necessary to  prevent the exploitation and discrimination of working people; yet  Eugene Scalia has dedicated his career to fighting against the existing  safeguards. He argued that more than 30 women alleging sexual  harassment and retaliation should have their claims thrown out,  defended a company that refused to hire a woman because she had  dreadlocks, and fought against corporate whistleblowers. He has also  worked to undermine the rights and protections provided by the  Americans with Disabilities Act, stating that workers with disabilities  should not be provided workplace accommodations.  When I go back to my home in Newark, I see many working families  struggling to make ends meet, sometimes while working two to three  jobs. They often face underemployment, wage stagnation, wage theft, and  a variety of other tactics meant to keep wages down and suppress worker  rights. They deserve a Secretary of Labor that will fight for them. The  Trump administration and the previous Secretary of Labor have been  relentless in their efforts to roll back workers' rights, attack  unions, and undermine civil liberties. Unfortunately, I do not have any  reason to believe that Secretary Scalia will be any different. This is  why I must express my deep concern and opposition to his nomination and  confirmation as Secretary of Labor.    "
590,John Boozman,0.25707000494003296,R,boozman,boozman," Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of  Fayetteville, AR, Police Officer Stephen Carr, who made the ultimate  sacrifice in the line of duty on Saturday, December 7.  Officer Carr was sitting in his patrol car in the parking lot behind  the police station when he was shot and killed. The 27-year-old had  been a member of the Fayetteville Police Department for 2\\1/2\\ years  and was assigned as a patrol officer in the Dickson Street  entertainment area.  In that short time with the police department, he demonstrated his  professionalism and duty to upholding the rule of law. The Fayetteville  police chief described Carr as an exemplary officer who was an all- American boy. The chief said at a press conference over the weekend:  ``If I had 131 Stephen Carr's, I wouldn't be more ecstatic.''  Carr grew up in a law enforcement family. He witnessed the  dedication, service, and commitment to protecting the community by  people he loved. His friends described him as a strong and kind person,  whose lifelong dream was to serve as a police officer.  He loved spending time outdoors hunting and fishing. A graduate from  The Woodlands High School in The Woodlands, TX, Carr played football  and earned recognition as an all-district offensive lineman. He went on  to play football at Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, MO, and  his former coach described him as a young man who made a big impact on  campus.  We rely on law enforcement officers to keep us safe. Each day they  put on their uniform, knowing the risks that come with public duty to  serve and to protect. Officer Carr's death is a reminder of the dangers  these first responders face daily and how quickly a situation can go  from ordinary to deadly, which is why those willing to take on this  role deserve both our gratitude and our respect.  The outpouring of support from the Fayetteville community has been a  tremendous strength to the police department as they mourn the loss of  a brother in blue. I pray they we will find comfort from this  encouragement during this very, very difficult time.  My thoughts and prayers go out to Officer Carr's family and friends.  I also stand with all Arkansans in expressing our gratitude for Officer  Carr's service and commitment to honoring the sacrifice that he and  others have made to protect us. We will forever remember him as a true  American hero.  With that, I yield the floor.    "

592,Sherrod Brown,0.9094870090484619,D,brown,brown," Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Robert Greenstein, founder and president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, for his work over nearly four decades, fighting for a more just and equal society. Bob founded CBPP in 1981 to push for policies that expand opportunity for the lowest income children and families, and ensure that this country's prosperity is shared with the workers who create it, not just the wealthiest CEOs and the largest corporations. He built CBPP from the ground up and transformed it from a tiny organization with a shoestring budget to one of the most influential policy shapers in the country. Under Bob's leadership, CBPP combined in-depth analysis and research with clear-headed strategy to drive the debate and deliver results. We worked together to spearhead efforts to permanently expand the earned income tax credit and child tax credit in 2015, and Bob was vital to our success. It is probably the most important thing we have done to life people out of poverty in the last 25 years, and it could not have happened without Bob's leadership on this issue, stretching back decades. Of course it is not only tax credits; from passing the Affordable Care Act to strengthening SNAP, from protecting and expanding Medicaid, to fighting for more affordable housing, Bob's work at CBPP has meant that millions of ordinary Americans have more food on the table, more money in their pockets, and a little more economic security. Over his career he has touched so many lives, and he has so much to be proud of. We know we have a lot more work to do, and while Bob has earned his retirement, I have faith that he will continue to be a force for the progressive change that our country needs.<bullet>   "
593,Sherrod Brown,0.9094870090484619,D,brown,brown," Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the exemplary  service of my now former chief of staff, Maia Hunt Estes.  Maia has been an indispensable adviser and confidante to me for more  than a decade, including my first days in Congress and during my tenure  as Maryland's Lieutenant Governor. It is fair to say that I wouldn't be  here today without her extraordinary counsel.  I could count on Maia day and night to get the job done. Maia brought  an unmatched level of commitment to every issue, every challenge, every  single fight, every constituent case, no matter how big or small.  Throughout our time together, Maia has provided strategic advice and  clear-eyed leadership on national security and defense, transportation  and infrastructure.  Maia served as my key liaison to the Congressional Black Caucus and  Democratic leadership on core issues to me and the people of Maryland.  Her deep understanding of the issues, candid advice, insightful  opinions, and passionate drive for serving others has helped me deliver  for my State, my constituents, our servicemembers, and our country.  Maia served as a mentor for my team, both in my district office and  on Capitol Hill. She led my staff to always put the needs of our  constituents first and work hard to enact real change.  I look forward to seeing the great work that Maia will do as she  takes on new challenges and, no doubt, excels.  Maia, thank you very much for your years of service. You have made a  difference in the lives of many, and I know you will continue to do so  in the years ahead.    "
594,Richard Burr,0.898419976234436,R,burr,burr," Mr. BURR. Madam President, this explanation reflects the status of  negotiations and disposition of issues reached between the House  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Select  Committee on Intelligence for the Damon Paul Nelson and Matthew Young  Pollard Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2018, 2019, and  2020. This bill is named after two dedicated staffers--Matthew Young  Pollard of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and Damon Paul  Nelson of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence--whose  contributions to America will have an enduring, positive impact on our  national security.  The explanation shall have the same effect with respect to the  implementation of this act as if it were a joint explanatory statement  of a conference committee. The explanation comprises three parts: an  overview of the application of the annex to accompany this statement,  unclassified congressional direction, and a section-by-section analysis  of the legislative text.  I ask unanimous consent that the Joint Explanatory Statement for the  Damon Paul Nelson and Matthew Young Pollard Intelligence Authorization  Act for Fiscal Years 2018, 2019, and 2020 be printed into the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows: "
595,Maria Cantwell,1.0885900259017944,D,cantwell,cantwell," Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from  Massachusetts, who has been a leader on this important issue of net  neutrality. I want to speak and back up what he said today about why it  is so important and that we need to fight to protect a free and open  internet, before I do, I would just like to mention that yesterday we  filed a bill dealing with trade enforcement.  The reason I bring that up is because today there is going to be a  lot of discussion about trade writ large. It is very important that in  the trade discussion, we also have trade enforcement. Much of what we  filed yesterday is what we hope to see in an agreement that is now  being unveiled, and this builds on capacity building, which is very  important. We want to make sure we have the enforcement capabilities at  USTR and now the capacity and enforcement in Mexico to make these  agreements work in the future. I look forward to discussing that with  my colleagues.  I am really here to talk about how 2 years ago, the Trump  administration, basically, with the FCC at the helm, repealed net  neutrality and put Big Cable in charge of our internet future. Despite  83 percent of all Americans and a majority of Independents, Democrats,  and Republicans supporting a free and open internet--that means making  sure they weren't charged excessive rates--the FCC chose to side with  cable companies.  Not long after, Verizon throttled the broadband service of Santa  Clara firefighters in California when they were in the midst of  fighting the massive Mendocino Complex Fire in 2018. Despite  firefighters' urgent pleas to stop [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S6917"">Page S6917</a>, ] the throttling, Verizon refused to do so.  For those who don't understand what throttling is, we are always  concerned that without rules of the road, companies would slow down  some access to internet sites. This is so important because we don't  want an internet that is based on how much you pay for faster broadband  access.  We think that to slow down important sites like public service sites  or any sites or to base an internet on how much you pay is the wrong  direction. More importantly, we need to make sure we are policing this.  Even today, as we have no Federal agency with clear authority to adopt  hard and fast rules to keep that situation from happening again, we  need to keep fighting.  Another example is that wireless carriers have been accused of  potentially throttling subscribers to Netflix, YouTube, and Sprint and  allegedly interfering with Skype services. Again, that is another  example of why we have to keep our message about a free and open  internet no matter where we look, where we live, or where we are  accessing the internet.  It is long past time for the Senate to vote on the Save the Internet  Act--something on which our colleague from Massachusetts has been a  leader.  Our bill would restore the protections for a free and open internet  that were had by the Obama FCC in 2015, which would mean no blocking,  throttling, or paid prioritization would be allowed. The FCC would have  the flexible legal standards by which to address concerns that would  arise from these big cable companies' threats to a free and open  internet.  Again, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership-- persistent both in the House and the Senate--in stressing how important  this is.  As my colleagues know, these issues are going to be very important in  the future, not just with regard to privacy, which the Senator has also  been a leader on--and I very much appreciate that the hometown  newspaper wrote a glowing endorsement of the legislation he and I have  just recently introduced on privacy--but in understanding that in the  information age, you have to give consumers rights, that you have to  give them the right to privacy, and that you have to give them the  right to a free and open internet that is not controlled in speed and  that is not controlled by one's saying, If you pay us more, we will  give you access. This is going to be a key communication tool for the  21st century, and it needs to be open.  I thank my colleague for raising this important issue, and I will  continue to work with him and our other colleagues to make it the law  of the land.  I yield the floor.    "
596,Shelley Capito,0.8901270031929016,R,capito,capito," Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise today in remembrance of the life of Brig. Gen. James Kemp McLaughlin, who passed away this week after living an impressive 101 years full of honor, [[<a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7153"">Page S7153</a>]] integrity, and service to his Nation, State, and county. General McLaughlin was the epitome of what it means to be a member of the greatest generation. He worked hard, served his country, raised a family, and gave back to society more than he could have ever received in return. Born in Braxton County, WV, in 1918, Kemp, as his family and friends called him, was raised during the Great Depression, and like many others of his generation, he learned the value of a day's work, to be thankful for what you have, and most importantly, how to survive in the face of adversity. After high school, he traveled to Morgantown to attend college at West Virginia University, where his interest in military service and aviation were first piqued when the Army Air Corps testing team visited the school's campus. A year later, he enlisted in the U.S. Army at the age of 21. A year into his enlistment, the Japanese attacked the U.S. Naval Base at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, HI, on December 7, 1941. It was not only ``a date which will live in infamy,'' as President Roosevelt so memorably declared, but it was also Kemp's 23rd birthday. Soon after, he was deployed to England as a copilot and second lieutenant in the Mighty Eight's 92nd Bombardment Group, flying the B-17 bomber. The unit's mission was to carry out strategic bombing campaigns in France and Germany during World War II. During his first mission in France, his aircraft took multiple direct hits. McLaughlin returned fire, engaged in air-to-air combat, and eventually took down the enemy. This, in addition to his 38 other combat missions during World War II, were some of the most pivotal air raids in our country's military history. The successful mission he took part in to bomb facilities in Norway is credited with halting Germany's efforts to produce an atomic bomb and potentially saved millions of lives. Upon returning to the United States in 1945, McLaughlin was recognized with numerous medals and awards, including the Distinguished Flying Cross with three clusters, the Air Corps Air Medal with eight clusters, the French Croix de Guerre, and a Presidential unit citation. He then accepted a commission as a lieutenant colonel before initially retiring in 1946, a retirement that would last 1 year, when he was asked to serve as the first commander of the West Virginia Air National Guard squadron. After the unit's service in the Korean war, he was promoted to full colonel and appointed as West Virginia's assistant adjutant general. McLaughlin was then promoted again in 1962 to brigadier general and continued to serve in leadership positions with the Air Guard until his retirement in 1977. In addition to serving his Nation in uniform, Kemp also served his community as a Kanawha County Commissioner from 1962 to 1968 and then again from 1974 to 1976, when he was appointed to serve in the West Virginia House of Delegates. Even after he retired from both his military and public life, Kemp continued to give back to his community and the Air Guard. In recognition of his contributions to the West Virginia Air National Guard, the Charleston base was fittingly renamed McLaughlin Air National Guard Base during a ceremony I was honored to attend in January 2014. In West Virginia, we are extremely proud of our military heroes, of which we have many. However, very few have had the impact on our State's military institutions and their reputation across the country as Brig. Gen. James Kemp McLaughlin. I am honored to have known him, West Virginia is fortunate to call him one of our own, and our Nation is forever thankful for his honorable service. Together, we grieve the loss of one of our greatest.<bullet>   "
597,Benjamin Cardin,1.5162440538406372,D,cardin,cardin," Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we need to pass the Combating Global  Corruption Act. Today, I join with my colleague Senator Young to  reaffirm bipartisan support for this important legislation.  Corruption threatens international stability and security and poses a  serious threat to democracy and democratic values. Ten days ago,  December 9, was International AntiCorruption Day. This day provides an  annual reminder of the dire need to prioritize combatting corruption  here in the United States and around the world.  Corruption undermines democratic institutions, it compromises the  rule of law, and it erodes human rights protections. It damages  America's global competitiveness and hampers economic growth in global  markets. It fosters the conditions for violent extremism and weakens  institutions associated with governance and accountability. These are  direct threats to our national and international security.  Earlier this year, Transparency International published its  Corruption Perceptions Index for 2018. It underscored that the failure  to curb corruption is contributing to a worldwide crisis of democracy.  Not surprisingly then, Freedom House similarly reported that 2018 was  marked by global declines in political rights and civil liberties for  the 13th consecutive year. Sixty-eight countries suffered net declines  in political rights and civil liberties during 2018, with only 50  nations registering gains.  We have all seen the headlines in recent years--from scandals in  Liberia, Hungary, and Guatemala, to the doping by Russian athletes and  their subsequent ban from the 2016 Summer Olympics and using aid to  influence other nations' behavior.  It is clear that where there are high levels of corruption, we find  fragile states, authoritarian states, or states suffering from internal  or external conflict--in places such as Lebanon, Afghanistan and  Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Nigeria, and Sudan.  Different domestic issues may have sparked the wave of massive  protests we are observing today--whether they be increases in gas  prices or metro fares--but many of these uprisings have been sustained  by public desire to weed out leaders' corruption. Corruption is no  longer being tolerated or excused.  Corruption operates via extensive and entrenched networks in both the  public and private sectors. It is ubiquitous and pervasive, but we must  address it. The costs of not addressing it or rooting it out are just  too great.  Mr. President, we must be clear-eyed--any fight against corruption  will be long-term and difficult. It is a fight against powerful people,  powerful companies, and powerful interests. It is about changing a  mindset and a culture as much as it is about establishing and enforcing  laws.  While previous anti-corruption legislation has been crucial, the  Combatting Global Corruption Act takes our commitment to this value  further by bringing a whole-of-government approach to the issue and  bringing more transparency to the instances of corruption going on  unnoticed in every country around the world.  The Combatting Global Corruption Act requires the State Department to  produce an annual assessment, either by a briefing or by a report,  similar to the Trafficking in Persons Report, which takes a close look  at each country's efforts to combat corruption. The assessment will  measure indicators such as transparency, accountability, enforcement of  anti-corruption laws, and the extent to which public power is used for  private gain.  That model, which has effectively advanced the effort to combat  modern-day slavery, will similarly embed the issue of corruption in our  collective work and make other nations more conscious of their  corruption levels.  The bill includes clear definitions of corruption and corrupt  activities and underscores the importance of prioritizing corruption  into strategic planning--across our agencies, bureaus, and our missions  overseas.  It specifically increases coordination on anti-corruption efforts  between the Department of State and USAID and formally engages our  embassies in the fight against corruption by establishing anti- corruption points of contact at our Embassies in critical countries.  We work across multiple agencies and in multiple offices to combat  corruption. The roles of these points of contact, comprised of either  the chief of mission or personnel designated for the role by the chief  of mission, will foster greater coordination on anticorruption efforts  within the U.S. government.  It is time for the U.S. Congress to send a strong message to our  Nation and to the world that corruption cannot be accepted as the  status quo.  It is time that we back up our words--our commitment to supporting  democratization, human rights, and fairness globally--with action to  protect those critically important values. Let's pass the Combating  Global Corruption Act.    "
598,Thomas Carper,0.6317200064659119,D,carper,carper," Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want to share with the Senate my reasons  for opposing the nomination of Aurelia Skipwith to serve as the  Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Let me begin by saying that I am disappointed to find myself in this  position. When I had the privilege of serving as Governor of Delaware,  I was able to assemble my own leadership team, so I appreciate how  important it is that people in executive positions, including  Presidents, have that same ability.  However, in article II of the Constitution, our Founders set up a  system in which the President would nominate individuals to the top  posts in our government and Senators would provide ``advice and  consent'' on those nominees.  In order for the Senate to fulfill that constitutional role, those  nominated individuals must cooperate with the confirmation process.  And, unfortunately, Ms. Skipwith has not provided information requested  by the Democrats during the nomination process.  Despite my repeated requests for the nominee to be more forthcoming-- requests made twice in writing and twice in person. during her  nomination process--Ms. Skipwith has refused. Instead, she has given me  the impression that she does not take this confirmation process  seriously.  Her lack of candor has elevated questions that already existed about  her qualifications, her commitment to environmental conservation and  whether she can ethically lead the Fish and Wildlife Service.  Therefore, I cannot support this nomination.  Ms. Skipwith first joined the Trump administration in April 2017.  when she was appointed as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Fish and  Wildlife and Parks, a non-Senate-confirmed political appointment at the  Department of the Interior.  During her tenure there, the Fish and Wildlife Service proposed and  finalized controversial regulations that drastically altered  implementation of the Endangered Species Act.  The Service has also issued a legal opinion that changes the way the  Department of the Interior enforces the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.  Former senior Interior officials from every administration since the  early 1970s, both Republican and Democrat, have strongly opposed this  Migratory Bird Treaty Act legal opinion. At her confirmation hearing,  Ms. Skipwith vehemently defended it.  Prior to her controversial tenure at the Interior Department, Ms.  Skipwith had no previous work experience related to conservation or  wildlife management--none.  By contrast, the 16 individuals who previously served as Fish and  Wildlife Service Directors for both Republican and Democratic  Presidents had an estimated average of 12 years of experience at the  Fish and Wildlife Service before taking on the Director role. They also  have an estimated average of more than 22 years of professional  experience in fields related to wildlife or fisheries management.  Ms. Skipwith has also not seemed to make up for her lack of previous  experience while on the job. At her confirmation hearing, when asked to  name the conservation scientist who had most influenced her career and  her approach to wildlife and fisheries management, Ms. Skipwith  struggled to name any conservation scientist. Ultimately, she named a  former Monsanto vice president with whom she used to work, but she  misremembered his name.  This was not an insignificant misstep. To me, it was revealing. Ms.  Skipwith's response to my simple question represented a clear lack of  familiarity with the basics of wildlife management, a troubling quality  for a Fish and Wildlife Director nominee.  By contrast, Ms. Skipwith does have significant experience in the  agribusiness industry. Before joining the Trump administration, she  worked for Monsanto, one of the world's largest agrochemical firms.  Monsanto regularly has business interests before the Interior  Department. She also worked for Alltech, a Kentucky-based agricultural  products company.  She also co-founded AVC Global, an agribusiness-technology start up,  and was employed by Gage International, a Washington, DC, based  lobbying firm founded by her fiance.  That is why even before her confirmation hearing, I asked Ms.  Skipwith some basic questions about how these companies operate and [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7009"">Page S7009</a>, ] whether Ms. Skipwith has recused herself from working on those issues.  Unfortunately, Ms. Skipwith has refused to answer those questions.  She has repeatedly refused to provide her calendars with the  appointments she has had as a Department of the Interior official. This  information could be made available to any member of the public under  the Freedom of Information Act, but she has refused to provide it to me  for months within the confirmation process.  This information is important because Ms. Skipwith's former employer,  Gage International, has represented water utilities that have lobbied  Congress to weaken Western water policy and the Endangered Species Act.  Unanswered questions also remain about Ms. Skipwith's role in the  development of a controversial repeal of an existing ban on using  pesticides that have been shown to harm birds and bees in national  wildlife refuges. And one of the largest producers of these pesticides  is Monsanto, another one of Ms. Skipwith's former employers.  Yet when Senator Gillibrand asked Ms. Skipwith about her role in the  ban's repeal, Ms. Skipwith defended the reversal but denied any role in  the decision. This answer does not appear to be consistent with some of  the email records that have been obtained under Freedom of Information  Act, which show that she expressed interest in the matter and received  materials on the issue from career staff.  If Ms. Skipwith was indeed involved with the decision to reverse the  pesticides ban, it would constitute a violation of the ethics pledge  she signed when she joined the Department. An examination of Ms.  Skipwith's calendar entries could clear up these outstanding questions,  but her lack of cooperation makes that impossible.  This lack of being forthcoming is troubling, not only because it  undermines the Senate's advice and consent role for Presidential  nominees, but it also because it demonstrates the nominee's may not be  cooperative when it comes to congressional oversight.  I have found that, when a nominee is unwilling to provide information  as part of their confirmation process, they almost always prove to be  even more defiant to congressional oversight requests after they are  confirmed.  I urge my colleagues. especially my Republican colleagues, to take  this matter seriously. In fact, I would urge my Republican colleagues  to remember these words spoken by my friend, former Congressman Trey  Gowdy of South Carolina.  In June 2012, during the House Oversight and Government Reform  Committee contempt proceedings against Attorney General Holder, then  Congressman Gowdy said: ``The notion that you can withhold information  and documents from Congress no matter whether you are the party in  power or not in power is wrong. Respect for the rule of law must mean  something, irrespective of the vicissitudes of political cycles.''  Eventually, whether it is in 1 year or in 4 years or in 8, we will  eventually have another Democratic administration. And when that time  comes, Republicans in Congress will want officials in that Democratic  administration to answer questions and respond to congressional  oversight requests.  I fear that my Senate colleagues will find the process completely  broken by then if we continue undermining our duty as Senators to both  provide advice and consent on Presidential nomination and to conduct  congressional oversight.  This clear defiance of our sworn constitutional duty and  congressional oversight role diminishes the Senate, weakens our  intricate system of checks and balances, and undermines the trust of  the American people.  Beyond her lack of qualifications and her questionable role in some  of this administration's major conservation policies, there are too  many troubling concerns and questions about this nominee that remain  unaddressed or unanswered.  Therefore, I will be opposing this nomination, and I encourage my  colleagues to do the same.    "
599,Robert Casey,1.32082998752594,D,casey,casey," Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of 1LT  Michael Cleary from Dallas, PA. It has been 14 years since his death.  Michael is one of some 288 Pennsylvanians killed in action in the wars  in Iraq and Afghanistan.  First Lieutenant Cleary served as platoon leader of the Explosive  Ordnance Disposal Team in E Company, 1st of the 15th Regiment, 3rd  Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division of the U.S. Army.  On December 20, 2005, First Lieutenant Cleary was killed in action  while working in a bomb factory near Samarra, Iraq. His platoon was  ambushed outside the facility. He was just 24 years old.  Even prior to joining the Army, Michael Cleary was an active member  of his community. He graduated from Dallas Senior High School in  Dallas, PA, and was a 4-year varsity athlete in both soccer and tennis.  He was captain of both teams in his senior year. He received the Dr.  Pepper Soccer MVP Scholarship and a history scholarship at high school  graduation and was offered academic scholarships at Ursinus College,  Gettysburg, as well as Dickinson and Lafayette--all very strong  academic institutions of higher education in Pennsylvania.  He followed his father's footsteps and chose Hamilton College in New  York. While at Hamilton, First Lieutenant Cleary participated in  varsity soccer and lettered in varsity tennis. After the September 11,  2001, attacks on our Nation, he wanted to enlist in the Special Forces  but chose to follow the advice of his mother and stayed in school until  completing his studies.  In May 2003, he graduated from Hamilton with honors. During his  senior year, he applied to and was accepted into the Marine flight  officer program. He was notified that his class would be deferred until  January. Not wanting to wait any longer to serve his country, Michael  Cleary decided to enlist in the U.S. Army. Three weeks after college  graduation, he went to basic training and earned his airborne wings and  sapper tab and graduated from the Special Air Service Antiterrorist  Course.  The news of First Lieutenant Cleary's death came just before he was  scheduled to return home during the Christmas season. He was also  planning to get married 2 months after he returned home to his high  school sweetheart. First Lieutenant Cleary earned the following awards  and decorations: the Army Achievement Medal, National Defense Service  Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army  Service Ribbon, and Overseas Service Ribbon. His family also received  First Lieutenant Cleary's U.S. Army Bronze Star and Purple Heart.  Following his death, First Lieutenant Cleary's father, Jack,  described his last conversation with his son the day before he died.  Jack Cleary is someone I have gotten to know since his son's passing,  but here is what Jack said at that time. I am quoting him directly.  ``He''--meaning Michael--``was very upset that they were sending home  some of his men without their awards . . . for things like promotions,  and he was fighting for his men. That is the kind of officer he was.  Michael was a fine man. He cared about all people, great and small.''  Jack Cleary knows of what he speaks because he, himself, served in  Vietnam and, as I mentioned earlier, was also a graduate of the same  college. 1LT Michael Cleary's legacy lives on with his family. His  mother, Marianne, is a member of Gold Star Mothers where she works to  support veterans, military families, and her community every day.  Jon Bellona, Michael's college roommate, is a director and founder of  the 1LT Michael Joseph Cleary: Run for the Fallen, a run across America  to raise awareness about the lives of those who fought to activate  their memories and to keep their spirits alive. Run for the Fallen  supports organizations that help wounded veterans, as well as the  families of those killed, and helps aid the healing process for those  Americans whose lives have been affected by war.  All Americans are grateful for the friends and family of fallen  servicemembers who not only continue the legacy of service to the  Nation, but who take their tragedy and turn it into a force for good.  1LT Michael Cleary is one of so many bright, talented, and dedicated  young men and women who have died in service to our country. While I  speak specifically of Michael today, his story is the story of  thousands of men and women across our country, hundreds of them in  Pennsylvania who have given their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan and  also have given their lives in service of American values, values like  democracy and liberty and rule of law.  As we remember Michael Cleary, we should also remember the words of  Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln reminded us that people like Michael  Cleary gave, as Lincoln said, ``The last full measure of devotion to  our country.'' It is at times like this when we should remember not  only those words, but also other words from the Gettysburg Address,  where he said, ``It is us, the living, rather, to be dedicated here to  the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly  advanced.''  So that was our charge from President Lincoln all those generations  ago. We must strive every day, whether we are citizens or public  officials, whatever our station in life, we must strive every day to  complete that unfinished work that Lincoln talked about, so that, as we  discuss major security issues like U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan or  combating the resurgence of ISIS in the Middle East or exercising  oversight over U.S. military engagements overseas and look increasingly  to try to resolve complicated global crises, we must not forget that  those who have given the ultimate sacrifice and service to our country,  particularly in the most recent wars, are those we should remember.  Just consider these numbers of Americans who have lost their lives in  the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, with an additional seven killed in  African Command operations since 2001. That number is 6,989 Americans  just in those conflicts, just in that timeframe. These 6,989 Americans  includes some 300 servicemembers from Pennsylvania, the fifth highest  total of any State. No. 2, over 49,000 in that time period have been  wounded, including more than roughly 2,000 from Pennsylvania. So 6,989  killed since 2001 nationwide and over 49,000 wounded in that time  period.  Third, although the administration refuses to be transparent in its  deployment tracking, press reports indicate that approximately 19,000  Americans are currently serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, with an  additional 65,000 serving the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia.  This year, Pennsylvania lost MSG Benjamin Hines of York County, PA,  assigned to the 25th Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division, Marine  Forces Reserve. He was killed by a roadside bomb on April 8 in Parwan  Province, Afghanistan, along with two other marines: SSG Christopher  Slutman and SGT Robert Hendricks. Staff Sergeant Slutman also had  family ties to my home State of Pennsylvania.  While we are so grateful that Pennsylvania did not suffer more losses  this year, any loss of life is not only devastating, but should also  cause us to reconsider the nature of our military commitments overseas.  These fighting men and women are born into families, [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7017"">Page S7017</a>, ] not into divisions and brigades. They are sons and daughters, husbands  and wives, fathers and mothers. Their love for their families are  matched only by their devotion to our country, but many more bear the  scars of war.  Some families have a loved one who served in Iraq or Afghanistan and  were returned home, but who were one of the more than 49,000 who were  wounded. We must not overlook the unusually high percentage of Iraq and  Afghanistan veterans who have died since returning home, whether from a  drug overdose or suicide or the effects of combat. Thousands of  American families continue to pay a terrible price for the courage and  dedication of their family members who gave life and limb for this  country.  We have much to think about, not only on this day, but, of course, in  this season--this season of hope, this season of gratitude, this season  of our time together with our families back home, but we should  especially remember those families who have loved and lost, those who  have lost someone in combat, those who have lost someone who served so  nobly, served on behalf of the rest of us.  At this time, Mr. President, I know you have personal experience with  this, having served yourself, and I know that you understand this. It  is an important time to remember those who have given so much for our  country, with the spirit of gratitude for their service, hope that we  don't have more losses in the coming year, and with confidence that  they have set a great example for us.  I yield the floor.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    "
600,Bill Cassidy,1.0840020179748535,R,cassidy,cassidy," Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the spending bill,  which we are about to vote on, which is going to increase our deficit  by almost a fourth of a trillion dollars over 10 years and of which I  think I might be the first speaker. We are going to vote on this. We  got it yesterday--Monday, maybe--and we are going to vote on it  tomorrow.  I smile because this is supposed to be the world's greatest  deliberative body, and we have not deliberated one bit on far-ranging  policies. Now, by the why, the mess is kind of bipartisan. We can  spread the blame around.  Let me bring up the heart of it. When ObamaCare passed, President  Obama famously said it would not increase the deficit by one dime. That  is gone. I think that replaces ``you can keep your doctor if you want  to'' as the greatest lie. What we did today is to repeal about $400  billion in payments to pay for all the healthcare that is going out. It  is kind of a joke on Republicans. We are getting ObamaCare, but we are  not paying for it.  On the other hand, as I will explain in a second, it may ultimately  be a joke on Democrats. Now, this concerns me because we didn't have a  committee hearing on it, and we haven't had a floor debate, but we just  committed that for almost $400 billion that have been used to fund  Medicaid expansion, people getting subsidies for their health  insurance, and many other things, we just went poof, and it is gone.  Now, some of it, like the health insurance tax, was a tax that the  insurance industry agreed to so that the Obama administration would  force ObamaCare upon the rest of us. But now that it has been agreed to  and ObamaCare is stuck, they don't want to pay the tax. They would  rather that go poof.  Now, people say: Wait a second. If we get rid of that tax, maybe  insurance premiums go down. One, they don't guarantee it, but,  secondly, what we could have done is we could have taken that money,  created reinsurance pools across the Nation, and that is estimated to  lower premiums by 10 to 20 percent. In that case, not only would the  insurance industry be fulfilling their bargain--hey, you stick the  Nation with ObamaCare, but we will help pay for it--you would actually  be able to use the money to lower premiums. That would be something  good. One, they would have kept their word, and, two, it would have  been good for the American patient, if you will.  The other tax that has gone just poof--$300 billion just gone without  debate, without deliberation, without a committee hearing, which is  still there on Friday, and today we walk in on Monday, and it is poof,  and we vote on it tomorrow, and I am the first person to speak on it-- is the so-called Cadillac tax.  Now, on the Cadillac tax, that is a provision under ObamaCare in  which for high-cost policies, if they go too high, you get taxed on  them. The whole idea is to encourage wiser purchasing of health  insurance. Now, frankly, I didn't care for the Cadillac tax. I get the  reason it was there. But 100 different economists have said that it  serves a purpose across the political spectrum. My preference is that  if we had replaced the Cadillac tax, one, we would have paid for it. We  shouldn't be getting ObamaCare without paying for it. Secondly, we  would have gotten [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7146"">Page S7146</a>, ] some reforms. They are reforms that actually would have been--if we  were not going to use the Cadillac tax to hold down the cost of  premiums--another mechanism by which we could hold down the cost of  premiums.  Why is this important? Because not only did we just go poof to almost  $400 billion, but because healthcare expenditures are driving our debt  and deficit. It is not just that we lost this $400 billion. We lost any  restraint upon policies going higher and higher.  Now, that is bad for the American patient. It is bad for the American  household because our country will continue its indebtedness.  I am a doctor. I know if you put more money into the furnace, it will  burn that much higher, and now there is just no excuse to try and rein  in those expensive policies.  It is not just that. One thing that my Republicans apparently have  agreed with Democrats on is to stop the Trump administration from  taking on something called ``silver loading.'' It is a little technical  here, but just hang with me. For the middle-class family in your State  who buys their insurance on the exchange and does not get a subsidy,  pop, there goes their premium.  How does this happen? When the Trump administration ended the  payments from the Federal Government to insurance companies, insurance  companies figured out a way around it. They are smart. They know how to  get out of taxes that they have agreed to pay for, as an example. So  they did what is called ``silver loading.'' They increased the cost of  so-called silver policies on the ObamaCare exchange. So if you are not  getting a subsidy, you are paying a lot more. But because if you are  not getting a subsidy and you are paying a lot more, that increased the  amount of subsidies for people who were. So if you are, you know,  getting a subsidy, you are probably pleased with it. If you are the  middle-class person making 400 percent of Federal poverty level and you  are paying your taxes and you are trying to do it right, you just got  stuck with a higher premium.  The administration was trying to take it on. This deal, which we have  not discussed, which was not heard in committee, which we have not  deliberated on at all, says to the administration: You can't take that  on. Yes, that middle class family not getting a subsidy is paying far  more, but you can't take it on. Stand down, administration, we are  going to stick it to that family, as well as saying poof to $400  billion.  Now, there are some other issues that are important to me in my  State. The National Flood Insurance Program is an important program. We  advanced some reforms that would make it more affordable for the  homeowner, more sustainable for society, and more accountable to the  taxpayer. We haven't had anything in there. We renewed it. I am pleased  that we renewed it.  We renewed it without reforms. You have had flooding in your State,  and I have had flooding in my State. You have had yours in yours, and I  have had it in mine. We need that program to be sustainable,  accountable, and affordable. We have lost the opportunity. I forget how  many short-term extensions we have had without reform. I think it is  like 10, 12, 14, or 16. You lose count after a while. We have missed  that opportunity.  So we started on Friday. Everybody goes home except for a few people.  They work on it over the weekend, they come in on Monday, and we get a  2,000-page bill on Monday. We will vote on it tomorrow, and I am the  first person to speak on it.  Now, I understand that impeachment is taking a lot of energy and  oxygen out of the Chambers. I understand that a lot of attention is  addressed elsewhere, but all I can say is that you have just imperiled  your country's fiscal health.  On one more thing before I wrap up, there is a little bit of an irony  here. Republicans are getting ObamaCare, but it is unpaid for. There is  another irony here as well. The courts today ruled that the individual  mandate in ObamaCare is unconstitutional. Now, I am not an attorney,  but I gather they did not rule that this was so-called severable.  If this is not constitutional, then the rest can stand because we  just sever it off. Imagine this. Imagine that the courts decide that  that portion of ObamaCare--which is related to Medicaid expansion and  is related to the exchanges in which people get subsidies to buy these  policies--is unconstitutional but would have allowed the mechanism by  which to pay for it to stand, because that is another part of the law.  We have just repealed that. Why is that important? Because if this  falls, we have to have the money to pay for a replacement.  Democrats have so long screamed that we need to have universal  access. By the way, I am a doc. I would like everybody to have  insurance. I fought for it, and I worked for it. But the other party,  which has said this is such a high priority, has just eliminated the  funding that could be used for replacement in Texas v. Azar, the court  decision that may strike down that portion of ObamaCare.  So, Republicans, we got ObamaCare that is not paid for. Democrats,  they may end up with no ObamaCare at all. Patients, whether they are on  Medicaid, getting a subsidy, or not getting a subsidy, will lose.  I hope that we can return to being the world's greatest deliberative  body, but as regards that, this has to be considered a low point.  I yield the floor.    "
601,Susan Collins,1.3333159685134888,R,collins,collins," Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:37 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, December 23, 2019, at 10 a.m.    "
602,Susan Collins,1.3333159685134888,R,collins,collins," Mrs. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from  Arizona, Senator Sinema, in introducing legislation to support the  operation of a national child abuse hotline. Of all the major national  help hotlines, the crisis line for child abuse and neglect, which is  currently operated by a national nonprofit, is the only one without a  federal authorization and dedicated federal funding. Our bill, the  National Child Abuse Help Hotline Act of 2020, would give the  Administration for Children and Families the authority to award a grant  to a national nonprofit to support a hotline dedicated to the  prevention and intervention of child abuse and neglect. The child abuse  and neglect crisis happening across the United States has only been  exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.  On average, five children die every day from child abuse and neglect.  According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Child  Maltreatment Report, which was published in January 2020 and reflects  2018 figures, 678,000 children were victims of maltreatment in 2018 and  a heartbreaking 1,770 children died--including three in Maine. These  statistics reflect an unfortunate increase in both child fatalities and  victims of maltreatment, and is the first increase for the number of  victims who suffered maltreatment since 2015.  Access to prevention and intervention services nationwide has only  become more critical in the face of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The  current crisis threatens to severely exacerbate child abuse and  neglect, and a number of experts predict that child abuse is currently  being underreported. In Maine, when schools closed their doors on March  16 and stay-at-home orders went in place, calls to Maine Child and  Family Services decreased immediately, falling 32 percent in the first  month. Of note, only seven percent of calls were from school personnel,  which is a dramatic drop from the 22 percent of teachers and other  school staff--more than any other group--who call in typically to  report abuse and neglect.  With stay-at-home orders, school closures, and high unemployment,  families are experiencing financial stress, isolation, and new  anxieties at the very time when children have less exposure to  mandatory reporters--such as teachers, physicians, and coaches--and  safe environments where one may normally escape or seek help. In April,  Dr. Larry Ricci, a child abuse pediatrician at Spurwink, located in  Portland, Maine, said ``our sense is that not only is abuse still  happening at the same rate it was happening before, in all likelihood  it has increased.'' Dr. Ricci pointed out that ``We've known for many  years that the abuse rate mirrors the unemployment rate.'' And as  Michelle Fingerman, Vice President for Childhelp, a national nonprofit  and the current operator of the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline  located in Arizona, details: ``There is a wide range of fallout from  pandemic anxiety and school shutdowns. There is more abuse already  occurring in homes where caregivers are melting down from the stress,  children are trapped at home with abusers, schools and daycare are  closed, and therapists and other frontline providers are now more  difficult to access.''  During a time when children are not going to school, day care, or  family resource centers, and, therefore, traditional resources may not  be as easily accessible, the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline is  a resource that is accessible to children and families across the  country. The hotline, 1-800-4-A-CHILD, saw call volume increase by 33  percent from February to May. Childhelp's text and online chat  platform, which is supported by a $1 million ACF Innovation Grant that  I have advocated for as a member of the Appropriations Committee,  experienced a 66 percent increase in outreach since February.  The helpline importantly serves a wide range of individuals in every  single state--at-risk children, distressed parents seeking crisis  intervention, and concerned individuals who suspect that child abuse  may be occurring. In Maine, where one in every 71 children is a victim  of abuse, the National Child Abuse Hotline assisted nearly 200 callers  in fiscal year 2019. Those in need are connected--either on the phone  or by text or online chat--with masters-level social workers who are  there to offer confidential crisis intervention and information,  literature, and referrals to emergency, social service, and support  resources.  The bill we are introducing today would provide a small but  meaningful federal investment to protect children across the country-- authorizing $1 million annually for the Administration for Children and  Families (ACF) to award a grant to a nonprofit entity to support a 24- hour, national, toll-free telephone hotline that will provide  information and assistance to victims of [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S4547"">Page S4547</a>, ] child abuse or neglect, parents, caregivers, mandated reporters, and  other concerned community members. This does not interfere with any  state-mandated reporter hotlines and can be a resource for these  individuals. In fact, the current operator has more than 80 community  partners in just Maine alone.  The helpline's dedication to the prevention and intervention of child  abuse and neglect is both successful and well-documented, and more  federal support for this resource will improve our ability to reach  children of all ages, as well as parents or caregivers in need. During  a time when these supports are needed more there an ever, I believe the  existing infrastructure and experience of the National Child Abuse  Hotline should be used. Even with just more outreach and  communications, we could better support the needs of children and  families during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and economic recovery.  Action and investment now can help prevent the worst possible outcome-- letting children fall through the cracks during an already traumatizing  crisis.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to put the welfare of our  nation's children at the forefront of our national Covid-19 response  and to support the adoption of this important legislation, which will  benefit children and families in the age of Covid-19, as well as after  this pandemic passes.  Thank you, Mr. President.    "
603,Susan Collins,1.3333159685134888,R,collins,collins," Mr. COLLINS. Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, it has been interesting, the discussion on the floor  today. It has been interesting on both sides to hear the different  aspects of why this bill is on the floor, why we are doing it, why we  shouldn't be doing it, and many things. It has been interesting, the  discussion, if you go from a strictly number-of-States category.  What has been interesting is my colleagues across the aisle have  talked about that there are now 38 States, but they fail to mention 5  States that rescinded their votes. Five States would put you under 38.  What was interesting to me in the Rules Committee the other night,  the argument was that, if they rescind it, it is not valid to rescind,  yet you can add States after the time limit is up. That is an  interesting argument to make if you are actually looking at it from the  perspective of if they rescind it within the timeframe yet passed it  after the timeframe, that that is okay.  Then I heard one of my colleagues actually mentioned the fact that,  if we passed it in here today, that this would now become part of the  process, along with the State of Virginia ratifying it, it is now part  of our Constitution.  I am sure this was just a euphoric discussion about how this would  actually go about, but they were also forgetting the Senate is involved  in this. It is amazing.  I was really worried at one point in the discussion that it was said  on multiple occasions that there was no protection in the Constitution  for women. I was almost scared for a moment that the 14th Amendment had  been repealed and I didn't know it.  It is in there and still is in there. I checked just a few minutes  ago. It is safe.  It is interesting to determine, when Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the  foremost architects in looking at this bill even in the 1970s, coming  forward, has said: If you want to do this, start over. Do it the proper  way.  As my chairman has said earlier, basically, a deadline should not get  in the way of what we want. A deadline should not get in the way of  what I want to have happen. That is becoming more and more of a concern  in this body, that the rules and parliamentary procedures don't matter  if it interferes with what we want.  But, at the end of the day, the question really becomes: Why are we  doing this? Why are we bringing this forth when there is absolutely no  legal precedent, no constitutional precedent, no anything out there-- including some of the founders who actually started this whole process  40-plus years ago, who said this is not the way you do it.  The reason I know that that is a concern is because some of those who  have actually said this have been criticized in the media from the  perspective of supporters of the ERA to say Ruth Bader Ginsburg's  comments have now killed the ERA, or effectively done it. The reason is  because she is speaking the truth about this issue.  We disagree on most everything from a legal perspective, but on this  one, we happen to agree, and she has laid forth clearly what should  happen here.  But let me also say--and it has been talked about a great deal, so I  think we just need to come to the real scenario why this is happening.  It is not that we believe it will actually happen. For anybody here who  believes that today is actually going to put it in part of the  Constitution, that is not going to happen.  So what is it? It is a political nod to the understanding of those  who are speaking for this.  As we have heard earlier, NARAL Pro-Choice America:  With its ratification, the ERA would reinforce the   constitutional right to abortion by clarifying that the sexes   have equal rights, which would require judges to strike down   anti-abortion laws.  Also, NARAL:  The ERA will support protecting women's right to abortion.   With five anti-choice Justices on the Supreme Court and Roe   v. Wade on the chopping block, it is more important than ever   we codify women's bodily autonomy in our lives.  Codirector of Reproaction:  Abortion restrictions amount to sex discrimination because   they single out people for unfair treatment on the basis of   sex.  The senior counsel of National Women's Law Center:  The ERA would help create a basis for challenging abortion   restrictions.  This is what this is actually about. This is what the basis has  needed because there has been a shifting in this [["", Page , H1140, ] country to understand that, in our opinion--in the opinion of many-- abortion is simply murder in the womb. It is not about life.  It is interesting, we are talking about the rights of women today-- which, again, this bill doesn't have anything to do with--but we are  not concerned if the young women in the womb are even able to have a  birthday. That is not a concern.  So what would happen from these folks who are supporting your  resolution today? Why do they want it? Because it gives a claim, from  start to finish, unfettered abortion.  So what does that mean? That means let's bring back partial-birth  abortion, which, if I have to remind anybody here, means the delivery  of the child all the way until the moment the chin comes almost out,  and then actually crushing their skull. That is what that is.  If that is a right we are protecting, I don't want any part of it,  and neither do most Americans. They don't want a part of it. But that  is one of those restrictions that will be laid back.  It would also continue to allow unlimited abortions in any State for  any reason, including sex selection.  It is interesting that we would talk about this today, the ERA, and  use this, yet a family could choose to abort a child because it is a  male or a female. Let's be honest about this.  But the bottom line for me, what really bothers me the most about  when it is unlimited, unfettered access to abortion that this bill  opens up, if it were to have passed, is one that hits close to home for  me.  You see, a European country recently stated that a geneticist in  Iceland said: We have almost basically eradicated Down syndrome people.  I thought to myself, for a second: That would be great. I mean, if we  could actually remove Down syndrome and help those and cure that, that  would be an amazing medical discovery for all people. Except there is  one portion.  Do you know how they have done it? Through genetic testing and  killing the children in the womb. They don't even let them have a  birthday.  One Icelandic counselor counsels mothers as follows:  This is your life. You have the right to choose how your life will  look. She said: We don't look at abortion as murder. We look at it as a  thing that we ended.  Do you want to know why this has opened up, America? This is why.  And for those of us like myself who have a disabled child, I do not  want to hear that we are protecting disabled rights and other rights  when we are not even allowing them to be born in certain arenas.  Every day, I get a text on this phone. It is from my daughter. Jordan  is 27 years old. She has spina bifida. She cannot walk and has never  taken a step, and I believe it probably, given the medical condition,  will not happen this side of Heaven. But she rolls and she smiles. She  goes to work 3 days a week. She gets herself up early to put her  clothes on and take her shower and get a bus that she calls, and she  goes to work.  The folks in Sweden, do you know what they want to do? Kill her.  Because she is not as valuable, as a Down syndrome child is not as  valuable.  Do you want to open this Pandora's box of no abortion restrictions?  Then own what you are doing.  But when Jordan texts me, she texts me: Good morning, Daddy. I love  you. How was your day?  Madam Speaker, when we found out 27 years ago--a week ago, 27 years  ago--that Jordan was going to have spina bifida, we were a young couple  just happy that God gave us a child, and to find out that she had a  disability only kept our hearts more in tune to what God had given.  My wife went to school the next week, and she was telling the teacher  about what was going on. She said: We are trying to figure out where we  need to go to have Jordan, help when she is born and get some more  medical attention.  This person looked at her and said: You know you have choices,  correct?''  And my wife said: Well, yes. There is Northside Hospital and others.  She said: No. Oh, no, dear. You don't have to go through with this.  That is your choice.  {time} 1045  In other words, as my wife looked at her and said: ``You're talking  about my baby.''  You see, when we go down this path, don't flower this bill up. Look  at the ones who actually talk about it and say this is an open door to  abortion on demand, with no restrictions, no government interference-- in fact, government pays for it.  But before you do that, America, as we look around, I want you to  think of the picture on the new Gerber baby ad of the young person with  Down syndrome, who is now the face of Gerber baby food. If he was in  Iceland, he would have been one of those that, as it said: Oh, we  ended.  Think about my daughter, who, when we allow it out there for people  who are struggling--and to get news that you have a child with a  disability, that is one of the most amazingly devastating things that  you can hear because you don't know what the future holds.  But what you do know is life is a gift from God, and that it is my  joy to take care of her. We had 30 major surgeries before she was 5  years old, three of which were 9 hours in length. Tell me her life  doesn't matter.  For someone who doesn't have the possibility of understanding, and  they are given a choice because they have a disability, and somebody  tells them and gets to them and says: Don't worry. Disabilities are  bad. Just go ahead and end that life, and go on with your life.  This is what this opens up.  So don't give me a bill that is going nowhere for the reasons that  have been given. The true reasons are found in your own supporters. The  true reasons are found in what we know to be true.  When you understand what this is about, then I will stand till I have  no more breath in my body for the rights of those who can't speak for  themselves.  It is amazing to me that it was said: What would I be saying to my  daughter if I voted against this?  I would be saying to Jordan, as I will: Jordan, the 14th Amendment is  still there. Protections in law are still there. And by the way,  restrictions on abortion will not be done away with, and your life  matters.  So if you want a picture of this, picture Jordan.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
604,Susan Collins,1.3333159685134888,R,collins,collins," Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, in the quest of their further  radical agenda, the left has cast a shadow over an entire town in  Georgia.  This is more than just political fodder here for this floor when the  majority has nothing else to put on this floor and is wasting the  American people's time here. This goes back to disparaging a respected  doctor in the community, an Indian-American immigrant, who provides  free medical services to low-income patients simply for political gain.  The doctor has been viciously slandered by the left's accusation that  he carried out mass hysterectomies.  Frankly, he should sue these organizations.  It is truly sad to see the lengths that the majority is willing to go  to advance their own misguided policies, and they should apologize to  the doctor and to the center.  It is clear to me that Project South has ulterior motives, and it is  dangerous that the majority is permitting the group's complaint to  serve as the foundation of a resolution when so many of the claims have  already failed under scrutiny, and the credibility of the entire  complaint is shattered by Project South's anti-ICE motives.  Despite Democrats' wishes, the American people deserve to know the  truth, and they deserve to see the motives behind the claim. An  investigation is always there; an investigation can start. But it is  pretty amazing that the investigation--173 of my majority colleagues  rushed to sign a letter without even knowing the facts, and especially  because it has salacious details that they could get at ICE and to get  at a system that they don't like, actually protecting the American  public, enforcing our immigration laws.  Project South is an anti-law enforcement organization that has a  stated mission of shutting down detention facilities. They included  patently false claims in a complaint to the DHS IG.  Detention facilities like the Irwin County Detention Center serve an  important purpose in upholding our Nation's immigration laws, and  efforts like this one to disparage them and shut them down by choosing  to ignore facts in favor of fiction is disgraceful, not even meeting  with the hospital administrator.  Again, what are we here for? This is shown to be exactly what it is.  This train is on the tracks. We are putting this up here for political  purposes because, frankly, Madam Speaker, the majority has nothing else  to put up, so let's get a last couple of days in to throw at our  favorite targets: ICE and this administration. And who cares who we  hurt, a hospital, a community, and a doctor who simply was doing his  job.  This is an investigation that needs to happen, and the smear needs to  stop now.    "
605,Susan Collins,1.3333159685134888,R,collins,collins," Mr. COLLINS of New York. Madam Speaker, today I rise to commemorate  the 100th anniversary of Boy Scout Troop 578, one of the oldest troops  in our Nation.  Troop 578 was chartered on September 11, 1919, by the First Church of  Evans in Derby, New York. Historically, they were known as Troop 78,  and, unlike any other Boy Scout troop in America, they remained active  during World War II. During that war, these Scouts were official  dispatch bearers, and they collected recycled metals and other goods to  support the war effort.  In the 1950s, redistricting changes required the troop to add a  number 5 to the 78, making them Troop 578, as they are known today.  As an Eagle Scout myself, I am proud to honor Troop 578 as they  continue to be an important part of the western New York community and  Scouting history. I wish Troop 578 many more active years of Scouting. [[', Page , H7587, ]      "
606,Christopher Coons,0.6241970062255859,D,coons,coons," Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee,  as a member of the Bar Association of Delaware, and a Member of the  U.S. Senate. I am concerned about the transformation of our Federal  judiciary under this current administration. I am particularly  concerned about rising issues around qualification and competency. Let  me speak to that, if I might, for a few minutes.  This Senate is doing precious little in terms of legislating, but we  are moving at a breakneck pace to confirm President Trump's judicial  nominees--roughly, 150 so far. During the entire 8 years of the  previous administration, 55 circuit court judges were confirmed. Nearly  that same number have been confirmed in just 3 years of the Trump  administration--48. Nearly one in seven of all U.S. district court  judges currently serving have been appointed by President Trump.  I am deeply concerned about the quality of some of these nominations.  Some have never taken a deposition, argued a motion, let alone tried a  case in court. The American Bar Association, the professional  association of lawyers, has ranked nine of President Trump's nominees  as ``not qualified,'' which is an exceptionally unusual and striking  step for them to take.  This isn't about whether the President's nominees are conservative or  not. I understand that elections have consequences and that a  Republican President will more often than not nominate conservative  judges. I have, in some cases, joined my Democratic colleagues in  supporting qualified nominees put forward by the administration who  have won support from their home State Senators and advanced through a  bipartisan judicial nomination and confirmation process in our  committee, but let's be clear. I will not stand by while this  administration rams through nominees who are not just Republican and  not just conservative but demonstrably unqualified.  I can't support nominees with deeply concerning records about their  commitment to justice and to advancing a commonsense juris prudence. I  am not going to set a standard any lower than what has been required in  previous administrations to serve on the Federal bench for many, many  years.  We have heard in this Chamber and around this country that the  quality of the Federal bench and the capabilities and the experience  and the values and the judgment of those who serve on Federal benches  across this country is an absolutely essential piece of our  Constitution and our ordered liberty. [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S6876"">Page S6876</a>, ] The cases that come before Federal courts are too important to tolerate  incompetence, inexperience, or bias in the Federal judiciary.  Why does this matter both in terms of the process and the substance?  The President has put forward nominees who, in my view, would take us  backward on civil rights and voting rights, on women's access to  healthcare, on laws that protect consumers and workers, and on the  environment. Their decisions impact every American. Equally concerning  is that Trump's nominees don't reflect the diversity of our Nation. We  want litigants to go into a court and be able to have their day in  court and be confident that the judge before them represents the  breadth and range of America.  So far, of the 55 circuit court nominees confirmed, only 11 have been  women, and they have been even less racially diverse. Of all of  President Trump's nominees, 87 percent are White and 78 percent are  men. I think the judiciary should reflect the diversity of the American  people and have strong records and a wealth of experience. Sadly, that  is not the case for several we have considered, and let me briefly  speak to two.  President Trump's nominee to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of  Appeals, who was recently confirmed, Lawrence VanDyke, raised serious  concerns about his work ethic and his temperament. He was rated ``not  qualified'' by the ABA based on concerns about his lack of knowledge of  basic procedural rules and his commitment to being truthful. Six  retired justices of the Montana Supreme Court questioned his fitness  when he ran for the Supreme Court in Montana and expressed concerns  about his partisanship and the possibility of corporate influence. He  is opposed to basic civil rights and civil liberties for the LGBTQ  community and made a range of statements that I think would be  disqualifying under any circumstance.  Sarah Pitlyk, who this Senate just confirmed this week to a lifetime  seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri,  has never tried a case, either criminal or civil, has never taken a  deposition, has never examined a witness, and has never argued a motion  in Federal or State court. The ABA unanimously rated her as  ``unqualified'' for a lifetime seat in the Federal judiciary.  We can and we should do better than this. Of the entire bar of the  State of Missouri, I am certain there are qualified, capable, and  seasoned conservatives who could have been nominated for that seat in  the entire Ninth Circuit. In particular, the State for which Mr.  VanDyke was nominated, there are certainly abundant opportunities to  choose qualified nominees. We can and we should do better than this.  In my State of Delaware, my senior Senator, Tom Carper, and I worked  together to help form a bipartisan judicial nominating committee to  fill two vacancies on our district court. We felt strongly we had to  reach out to the White House and work with them to identify consensus  nominees who would be the best candidates we could best support and  whom the President could nominate. Ultimately, we had a very productive  process, and the President nominated Maryellen Noreika and Colm  Connolly, whom we both returned positive blue slips for. They  ultimately have been confirmed by this Senate, seated, and now serve in  our district court. This is how the process should work.  We should be able to consult back and forth between the executive and  legislative until we find competent, capable, and qualified judges of  whom we can all be proud of. The Senate should not be a rubberstamp for  this administration, regardless of the quality of nominees that get  sent forward.  I will continue to oppose President Trump's nominees who are  undeserving of a seat on the Federal bench and unqualified to serve. It  is, in my view, our responsibility to guard against the politicization  of the Federal judiciary, and we should work together, not to tear down  and destroy the traditions and rules of this Senate but to find ways to  strengthen and sustain them. That is how we will move qualified and  consensus nominees forward and protect the independent judiciary on  which our very democracy rests.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    "
607,John Cornyn,2.79012393951416,R,cornyn,cornyn," Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, following the longest government shutdown  in history earlier this year, it seemed to be a bipartisan consensus  that we need to get back on track with the regular appropriations  process. Both parties knew there was a funding crisis at stake this  fall if we could not come together and reach a compromise, so this  summer, that is exactly what we did--or at least we thought we did. [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7138"">Page S7138</a>, ]  At the time we reached an agreement that set top-line funding levels  for defense and nondefense spending, there was a promise not to derail  the appropriations process with poison-pill policy riders, and we got  it done in August with plenty of time to spare. It wasn't perfect. No  negotiated product ever is, but we knew this agreement would provide us  the time and the space and the framework to get the appropriations  process back on track and leave room for necessary debate on government  spending habits. As our national deficit continues to grow, that could  not be more critical. I actually remember a time when concern about the  deficit and debt was a bipartisan concern, but apparently, it is not  currently.  Before we hit the first funding deadline, our Democratic colleagues  backed out of the commitment they made in August of 2019. The open  debate we hoped for did not happen. We were forced to pass two short- term funding bills known as continuing resolutions, and now, here we  are, just days away from the current continuing resolutions expiration,  reading text of these funding bills that total nearly $1.4 trillion. We  are reading these for the first time.  When it comes to the appropriations process, I have learned from  experience; you are never going to be 100 percent happy. That is just  the nature of compromise. You have got to weigh the good, the bad, and  the ugly and decide how the scales tip. There is certainly a lot of  calculating when it comes to these appropriation bills, but let me  start with the good. I think the national security appropriations  package goes a long way to rebuilding our military, providing them the  resources they need to maintain readiness, and providing our Armed  Forces with the resources they need to face growing threats around the  world. From adversaries like Russia and China, to rogue regimes like  North Korea and Iran, our military must be prepared to counter a  diverse range of threats.  This funding bill will continue the work of Congress under President  Trump to invest in our military by providing a nearly $20 billion  increase over last year's defense funding levels. It will provide funds  to both modernize and grow our aging fleet so we can continue to send  our troops around the world where they are needed. One of the major  challenges we face is the development of new technologies by our  adversaries. We cannot have our enemies deploying hypersonic glide  vehicles, artificial intelligence, and missile defense systems that  rival or perhaps surpass our own. That would be destabilizing. That may  produce a miscalculation, which would be dangerous.  This bill sends funding toward the research and development of new  technologies so we can stay on the leading edge. We should not be  satisfied with anything other than America being in the lead when it  comes to our national security.  I am glad this package also includes a number of provisions that  support our men and women in uniform, including a 3.1 percent pay  increase, which is the largest in a decade. Above all, this defense  funding answers our commanders' request for steady and predictable  funding so they can address and plan for the threats of today and  prepare for those we will face tomorrow.  In addition to strengthening our national security, this package will  also make our community safer here at home. It sends vital funding to  the Department of Justice law enforcement grant programs and invests  $1.4 billion in the border wall system on the Southwest border. As a  border State Senator, I can tell you the Border Patrol, whom I consider  the experts when it comes to border security, say there are three  components of border security: There is physical infrastructure; there  is technology; and then there is the personnel, the boots on the  ground. This appropriation bill invests $1.4 billion in this system  that includes a border wall.  Despite concerted attempts from our Democratic colleagues, the  President's authorities to transfer funds that he deems necessary for  border security remain intact.  Now, the domestic spending bill takes strides to address some other  challenges. It allows us to bolster our fight against the opioid  epidemic, expand mental health access, and improve our crumbling  transportation infrastructure. It includes $400 million for farmers and  ranchers in Texas and elsewhere affected by drought, trade wars, and  low commodity prices. It would also send an additional half a billion  dollars to the Army Corps of Engineers that can be used for  infrastructure projects right here at home.  With less than a year until the next election, it would provide more  than $400 million in additional funds to safeguard our election systems  so that voters can head to the polls with the confidence that their  vote will be counted correctly.  As we continue to bring down healthcare costs for the American people  by providing them more choice and competition for their premium dollar,  this legislation permanently repeals some of the three most oppressive  ObamaCare taxes that are burdening American families: the premium tax,  the Cadillac tax, and the medical device tax.  This bill also extends funding for critical healthcare programs like  community health centers. This is the safety net in our healthcare  system, the community health center. It is something I have long  supported.  Despite pushes from our colleagues across the aisle, appropriators  also managed to fight off an electric vehicle tax credit expansion,  which would be nothing more than a taxpayer subsidy for wealthy  Americans who want to purchase electric vehicles.  There are a lot of great provisions in these appropriations bills to  address some of our top priorities, but I remain concerned that, with  some of the shortcomings, these could also be described as the bad part  of this appropriation process.  The domestic funding bill includes a range of controversial  provisions that will move us further away from our goal of decreasing  the national debt. It significantly increases deficit spending without  offsets or pay-fors for long-needed reforms for mandatory spending  programs, which are the primary cause of our deficits and debt,  accounting for about 70 percent of Federal spending.  This bill also includes a terrible provision, which is a retroactive  tax on American energy companies. We did this without any sort of  consideration by the committee of jurisdiction--the Finance Committee,  upon which I sit--with no opportunity to provide amendments or even a  debate on this massive retroactive tax. The only choice we are given  now that it has been included as a result of the negotiations among  five people is the choice to vote either up or down on this massive  piece of legislation.  This bill also extends other tax benefits, without addressing  problems with the Tax Code, which actually have a negative impact on  American businesses and families.  This funding bill would also extend the National Flood Insurance  Program, which is long overdue for reforms. This sidesteps the need for  those reforms entirely. The program is hemorrhaging money, and we need  to be looking at ways to improve it, instead of continuing to flush  good money down the drain.  As I mention, we started this process on a strong path with the  budget agreement that was reached in August. I know I wasn't alone in  thinking that would help us get the regular appropriations process back  on track, but things quickly took a turn--not for the good, not for the  bad--but for the ugly. Our colleagues let government funding come  second to their disagreements with the President. They tried to inject  the very poison pills they vowed to steer clear of and derailed the  process that they committed to restoring.  Rather than having an open debate and votes on spending, as we  planned, the process fell to just a handful of people negotiating  behind closed doors. This is reminiscent of the smoke-filled backroom  deals that Congress has long been criticized for, and we really have no  alternative but to vote up or down on this massive $1.4 trillion  spending package without any opportunity to debate it or, more  importantly, to change it by offering amendments.  The way I see it, this has been the plan of Speaker Pelosi and the  minority leader here in the Senate all along. If you think about it,  this really puts the power in their hands, which is exactly what they  want, and they can extract concessions and other things that [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7139"">Page S7139</a>, ] are important to them, rather than allow the process to work as it was  intended to do through regular order, through the regular  appropriations process.  This also takes power from their very own Members because no Democrat  or Republican can offer any amendment to this which can change it at  all under this closed process. So this really isn't just an affront to  the Members on this side of the aisle; it is an affront to their own  Members who have no opportunity to offer amendments or have meaningful  debate and modify the bill.  Our Democratic colleagues have held these appropriations process  hostage for the past several months. Over what? I think that is an  important question. Well, as it turns out, it was their obsession with  .3 percent of our Nation's budget. That is not how this process should  work, and it is certainly not how to make decisions that are in the  best interest of the country.  As further evidence of the rush to get this done without adequate  consideration or debate or amendment, our House Democrats even had to  violate their own 72-hour posting rule for major legislation just to  get this legislation done before we leave this week.  It is frustrating to see our colleagues across the aisle undermine  what could have been a very productive discussion about our Nation's  spending habits, about deficits and debt and what our priorities should  be, and, instead, chose to move forward with these bills, which fall  short in any number of places.  I must say that the majority leader, the Senator from Kentucky, was  committed to a process of getting these appropriations back on track so  we could give a voice to all Members in these negotiations and take  them up in an orderly fashion so amendments could be offered, and they  could be debated and voted on, all of which has now been swept to the  side.  I am also grateful for the tireless work of the chairman of the  Appropriations Committee in the Senate, the Senator from Alabama, Mr.  Shelby, as well as the other members of the committee who have been  negotiating an agreement to support our national defense and avoid  book-ending the 2019 year with a second shutdown.  As we move closer to a vote on these appropriations bills tomorrow, I  am going to continue to review their text. They are massive pieces of  legislation, and we have only recently gotten access to them. I will be  making my individual decision--as I trust each Member will--on whether  to support these appropriations bills and whether they represent the  best interests of their States and of the American people.    "
608,Tom Cotton,0.3681040108203888,R,cotton,cotton," Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, Stephen Carr has been described by friends  as a ``gentle giant'' and ``all-American boy.'' He enjoyed hunting and  fishing. He played on the offensive line at Southwest Baptist  University.  He came from a law enforcement family. He always knew he wanted to be  a police officer, so it was little surprise when Stephen joined the  Fayetteville Police Department 2\\1/2\\ years ago. He served with  professionalism and valor in those 2\\1/2\\ years as a patrol officer in  the Dickson Street entertainment district. [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7021"">Page S7021</a>, ]  Sadly, Officer Carr was in his patrol car Saturday night when he was  ambushed by a gunman looking for an officer to kill. Carr's fellow  police heard the gunshots and responded to the scene within seconds.  With little regard for their own safety, they pursued the gunman down  an alley. When confronted, they met force with force and took him down.  The whole incident took just minutes from start to finish.  Emergency services were on the scene within an instant, but despite  their best efforts, they couldn't save Officer Carr. He succumbed to  his wounds on the scene, as did his killer. Officer Carr was only 27  years old.  This tragedy reminds us of the terrible risks officers face every day  when they put on the uniform and the badge, not knowing whether they  will be alive to take it off that night. Already this year, 118  officers across America have been killed in the line of duty. Some were  the victims of random tragedies. Others, like Officer Carr, were  targeted by a criminal class that hates what the police represent: law  and order.  Since Officer Carr's killing, two more officers have fallen in the  line of duty. Detective Joseph Seals, a 15-year veteran of the Jersey  City Police Department, was shot to death while approaching two  suspected killers. Sergeant Kaila Sullivan, a 16-year veteran of the  Nassau Bay Police Department, was struck and killed by a fleeing  suspect in a vehicle. All of these fallen officers will be remembered  as heroes.  In Arkansas, especially, we will remember Officer Carr, whose watch  ended on December 7, 2019. May he rest in peace.  Honoring Storekeeper 1st Class John William Craig  Mr. President, Navy Storekeeper 1st Class John William Craig of  Monroe, AR, perished aboard the USS Oklahoma on December 7, 1941, a  date which will live in infamy. On that day, Imperial Japanese bombers  shattered the morning calm at Pearl Harbor, killing Petty Officer Craig  and more than 2,000 of his brothers in arms.  Nearly eight decades later, however, his remains were listed as  unknown and interred at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific  in Honolulu. He was reported as missing in action, but Petty Officer  Craig is missing no more. Thanks to the outstanding work of the Defense  POW/MIA Accounting Agency, his remains were accounted for in 2017, and  just last weekend, on the 78th anniversary of the attack on Pearl  Harbor, he arrived home in Arkansas to his final resting place.  Petty Officer Craig's burial is a long-overdue moment of honor for a  brave sailor. It is also a moment of hope for our many military  families whose loved ones haven't yet been found--a reminder that our  Nation will not rest until every one of our missing heroes is back in  our arms or laid to rest with honor.  We have now fulfilled this solemn pledge to Petty Officer Craig.  Nearly 80 years after his disappearance, we have affirmed once again  that the United States leaves no man behind on the battlefield.  Fentanyl Sanctions Act  Mr. President, synthetic opioids like fentanyl kill tens of thousands  of Americans each year. They are a terrible accelerant that has fueled  the worst drug crisis in our Nation's history, killing more people  every year than died in the entire Vietnam war.  These drugs aren't made here in the United States. No, they are  flooding across our borders from overseas, trafficked by cartels, and,  even unwittingly, sometimes by the U.S. Postal Service.  Synthetic opioids are often produced in superlabs by the drug cartels  that are terrorizing our border communities. But the ingredients for  those drugs--and sometimes the drugs themselves--can be traced back to  a different source: China, whose vast pharmaceutical and chemical  industries frequently have been abused to poison our fellow citizens.  The Chinese Communist Party has been waging an opium war in reverse  against the United States for far too long. As tens of thousands of  Americans have perished from overdoses, Chinese officials have turned a  blind eye to the drug criminals who have profited off of our pain. But  now, desperate for a trade deal to save its sputtering economy, Beijing  has finally promised to crack down on fentanyl and other synthetic  opioids. But we would be naive to trust any promise from Chinese  Communists, especially this one.  It is time that we take matters into our own hands. That is exactly  what we will do in the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, which  includes my bill introduced with Senator Schumer to sanction foreign  drug dealers in China, Mexico, and elsewhere. The bill also urges the  President to work with our allies to impose even tougher multilateral  sanctions against foreign drug dealers. It authorizes new funding for  law enforcement and the intelligence community for counternarcotics  activities. It establishes a commission to find new ways to stop the  flow of drugs from overseas.  This bill will soon be signed by the President and become law. This  is welcome news for law enforcement and for families who are battling  the crisis of opioid addiction, and it is bad news for the Chinese  Communist Party and foreign drug dealers around the world who are  responsible for the poisoning of so many Americans.  Protecting Europe's Energy Security Act of 2019  Mr. President, 70 years after the creation of NATO, the biggest  external threats to the alliance are our revisionist adversaries--China  and Russia. Unfortunately, however, the alliance faces some internal  threats, too, among the allies themselves, who too often fail to take  these adversaries seriously. Instead, they strike dangerous deals with  the very powers that threaten to destroy all of us.  Consider the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project between Germany and  Russia. Germany touts the pipeline's commercial benefits, but Russia  sees it differently--as a strategic tool to divide Europe and thus to  strengthen its fictional claim to dominion over parts of Eastern  Europe.  The Nord Stream 2 pipeline would effectively double the amount of  natural gas Russia could export to Europe along a route that bypasses  the alliance's eastern frontier. This would deepen the NATO members'  reliance on Russian gas while it would enhance Putin's ability to  engage in energy blackmail, just as he has done in the past. For  example, in 2009, Russia shut off the flow of natural gas to Europe  during a dispute with Ukraine, causing energy shortages across the  entire continent in the dead of winter. Putin's opportunities for such  blackmail will only increase if Nord Stream 2 is completed because he  will be able to ship his gas to Western Europe without its transiting  Eastern Europe. Therefore, he will be able to blackmail Eastern Europe  while the Germans will sit warm and toasty in their living rooms-- indifferent to the plight of their NATO allies to the east.  This pipeline is almost complete, so the timeline for action is  short. Thankfully, the National Defense Authorization Act includes our  bill to impose mandatory sanctions on companies that are constructing,  insuring, or financing Vladimir Putin's pipeline to Europe. These  sanctions are a demonstration of our commitment to the strength and  security of the whole NATO alliance.  I urge the German Government and all companies involved in this  dangerous endeavor to pull back before it is too late and to consider  the serious consequences that Nord Stream 2 could have for their  security as well as for the security of the NATO alliance as a whole.  Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps Homeschool  Mr. President, homeschooling parents sacrifice a lot when they make  the legitimate and indeed very admirable choice to personally educate  their children. In effect, these parents are making the choice to go  back to school themselves so that their kids may receive well-rounded  and faithful educations.  Their sacrifices pay off in spades. Homeschooled students  consistently prove to be outstanding citizens because they are taught  the importance of patriotism, faith, hard work, and sacrifice--virtues  exemplified by their parents and their teachers.  Homeschooled students, therefore, ought to be prime candidates for  our Armed Forces for this very reason, but until now, in some places,  it hasn't been clear as to whether homeschooled [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7022"">Page S7022</a>, ] students have been eligible to join their local Junior Reserve  Officers' Training Corps Programs. Now that is going to change.  The 2020 National Defense Authorization Act includes my bill--also  sponsored by Senator Jones--which clarifies that homeschooled students  may indeed enroll in their local JROTC Programs. Our bill will ensure  that the Nation's 2.5 million homeschooled students will have the  opportunity to sharpen and deploy their skills in service of our  country. This will move us closer to being a society that fully accepts  and indeed celebrates homeschooling families for the noble paths they  have chosen.  PCS Act  Mr. President, the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act includes  many valuable reforms. One such reform is the PCS Act, which is  legislation I introduced with Senator Shaheen, that helps military  spouses keep their occupational licenses even when they are on the move  across State lines.  One in three military spouses works in a field that requires one to  have an occupational license, and too many spouses are forced to  recertify every time they move between States. That can be very often.  Most military families move every 2 to 3 years, and when each move  requires an expensive, time-consuming recertification process, many  military spouses might as well kiss their jobs goodbye. These  occupational licenses are a costly burden for military families, who  have already sacrificed so much for our country.  Our PCS Act will alleviate this burden by empowering the Department  of Defense and the States to negotiate interstate compacts for  occupational licenses in fields in which military spouses often work.  These compacts, which are made possible by our bill, will ensure that  military spouses will be able to pursue their careers uninterrupted  even while they are moving their families from State to State and base  to base. Most importantly, the PCS Act will allow military families to  focus on their mission, which is to protect and serve our country with  honor.  I yield the floor.    "
609,Kevin Cramer,0.2896620035171509,R,cramer,cramer," Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, before I begin my comments about an  upcoming nominee, I want to say in response to Senator Kennedy that I  agree 100 percent. Thank you.  Nomination of Daniel Mack Traynor  Mr. President, later today the Senate will have the opportunity to  vote on President Trump's second nomination to the U.S. District Court  for North Dakota. My friend, Dan Traynor, has been nominated and we  will be voting on his confirmation to be district judge for our  district.  I have known Dan for a long time. That is why I was honored to  recommend him to the President and pleased when the President nominated  him earlier this year.  Dan received his bachelor's degree from the University of North  Dakota and his jurist doctorate from the University of North Dakota  School of Law. He clerked for the legendary chief justice of the North  Dakota Supreme Court, Gerald VandeWalle, before heading to Devils Lake,  ND, where he joined his family's law firm and where he works today.  Since that time, he has spent a couple of decades in various  capacities, practicing various types of law, including being the  assistant city attorney for Devils Lake. His extensive criminal and  civil experience both as a prosecutor and defender in State and Federal  courts and also in Tribal court are the main qualifications I think he  brings to this important position. Again, I am honored to support him.  He has tried about 80-plus cases to a verdict or judgment or to a  final decision, which I think is very good experience for somebody who  is then going to stand in judgment. In addition, the ABA gave him a  unanimous ``well qualified'' rating. He has also been recognized since  2015 as a ``super lawyer.'' In 2017 he received Martindale-Hubbell's  ``AV Preeminent Rating.''  So Dan's academic record, experience, and qualifications are more  than adequate to be a good district judge. What makes him an exception  is that Dan and his wife Trish, who is an Air Force veteran, are  raising a beautiful family and are what we call pillars of their  community and our State. As for Dan's family, his mom and dad, Jack and  Jane, I know quite well, and they are what we would call legends in  their community and in our State.  The bottom line is that Dan is eminently qualified in every way,  including possessing the character, demeanor, and temperament, as well  as the intellectual capacity, to be an excellent judge. I look forward  to voting for him, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    "
610,Mike Crapo,0.26507899165153503,R,crapo,crapo," Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator James Risch, Representative Mike Simpson, and Representative Russ Fulcher, I pay tribute to Idahoan Bill Lowry, who was deeply respected among his peers and beyond, having earned a wonderful reputation with hard work and integrity. His wisdom, good will, and stature helped inspire the development of the Owyhee Initiative, which we expect to help secure the future of ranching families and the culture of Owyhee County. The following is Bill's obituary honoring the life of this great American: ``William `Bill' Anson Lowry was born June 6, 1921 to Charles and Sally Lowry joining a sister, Hazel in Bend, Oregon. He was later joined by 3 brothers (Bob, Al, and Richard) and 7 more sisters (Effa, Gladys, Rhonda, Alta, Dorothy, Betty Jean, and Peggy). The family lived in Prineville, Oregon where Bill began school. They moved a couple times but landed back in Prineville where Bill graduated from the 8th grade. After his 8th grade graduation, he began working for the Stearns Cattle Company of Prineville. His Army discharge report listed his civilian occupation as `cowpuncher'. Bill always had a lot of respect for the Stearns family and they became his second family. It was there that he met the love of his life, Vernita `Nita' Hein, who was working in the cookhouse. In 1942 after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Bill was drafted into the United States Army. However, his induction was pushed back because of the flood of boys enlisting. Bill always wanted to honor the boys who quit school and rushed to enlist, describing many of them as being too young to shave. He related his experience and desire to honor these young men to Idaho State Representative Christy Zito at a meeting in Pleasant Valley. Christy then told his story to her friend, Brian Arnold, who composed a poem entitled Too Young to Shave. Through the good work of the Idaho Chapter of Dream Catchers, the poem is now engraved on a marble plaque and displayed in the Warhawk Museum in Nampa, Idaho, fulfilling his dream of honoring these young men. While on leave from his time in the Army Corps of Engineers, he married Nita on July 31, 1945. He was discharged in November of the same year and the young couple returned to Bill's job on the Stearns ranch. The couple began to save their money to realize their dream of owning their own ranch. They worked hard, lived simply, and saved every penny they could even with the addition of their sons, Tim and Mike. Eventually they were able to lease a couple of ranches, later purchasing a ranch in Pleasant Valley, Idaho in 1965. One of Bill's greatest joys in life was working on his ranch and with his Hereford cattle. His love (some would say obsession) for Hereford cattle came from his years of working for the Stearns and with their reputation commercial and registered Hereford cattle. His passions were family, Hereford cattle, thoroughbred saddle horses, conservative politics, education, and unwavering patriotism. Bill is survived by his sons and their families, Tim (Rosa Maria) and Mike (Gaylene); 10 siblings; 5 grandkids--Mirren Lowry, Amaya (Jim) O'Connor, Luke Lowry, Micki (Kevin) Golden, and Melissa (Cody) Bullock; and 9 great- grandchildren. He is preceded in death by his parents, Charles and Sally Lowry; oldest sister, Hazel; and wife, Nita. His family would like to express their deepest appreciation to the staff and residents of Grace Assisted Living in Nampa and the First Choice Hospice caregivers for their kindness to and care of Bill. He was grateful for all of you!'' The poem titled ``Too Young to Shave'' by Brian Arnold that was inspired by Bill and referenced in his obituary follows: ``His body was gnarled and twisted, like a wind-blown juniper tree He'd seen the sunrise and seen the sun set more times than two of me. Hobbling from his truck using two canes, so I stopped and held the door He said, `I'm here for the Town Hall meetin'. Is that what you're here for?' I wondered aloud why a ninety-year-old man even cared about civic affairs He said, `Let me tell you a story.' So I grabbed a couple of chairs. `When Pearl Harbor was bombed a bunch of us boys all went into town to join up From the farms and ranches, and some from in town, we had an enemy to whup. They took down our names and gave us a number, then said they'd give us a call So many young fellers were signing up that they couldn't process them all. Was a whole lot of youngsters standin in line, see they was lyin about their age All ready to die for our country, while still too young to shave. It took a few months before they got to us all, `cause so many wanted to go I was an infantryman in the Army, a regular G.I. Joe. Saw many a good man die over there, it was a special kind of hell We were all just tryin to do our part, for some it didn't work out well. Most are buried in those foreign lands, they never did come home They gave their all for freedom, across the briny foam. That war's long over and there's been some since, but I can never forget True comrades that I fought alongside, as they placed their final bet. So that's why I'm here, just to make sure, that as long as our proud flag waves I do my damndest to honor, those men too young to shave.' '' Bill was a blessing to his family and the community in which he lived, and he will be long-remembered with great affection and respect. We are all saddened by Bill's passing yet grateful for his life and legacy.<bullet> [[<a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7154"">Page S7154</a>]]   "

612,Steve Daines,1.1340919733047485,R,daines,daines," Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week I have the honor of recognizing Charlotte Kinnoman of Lake County for her dedication to Montana's first responders during Christmas. When Charlotte met a law enforcement officer at an event with her family, she learned of the sacrifices our first responders make to protect Montana's families and communities. After that meeting, and at just 12 years old, Charlotte decided she wanted to give back to our first responders. She has been writing 125 Christmas cards a day to give to every first responder she meets. She even has a goal of writing 12,000 total. Charlotte's mom and classmates have also been helpful in writing Christmas cards to make sure they are spreading holiday cheer all across Big Sky Country. I commend Charlotte for her compassion. Charlotte is a great role model for all young Montanans, and I thank her for supporting our first responders this Christmas season.<bullet>   "
613,Tammy Duckworth,1.5297290086746216,D,duckworth,duckworth," Ms. DUCKWORTH. Madam President, I rise today to recognize my  colleague and friend, Senator Johnny Isakson, for a lifetime of service  to our Nation that started with his time as a loadmaster in the Georgia  Air National Guard, to his tenure in the Georgia General Assembly, to  his years of public service in the U.S. House of Representatives and  the U.S. Senate.  With Johnny's retirement, the Senate is losing a truly great leader;  a man of courage, whose dedication to this country has inspired me more  times than I can count; a man of honor, who has worked tirelessly for  the veteran community; and a man of compassion, who I am so grateful to  be able to call a dear friend.  We will never be able to fully thank Johnny for all he has done for  the rest of us, but today, I want to try. Johnny, thank you for being  there for me at Walter Reed when I was a Wounded Warrior, just home  from combat. Thank you for being by my side last spring, a decade and a  half later, on my first trip back to Iraq.  Thank you for always being there when it matters the most, for being  such an incredible advocate for our veterans, for giving the absolute  best birthday and holiday presents, and for showing what it means to  lead a life guided by integrity, a life defined by service.  You have made our Nation stronger and our Union more perfect. You  will be missed every time this Chamber is gaveled into session.    "
614,Richard Durbin,0.6252800226211548,D,durbin,durbin," Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we find ourselves in the usual December  doldrums. We are somewhere between the end of the baseball season and  the beginning of spring training. It is a time to reflect and a time to  dream.  A familiar offseason refrain from many die-hard Chicago Cubs fans is,  ``Wait `til next year'' or ``next season will be different.'' Well,  next season will indeed be different as Cubs fans will not, in the  immortal words of Steve Goodman, be able to ``catch it all on WGN.''  Chicago Cubs baseball is moving to the new Marquee Sports Network. I  want to take a moment to honor WGN's long-standing commitment to  unsurpassed sports coverage and their historic partnership with the  Cubs.  I think it is safe to say that, for the most part, Cubs fans are an  optimistic bunch. We have endured some very tough seasons and the  longest championship drought in Major League Baseball. Of course, in  2016, the Cubs rewarded their fans with a World Series championship,  the first in more than a century. Throughout much of that century, fans  could count on watching their favorite team on ``Chicago's Very Own,''  WGN-TV. In fact, for 72 years, WGN helped spread the thrills of Cubs  baseball through player milestones, including Mr. Cub Ernie Banks'  500th homerun, pennant races, October baseball, and more than a few  lean years.  The Cubs game on April 23, 1948, wasn't a particularly memorable one.  They lost 1-0 to the rival St. Louis Cardinals. History was made not on  the field but in the broadcast booth as WGN-TV aired its first Cubs  game and set in motion the longest baseball-TV relationship in baseball  history. Since then, WGN-TV has aired 7,115 Cubs games, reaching fans  across the country and around the globe.  It was a great risk for the Cubs to start airing all their games on  television. What if people stopped going to games and only watched from  home? After all, WGN-TV made it feel like you were at the game. The  Zoomar lens brought long shots and close-ups into focus as a television  cameraman swung quickly from views of the whole diamond to close-ups of  batting, pitching, and action in the bullpen. But the gamble was worth  it. The Cubs drew 1.2 million fans to Wrigley Field in 1948, despite  losing 90 games that season.  It became a tradition for kids to come home after school to watch the  Cubs on WGN. Hall of famers Ernie Banks, Billy Williams, Ron Santo, [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7195"">Page S7195</a>, ] Fergie Jenkins, Andre Dawson, Ryne Sandberg, and a host of Cubs stars  became household names to fans across the country. Many a big leaguer  today will tell stories about watching the Cubs on WGN-TV and dreaming  of playing at Wrigley Field.  Generations of fans grew up knowing the sights and sounds of WGN-TV's  Jack Brickhouse yelling, ``Hey-hey!'' or Harry Caray's ``Holy cow!''  and his famous rendition of ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game.'' Both of  these hall of famers informed, entertained, and thrilled us for decades  with their play-by-play. They dazzled in the booth even when the action  on the field fell a bit short. WGN legendary producer/director Arne  Harris was behind the scenes from the 1960s through 2001, bringing us  baseball history from Wrigley Field. A distinguished list of announcers  also graced the WGN-TV broadcast booth including Milo Hamilton, Lou  Boudreau, Vince Lloyd, and Lloyd Pettit. Today, Len Kasper and Jim  Deshaies faithfully continue that tradition and are our trusted guides  to Cubs baseball. They will continue, along with WGN-TV director of  production and author Bob Vorwald, on the new network in 2020.  I want to take this opportunity to thank WGN-TV president general  manager Paul Rennie and all the good people at WGN who brought us the  sights and sounds of the Cubs and the Friendly Confines for 72 years.  In addition to those already mentioned, we acknowledge longtime  sports editor Jack Rosenberg, who routinely pulled off the impossible  in support of the telecast; directors Chris Erskine, Jack Jacobson,  Bill Lotzer, Skip Ellison, and Marc Brady; and videographer Joe  Pausback. My friend, Shaun Sheehan, was WGN's ambassador to Washington  and to the Congress for nearly three decades. And countless assistant  directors, technical directors, camera operators, audio engineers,  video shaders, and sales, business, and station executives, including  Jim Tianis, Frank Leone, Mike Aiello, Scott Jones, Steve Casey, Mike  Clay, Mark Stencel, Marty Wilke, Errol Gerber, Marissa Rudman, Jake  Fendley, Mark Boe, Jeff Shaw, Ward Quaal, Joe Loughlin, Dennis  FitzSimons, Peter Walker, John Vitanovec, Tom Ehlmann, Greg Easterly,  Jim Dowdle, Sheldon Cooper, Jim Zerwekh, Bob Ramsey, Tom Boyd, and  Terry ``Whitey'' Pearson truly made Cubs baseball on WGN-TV special.  As Bob Vorwald said just before the final games on WGN, ``We want to  tip our hat to Jack Brickhouse and Harry Caray and all the people that  have announced and the thousands of men and women that have worked on  the games. But, the best way to do that is by having a great telecast.  That's always been our mission, and it's important that we uphold that  to the very end.''  As WGN-TV and all the people who made Chicago Cubs baseball telecasts  possible sign off, let me join the countless fans in thanking them for  creating an American standard of broadcasting excellence.

615,Michael Enzi,0.6424090266227722,R,enzi,enzi," Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory  limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to  those limits. In addition, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to  establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels  consistent with those adjustments.  The Senate will soon consider two measures: the House amendment to  the Senate amendment to ', H.R. 1158, ', the Consolidated Appropriations Act,  2020, and the House amendment to the Senate amendment to ', H.R. 1865, ', the  Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020. These measures contain  spending that qualifies for cap adjustments under current law.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 includes multiple instances  of cap adjustment eligible spending. The measure includes $70,855  million in spending designated as being for overseas contingency  operations, OCO, funding pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of  BBEDCA. This budget authority, all of which falls into the revised  security category, would result in $40,336 million in outlays in fiscal  year 2020. The measure further includes $17,503 million in spending  designated for disaster relief pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(D) of  BBEDCA. This budget authority, all of which falls into the revised  nonsecurity category, would result in $984 million in outlays. The  measure also includes $1,771 million in revised security category  budget authority that is designated as an emergency pursuant to section  251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA. CBO estimates that this budget authority, as  well as other emergency designated changes, would increase net outlays  by $914 million this fiscal year.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, also includes $2,500  million in nonsecurity budget authority that is designated as being for  the periodic U.S. Census pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(G) of BBEDCA.  CBO estimates that this budget authority will result in $1,800 million  in outlays in fiscal year 2020. Earlier this year, I made an adjustment  to accommodate funding in this amount for this purpose and reaffirm  those funds for use for this measure.  The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 also includes  multiple instances of cap adjustment eligible spending. The measure  includes $8,645 million in spending designated as being for OCO funding  pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of BBEDCA. This budget authority,  $645 million of which falls into the revised security category and  $8,000 million falls into the revised nonsecurity category, would  result in $2,327 million in outlays in fiscal year 2020. The measure  includes $1,842 million in spending designated for program integrity  pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(B), section 251(b)(2)(C), and section  251(b)(2)(E) of BBEDCA. This budget authority, all of which falls into  the revised nonsecurity category, would result in $1,481 million in  outlays. The measure also includes $6,764 million in revised  nonsecurity category budget authority that is designated as an  emergency pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA. CBO estimates  that this budget authority, as well as other emergency designated  changes, would increase net outlays by $1,705 million this fiscal year.  The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 also includes  $2,250 million in nonsecurity discretionary budget authority for  wildfire suppression operations pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(F) of  BBEDCA. This budget authority and its associated outlays of $2,250  million qualify for an adjustment under the law. Earlier this year, I  made an adjustment to accommodate funding in this amount for this  purpose and reaffirm those funds for use for this measure. As such, I  am revising the budget authority and outlay allocations to the  Committee on Appropriations by increasing revised nonsecurity budget  authority by $27,880 million, revised security budget authority by  $79,500 million, and general outlays by $47,747 million in fiscal year  2020. Further, I am increasing the budgetary aggregate for fiscal year  2020 by $107,126 million in budget authority and $47,534 million in  outlays.  I ask unanimous consent that this notice and the accompanying tables,  which provide details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows: "

618,Joni Ernst,0.7227510213851929,R,ernst,ernst," Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I am honored to congratulate Waverly's Randy Druvenga on the conclusion of his tenure as Chair of the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies--NAMIC--a member organization of property and casualty insurance companies. Randy has helped lead this organization through its 125th year of existence, including the NAMIC Mutual Insurance Foundation's drive to raise $125,000 for scholarships to help talented young Americans pursue their college degrees toward careers in insurance. It is fitting that Randy led NAMIC during this milestone anniversary as the association was founded by Iowans in 1895. While the Hawkeye State is happy to share Randy with NAMIC, we are most proud of his servant leadership in his home State. Randy has served as the past president of the Mutual Insurance Association of Iowa and is currently president of First Maxfield Mutual Insurance Association, a farm mutual insurance company serving more than 7,900 policyholders in northeast Iowa. He is a constant presence in his community, supporting numerous causes including the Waverly-Shell Rock Community Schools Foundation, and as a former referee and member of the Iowa High School Athletic Association Officials Hall of Fame. I want to again congratulate Randy Druvenga for his leadership. Iowans are famous for their commitment to their communities, and Randy embodies that spirit at home and beyond.   "
619,Dianne Feinstein,1.1146390438079834,D,feinstein,feinstein," Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the resolution that  Senator McSally and I introduced to declare January as ``National One  Health Awareness Month.''  ``One Health'' is a term used by health experts--including those at  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--to focus on the  connections between human, animal, and environmental health.  Our resolution will help raise awareness for the ``One Health''  approach and promote efforts that simultaneously improve the health of  people, animals, plants, and the environment.  By using the One Health approach, global health problems including  antibiotic resistance, infectious disease spread, and sequestered  medical knowledge can be addressed.  Antibiotic resistance is of grave concern for both people and  animals. Public health specialists are working with physicians and  veterinarians to minimize inappropriate antibiotic usage in their  patients.  By 2050, according to the United Kingdom's 2014 Review on  Antimicrobial Resistance, experts expect that more people will die from  antibiotic resistant microbes than die from cancer today. The best way  to solve this growing problem is for specialists across a variety of  disciplines to collaborate to reduce antibiotic use by promoting good  sanitation and developing alternatives for antibiotics.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up to 75  percent of new or emerging infectious diseases in people are spread by  animals. Examples include Ebola, Zika, Rabies, Tuberculosis, and  Plague. By destroying natural animal habitats through deforestation,  natural disasters, and climate change, we are forcing animals and  insects to migrate to new areas, thereby exposing humans to new  diseases.  In 2013, a two-year-old boy was the first victim of the Ebola  epidemic in Western Africa. In his small village, deforestation forced  the bats suspected of carrying the Ebola virus to move closer to  people.  Collaboration between physicians, nurses, physician assistants,  nurse's aids, veterinarians, hygienists, anthropologists,  epidemiologists, community engagement specialists, and military workers  helped end the Ebola epidemic by attacking it from different angles.  This was an example of One Health in action. Today, a similar  collaborative approach is working to end the current Ebola epidemic in  Central Africa.  In the United States, diseases such as Lyme disease, Anaplasma,  Bartonella, and Zika carried by ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes,  respectively, are also spreading to new areas.  In 2015, an 11-year-old Louisiana boy was accidently scratched by a  kitten with fleas. He was misdiagnosed by more than thirty doctors and  he became wheelchairbound. However, a ``One Health'' approach saved his  life. The boy was finally correctly diagnosed with a bacterial disease  acquired by the kitten's scratch once he met with a medical team that  included both a physician and a veterinarian. The veterinarian  understood that fleas can give cats bacteria and the physician  understood that a cat's scratch can transmit the bacteria to humans.  The boy was prescribed the antibiotics he needed, and he can now walk  again.  It is time that everybody understands the importance of One Health.  With diminishing resources in the environment and a growing human  population, now more than ever, fighting problems with a One Health  approach must be encouraged.  Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.    "
620,Dianne Feinstein,1.1146390438079834,D,feinstein,feinstein," Ms. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the  ``California Desert Protection and Recreation Act of 2019.''  This bill represents a decade-long collaborative effort between  conservationists, the off-road vehicle recreational community, State  and local governments, small businesses, and public utilities. Through  this collaborative effort, we have developed a path forward to  sustainably and comprehensively manage California's fragile desert  resources.  Before I continue, I would especially like to thank Senators Lisa  Murkowski and Maria Cantwell, as well as their staff, for all of their  hard work to move this bill forward last Congress. With their  assistance, this legislation passed out of the Senate Energy and  Natural Resources Committee in October 2018 and was included in a  bipartisan public lands package.  Despite the disappointing outcome of last Congress, we have come  farther with this bill than ever before, and I look forward to working  once again with Senator Murkowski, as well as the newly designated  Ranking Member Joe Manchin, to maintain our momentum and pass this bill  as quickly as possible.  I also would like to express my gratitude to Representative Paul Cook  and his staff for their tremendous work and collaboration on this  legislation over the past two years.  The California desert is as special as it is unique. Unlike many  deserts in the world, our desert is abundant with plant and animal  species, many of [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S105"">Page S105</a>, ] which are only found in California. From the iconic Joshua Trees to the  desert tortoise, big horn sheep, and scores of wildflowers, the beauty  of the California desert is unrivaled.  I have heard from thousands of constituents who share a love for the  peace and tranquility of this majestic area, such as young students  from urban areas exposed to the desert for the first time and veterans  returning home from warzones finding much-needed quiet in California's  desert landscapes.  When I first came to Washington twenty-six years ago, Senator Alan  Cranston asked me to assume the mantle and carry on his efforts to  protect the desert by introducing and passing a desert protection bill.  Despite opposition, and even filibuster attempts, the California  Desert Protection Act of 1994 passed and was signed into law by  President Clinton. Since then, we have all watched the unique desert  plants, animals, and surrounding communities flourish, attracting  visitors from around the world.  The 1994 bill permanently protected more than 7.5 million acres of  pristine desert land in national parks and preserves, and I worked  closely with President Obama in 2016 to designate three new desert  National monuments that protected a further 1.8 million acres.  The original Desert Protection Act was a crowning achievement for  desert conservation, establishing 69 new Wilderness areas, creating the  Mojave National Preserve, and converting Death Valley and Joshua Tree  National Monuments into National Parks. All told, we were able to  protect, or increase protections for about 9.6 million acres.  I am proud to have been a part of these achievements for the desert,  and I remain steadfast in my commitment to get this legislation across  the finish line.  As I mentioned earlier, this bill represents the varied interests of  desert stakeholders and balances the many uses of the California  desert. I'll highlight some of what's in the bill now.  The bill designates approximately 375,500 acres of wilderness,  including eight new Bureau of Land Management (BLM) wilderness areas.  It expands Death Valley National Park Wilderness by approximately  88,000 acres and adds 7,141 acres to the San Gorgonio Wilderness within  San Bernardino National Forest.  This bill also expands Joshua Tree National Park by 4,518 acres and  Death Valley National Park by approximately 35,292 acres. The additions  to Joshua Tree National Park include 1,600 acres donated by the Mojave  Desert Land Trust.  The legislation also officially designates six existing Off-Highway  Vehicle Recreation Areas totaling 200,580 acres to provide certainty  that these recreational uses will be protected and maintained in a  manner similar to conservation areas.  Two more additions are the Alabama Hills National Scenic Area in Inyo  County and the Vinagre Wash Special Management Area in Imperial County.  The Alabama Hills National Scenic Area preserves 18,610 acres for  continued recreation and conservation. The Vinagre Wash Special  Management Area covers approximately 81,800 acres of Bureau of Land  Management land to provide for wilderness preservation, vehicular use  on designated routes, and limitations on extractive uses of the land  within the management area.  Lastly, this bill designates 77 miles of Wild and Scenic Rivers.  Desert conservation has never been a partisan issue. Over the years,  legislators have come together across party lines to preserve and  protect California's desert.  Considering our progress and bipartisan efforts last Congress, I am  hopeful this Congress will take this legislation up and move it forward  as quickly as possible.  This bill represents years of collaborative work and the interests of  a wide variety of groups and communities with the shared goal of  protecting and sustainably managing California's desert. This area is a  true national treasure, and I look forward to continuing our work to  protect it for generations to come.  Thank you.    "
621,Deb Fischer,0.8821179866790771,R,fischer,fischer," Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues to honor  my friend, the senior Senator from Georgia. At the end of this year,  Senator Isakson will retire after 20 years of service to the people of  Georgia in Washington.  After protecting our Nation in the Georgia Air National Guard,  graduating from the University of Georgia, and serving as a  representative in his State legislature, the door opened for a son from  Atlanta to run for Congress. Georgia saw in him then what we see in him  now: a principled leader, a skillful communicator, and a man worth  trusting. It is no surprise that the people of Georgia have renewed  their trust in him time and time again. And I know I speak for my  colleagues when I say that we are grateful they did.  After six years representing Georgia's Sixth Congressional District,  the Senate gained a true statesman when he entered in 2005. When I was  preparing for these remarks, I came across one of his Senate reelection  speeches. I thought it was particularly revealing to his character and  how he carries himself in the Senate. He told the crowd that was  cheering him on:  I promise you I am ready . . . I am ready to tackle   whatever problem life brings to us as Americans.  With my feet rooted in conservative principles, my belief   in God the Father Almighty, and my belief in the people of   Georgia.  Mr. President, that is who Senator Isakson is.  No matter the obstacles that came his way, he has always been a  steady hand--strengthened by his enduring faith and deep respect for  his constituents. One of those mountains to climb was working on behalf  of our veterans to improve conditions at the VA and end the backlog  that was building for years. Under his leadership on the Veterans'  Affairs Committee, I was proud to work with him to pass the CHIP-In for  Vets Act into law in 2016. The bill allows local communities to take  the lead on new projects by permitting the VA to accept private  contributions to ensure VA projects are finished both on time and on  budget. His support of this bill meant that Nebraskans have the  opportunity to save millions of dollars when constructing the new Omaha  VA Ambulatory Clinic. A GAO report indicates that our new facility is  now $34 million under budget and 4\\1/2\\ months ahead of schedule. I  know generations of Nebraskans will be grateful for his help in getting  this bill across the finish line.  On a more personal note, one of my fondest memories of Johnny was our  trip to Normandy, France, this year to commemorate the 75th anniversary  of D-Day. As a veteran himself, everyone in this body understood the  abounding respect and gratitude he carried for our Nation's  servicemembers as he led the delegation--the same respect and gratitude  he shows to our veterans everyday as he leads the Senate in providing  resources to meet our veterans' needs.  Mr. President, I think if there is any moment that foreshadowed  Johnny's service to Georgia and our Nation, it was his speech  immediately after being sworn in to the House of Representatives. He  turned to his new colleagues and said, ``I hope, in years to come, I'll  be a respected friend, and one who joined with you to make a difference  in the United States of America.'' What a respected friend he has  become. What a difference he has made. It has been a honorable journey,  and it ends with us confirming that the legacy he has worked hard to  achieve from the very beginning has now come true in the end.  Johnny, you are a great leader, a careful listener, and a gifted  legislator. It has been a privilege to work with you and call you  friend. You have served the State of Georgia and our country well. I  wish you and Diane all the best on this next chapter in your lives.  Godspeed.    "

623,Cory Gardner,1.839766025543213,R,gardner,gardner," Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I would also like to take a moment to  say thanks to the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police. They work  long hours to ensure that Members of the staff and Members themselves  are able to carry out their duties safely. On top of that important  duty, they also protect the public who comes to visit to express their  opinion, to express their right to assemble and free speech in the  Capitol and beyond, not only to tour this beautiful Capitol Building,  but to make sure their thoughts are heard on our Nation's policy  issues.  I know every one of my colleagues will join us in expressing our  gratitude to law enforcement and first responders not only in Colorado,  but across this Nation this holiday season. They will give up time with  their own families to make sure that others are safe.  To all those who defend that thin blue line, thank you, and God  bless. You have my enduring support. May you all have a happy and  blessed holiday season.  I yield the floor.    "
624,Kirsten Gillibrand,0.3387629985809326,D,gillibrand,gillibrand," Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment because, as it is written, it really rewards only companies  that are very wealthy and successful with additional tax credits to do  something they are already doing. By that measure, it will leave most  American workers without basic access to leave.  The other potential idea is about shifting hours and suggesting that  workers have to work overtime to be able to have paid leave. Every  parent in America, every person in America, will have a time when they  have a family crisis--whether it is a dying parent, whether it is a  sick spouse, whether it is a new child--and we are still the only  industrialized country in the world that doesn't have access to  national paid leave. We should be able to come together around this  commonsense solution that Senator Schatz has offered to create at least  the first step to make sure our Federal workers aren't  disproportionately harmed because they can't compete with the private  sector.  I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.    "
625,Lindsey Graham,1.9787240028381348,R,graham,graham," Mr. GRAHAM. Johnny, at some point, this has to be painful for you.  Very few people get together at their own funerals.  What we are trying to say is that we like you. You are a breath of  fresh air in a body that has a hard time agreeing on much. I have known  you since I got into politics. I served in the House with you, and I  have served in the Senate with you. I have traveled the world with you.  I have played golf with you. I have had dinner with you. I have gotten  to know your family.  To sum it up, when it comes to being a U.S. Senator, Johnny Isakson  has become the gold standard.  God bless you.  I yield the floor.    "
626,Chuck Grassley,2.2142789363861084,R,grassley,grassley," Mr. GRASSLEY. I do agree. The IRS got the law correct when it issued  Revenue Ruling 2018-2, and our clarification makes clear that it is our  intent for the IRS interpretation of the law to be controlling for all  claims. This is the basis of the ``no inference'' language in the bill  that states: ``Nothing contained in this subsection or the amendments  made by this subsection shall be construed to create any inference as  to a change in law or guidance in effect prior to enactment of this  subsection.''  I thank the ranking member for engaging in this colloquy to discuss  this important issue and the clarification included in the pending  appropriations bill.    "

630,Josh Hawley,0.9421839714050293,R,hawley,hawley," Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, just two brief points this evening--the  first is that I am proud to join not only as a supporter of this  measure but as original cosponsor, and I want to thank the other  Senators--Senator Rubio, especially Senator Cardin, and Senator Risch-- for their leadership on this issue, but I want to be clear that we are  here today in this Chamber, and what we are doing is possible tonight  because of the bravery and the courage of the protesters in Hong Kong.  Many of them are very young people who are risking their very lives,  taking to the streets, standing for democracy, standing for the  promises that were made to them by Beijing many years ago and fighting  for them now, putting everything on the line. And I just want to say to  those protesters that you are making a difference, that your lives have  made a difference, and to those who even now are trapped inside PolyU  in this siege that the Hong Kong police force has created--this  humanitarian crisis that the Hong Kong police force has fostered--what  you are doing is inspiring the world. What you are doing has moved this  body. What you are doing is changing the world. Thank you for your  courage. Thank you for your bravery. Thank you for believing in your  city, and thank you for believing in Hong Kong.  The other thing I would say is that, while today is a good day in the  struggle to preserve the freedoms of this city and the struggle against  a totalitarian regime in Beijing, it is not the last day. Although this  step is an important step that this Chamber takes, it is not the last  step that this Nation may need to take in order to hold China to its  commitments made in 1984, in order to protect the autonomy and the  liberty of the city of Hong Kong because, make no mistake, we are in  for a long struggle with Communist China. We are in for a long struggle  with Beijing. We know what their ambitions are: to dominate Hong Kong,  to dominate Taiwan, to dominate the region and, ultimately, to impose  their will on the entire international system. We are going to have to  stand against that for freedom, for liberty, for our security and our  prosperity.  So there is much to do. There is a long road ahead of us, but today  is a good day, and I hope the people of Hong Kong will see that the  people of the free world are awake, that they are with you, and we are  ready to stand together.  I yield the floor.    "

632,Mazie Hirono,0.16578400135040283,D,hirono,hirono," Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago today, the State of Hawaii was  in shock as an active shooter took the lives of two workers at Pearl  Harbor Naval Shipyard and wounded a third worker.  Located on Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam, the shipyard is a pillar  of our community. It employs over 6,400 workers who labor every day to  keep our Pacific Fleet ``Fit to Fight.''  Hawaii is a small place where we have deep connections to one  another. Almost everyone in Hawaii either is related to or knows  someone who works on base or in the shipyard. In my State office in  Honolulu, a member of my staff has a son who is an apprentice at the  shipyard and who was there that day. These connections are part of the  reason why the shooting has impacted our State so deeply. Too many  families were waiting that day for news of their loved ones in harm's  way.  The investigation into what happened is ongoing, and there is no easy  explanation for what happened and why.  It is clear that no community in our country is immune from the  tragedy of gun violence. Today, I rise to honor the lives of those we  lost--Roldan A. Agustin and Vincent J. Kapoi, Jr.  Mr. Kapoi and Mr. Agustin were both dedicated Department of Defense-- DOD--civilian shipyard workers and members of the International  Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers Local 121.  Roldan Agustin was 49 years old and lived in Ewa Beach. He was adored  by his family, who describe him as a ``true American patriot'' who  dedicated his career to his country. After serving honorably in the  U.S. Navy, Mr. Agustin also served in the Army National Guard, retiring  as a staff sergeant, having deployed to Afghanistan and Kuwait.  At Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, he served as a DOD civilian employee,  working as a shop planner in nondestructive testing and a metals  inspector.  In paying tribute to their lost loved one, Mr. Agustin's family said  in a statement:  He was a loving son, brother, uncle, and friend to many.   Having grown up in Waipahu, Roldan enjoyed working on cars   with his friends and spending time with his family and adored   his nieces. We will forever remember Roldan to be humble and   honest, and a generous and patient man.  Vincent Kapoi was 30 years old and lived in Honolulu. He grew up in  Waianae and graduated from Kamehameha schools. His father, brother,  sister, and sister-in-law are also civilian employees at the shipyard,  where he served as a metals inspector apprentice. He was dearly loved  by his family, which includes his wife, parents, siblings, aunties,  uncles, grandmother, cousins, and friends.  His wife offered these loving words:  I have been through a lot of tragedy in my life, but   nothing compares to losing the love of your life. I will miss   you truly, and I will always love you Vincent J. Kapoi Jr.  His sister Theona said in a family statement:  He will always be that easy going, fun loving, ``let's do   this'' man that will remain in our hearts. There are so many   unanswered questions. We all have to be honest, it changes   nothing because we can't bring him back. What we must do is   honor his memory, keep him alive in our hearts.  I also want to honor Roger Nakamine, who was wounded in the attack.  Mr. Nakamine was working as a civilian apprentice at the shipyard when  he was wounded.  Upon leaving the hospital about a week after the attack, Mr. Nakamine  said:  My family and I would like to express our gratitude to the   first responders and the expert medical staff at Queen's, as   well as to all the friends and extended `ohana who have been   reaching out to offer their support physically, emotionally   and spiritually. Our deepest condolences go out to the   friends and family of Vincent Kapoi Jr. and Roldan Agustin.  Roldan and Vincent, like thousands of their fellow workers, dedicated  themselves to the shipyard's critically important mission of repairing,  maintaining, and modernizing the U.S. Pacific Fleet in defense of our  country.  In recognition of their service and in keeping with the words of  their families, I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring the  lives of those we lost: Roldan Agustin and Vincent Kapoi, Jr.  This is a photograph that depicts the memorial, which was set up the  day after this tragedy, where friends and family brought lei to honor  their fallen heroes, their loved ones.  I yield the floor.    "
633,John Hoeven,1.268555998802185,R,hoeven,hoeven," Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I would just like to say how much I  appreciate Senator Cramer, the working relationship that we have, not  just here but a working relationship that goes back many, many years.  As you can tell, he speaks very well, but what comes through is not  only his commitment to his family and his faith, but his commitment to  the people of North Dakota and his commitment to the people of this  country.  It doesn't matter what issue he is working on. He takes the time to  listen to everybody, and he is always willing to explain where he is  coming from and why he comes to the conclusion he does. But there is no  question, he loves his faith; he loves his family; he loves his State;  and he loves this country.  Thank you, Madam President.  I yield the floor.

634,Cindy Hyde-Smith,0.11927299946546555,R,hyde-smith,hyde-smith," Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam President, today I rise for the opportunity to  commend Senator Johnny Isakson on his retirement from the U.S. Senate.  I am a relatively new Member to the Senate, but I think we all  remember the first time we ever walked onto the Senate floor. I know I  certainly do because that is the day I met Senator Johnny Isakson.  With both of us being from the South, I knew we would probably have a  lot in common, a similar view on life, and a heart for the South, but  it didn't take me long to learn that Johnny has a universal heart.  I am guilty of the expression, ``Nothing is special until you make it  special.'' Johnny has such a generous gift of making things special. He  has the gift of making everyone around him feel special. His heart and  his attitude sees the best in people and yet goes further to let them  know how much they mean to him.  He exemplifies being a leader, an encourager, and an investor of  people. He is never too busy to ask how you are doing or to ask about  your family. Common courtesy sometimes isn't always that common  anymore, but I assure you it is with Johnny Isakson.  His brilliance is unquestionable. His ability to articulate what is  important to him is just simply amazing. He can deliver a message that  not only expresses his concern but also has answers and solutions based  on his experience and his tremendous wisdom.  He is the gentle calm in a tremendous storm. He has the words of  wisdom when so many are bewildered. He is the guiding light in the  darkest times. He provides the needed laugh in times of tension and the  voice of reason in times of uncertainty. His love is deep, and his  compassion is true.  He knows how to be a friend. He was a born leader and has the ability  to capture opportunities and turn them into successes. My world has  been enhanced and enriched by this wonderful and precious human being.  Johnny learned a long time ago that the joy of living comes in  giving. You know when a person has in his heart that joy, that wasn't  put there by the world.  When I think about the true statesmen I have met in my brief time in  the Senate, I will certainly have ``Georgia on My Mind.''  Thank you.    "
635,James Inhofe,1.2119359970092773,R,inhofe,inhofe," Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, after visiting our southern border  countless times, most recently in August when I toured the Mexican side  of the border with their deployed National Guard units, I know that we  face a dire situation that is only improving because of the aggressive  action taken by President Trump. As he and I both know, more needs to  be done. Securing our border is vital to national security.  In our discussions with the Mexican Government following my recent  trip, they expressed strong support for doing work on their southern  border to stem the tide of illegal immigrants from other nations in  Central America. Accordingly, I am proud to introduce the Mirador- Calakmul Basin Maya Security & Conservation Partnership Act, which will  provide critical resources to the region to supplement the efforts made  by the Government of Mexico to secure its own southern border. These  resources will be critical because increased insecurity and lack of  economic opportunity in this region are drivers of emigration from  Guatemala and Mexico to the United States as local communities face  pressure to participate in deforestation, logging, narcotics  trafficking and other illicit activities. It is in the best interest  for the national security of the United States to support political  stability, reduced migration, reduction of poverty, and enhanced  economic development around the basin in Guatemala and Mexico.  The Mirador Basin features beautiful Mayan ruins with networks of  pyramids, palaces, and ancient cities that many consider to be the  eighth wonder of the world, and I would agree. I used to fly my plane  over the Mirador Basin, and I have seen the magnificent structures with  my own eyes. My legislation will support efforts made by the Department  of the Interior, the Department of State, the Mexican Government the  Guatemalan Government and various universities and research  institutions to secure this region and ensure future generations are  afforded the same opportunity to see these magnificent Mayan ruins.  One of the most important things we can do to secure this region is  support the local communities surrounding the Mirador Basin by  providing economic opportunity and ensuring that this community  receives direct economic benefit. If the members of the local community  are able to find work in the region, it will greatly reduce the  incentive to attempt the arduous journey to illegally immigrate to the  United States.  Mr. President, it is critical that we secure our southern border.  Border security is national security. It is just that simple. There are  many proposals targeting this issue, and I support many of them-- including building the wall. This additional legislation is a targeted  approach, and I thank Senators Udall and Risch for joining me in this  initiative.    "

637,Ron Johnson,1.8327009677886963,R,johnson,johnson," Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to ask the Senate to confirm  Mr. Chad Wolf to be the Under Secretary of the Office of Strategy,  Policy, and Plans at the Department of Homeland Security.  The Under Secretary of the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans  leads an office of over 150 employees with an annual budget of over $37  million to develop and implement DHS policy, long-term goals, and  strategic plans. Chad Wolf has extensive experience in homeland  security policy, starting in 2002 working as the chief of staff helping  to stand up the new Transportation Security Administration after 9/11  and then as the Assistant Administrator for that agency.  He left government and spent over a decade working on homeland  security policy issues as a consultant in the private sector. Mr. Wolf  returned to public service and the Department of Homeland Security in  2017, serving as chief of staff at TSA, chief of staff to the  Secretary, and now as the Assistant Secretary of Strategy, Plans,  Analysis & Risk. Since February of this year, he has been the senior  official performing the duties of the Under Secretary of the Office of  Strategy, Policy, and Plans, the office for which we are now  considering his nomination.  The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  approved his nomination on a bipartisan basis on July 24. As we all  know, the Department has a number of Senate-confirmed leadership  positions vacant. Currently, 7 of the 18 DHS offices requiring Senate  confirmation are vacant. Three of those vacant positions have nominees  that have been languishing on the Senate floor for months after being  approved by my committee with bipartisan support.  Mr. Wolf's nomination has been pending in the Senate for almost 9  months. Troy Edgar, the nominee to be the Department's Chief Financial  Officer, has been pending in the Senate for 8 months, and William  Bryan, the nominee to be Under Secretary for Science and Technology,  has been pending for over 4 months. All three nominees were approved by  my committee with bipartisan support. We are holding a hearing to  consider Mr. Peter Gaynor as the President's nominee to head FEMA this  week.  Dedicated Americans serving at DHS in acting positions are doing  admirable jobs under oftentimes difficult circumstances. I trust that  Chad Wolf will do the same if he is asked to step aside from his role  as Under Secretary to serve temporarily as Acting Secretary upon Kevin  McAleenan's departure.  I fully expect and I call upon the President to nominate a permanent  Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security. When he does, my  committee will consider the nominee expeditiously. We need confirmed  leadership at DHS to help direct the Department as it works to keep  Americans safe.  We need confirmed leadership at DHS to help direct the Department as  it works to keep Americans safe. I am grateful to Chad Wolf for his  willingness to serve in this position, and I encourage my colleagues to  support his confirmation.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    "
638,Ron Johnson,1.8327009677886963,R,johnson,johnson," Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support House  passage of "", S. 1694, "", the ``One Small Step to Protect Human Heritage in  Space Act.''  I want to thank Senator Peters and Senator Cruz for initiating this  legislation in the Senate. I also want to extend my appreciation to  House Science Committee Ranking Member Lucas, and Space and Aeronautics  Subcommittee Chairwoman Horn and Ranking Member Babin for joining me in  cosponsoring the House companion bill. We all share the goal of  protecting human heritage in space, and it is fitting that we are  working together to seek passage of the ``One Small Step'' legislation.  More than 50 years ago, the world watched in awe as Neil Armstrong  and Buzz Aldrin landed on the lunar surface and became the first humans  to set foot on another planetary body. Prior to their successful  landing, NASA implemented a series of tests, including robotic landings  and human in-space test programs in preparation for the Apollo human  landings. The culmination of those precursor efforts resulted in the  safe and successful Apollo 11 lunar landing, a moment that changed the  course of humanity.  Apollo human landing missions explored a total of 6 sites on the  Moon, leaving indicators of human presence, including rover tracks,  footprints, and scientific experiments and spacecraft hardware, among  other lunar landing site artifacts. Those artifacts that remain  imprinted in the lunar dust and on the surface of the Moon are  cultural, historic, scientific, and archeological artifacts. The bill  we are considering today, the ``One Small Step to Protect Human  Heritage in Space Act,'' directs the NASA Administrator to take  important actions toward preserving those artifacts.  The United States led the way in lunar exploration with humans and we  must also lead the way in setting examples and guiding responsible  behaviors in outer space, including behaviors related to our lunar  landing site artifacts. Congress and the American taxpayers made  possible the United States' historic and momentous Apollo lunar  landings by authorizing the program and investing four percent of the  nation's federal spending at the time to successfully carry it out. It  is incumbent upon the House of Representatives to honor these historic  lunar artifacts and to honor America's investment and commitment to  making the Apollo program a success. The direction in the One Small  Step bill will put into law our commitment toward preserving America's  human heritage in space.  Apollo remains an inspiration; it brought the world together during a  period of unique challenges and resulted in long-lasting benefits to  Americans. As we plan and prepare to send Americans into deep space  once again, and as other nations and actors become increasingly capable  of lunar activity, honoring and preserving Apollo's historic and  cultural significance must be prioritized. In doing so, we celebrate  American ingenuity and the awe-inspiring, humanity-changing  achievements of which we are capable.  In closing, I want to also extend my support of "", S. 2472, "", the ``Neil  A. Armstrong Test Facility Act'' to honor an American hero in our space  program. I urge my colleagues to support passage of both "", S. 1694, "", the  ``One Small Step Act'' and "", S. 2472, "", ``the Neil A. Armstrong Test  Facility Act.''  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms. Kendra S. Horn) that the House suspend  the rules and pass the bill, "", S. 1694, "", as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to require  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to add  recommendations and inform other relevant agencies of information  relating to the principle of due regard and the limitation of harmful  interference with Apollo landing site artifacts, and for other  purposes.''.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
639,Ron Johnson,1.8327009677886963,R,johnson,johnson," Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Mr. Speaker, "", H.R. 8235, ' is a bill that will make a meaningful  difference in the accessibility and transparency of an entire branch of  the Federal Government. It vindicates our critical First Amendment  rights and it will establish a level playing field for access to  critical government documents. For those reasons, I urge my colleagues  to support the bill, as amended.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
640,Ron Johnson,1.8327009677886963,R,johnson,johnson," Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for  yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my colleague, Congressman Doug Lamborn.  He is so faithful every year to organize this Special Order series. And  this year, we recognize, as has been mentioned, the 79th anniversary of  National Bible Week.  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to stand with all my Members and friends  today to share our perspectives on why the Bible is so important to us  and to our country. I am often reminded, I think about and reflect  upon, and we quote all the time, the Founders. George Washington, who  was the father of our country, and he famously said, ``Of all the  disposition and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and  morality are indispensable supports.'' They were the foundation of the  very Republic.  And John Adams is our second President. He comes next. He says, ``Our  Constitution is made only for a moral and religious people. It is  wholly inadequate to the government of any other.''  What he meant was that this is essential to who we are as Americans.  Even more fundamental than that, who we are as human beings.  And it was one of my favorite Presidents, Ronald Reagan, who said  that, ``If we ever forget that we are one Nation under God, we will be  a Nation gone under.''  Mr. Speaker, in the very short time I have, I would share one brief  paragraph, a preface to a historic text that I have in my collection.  Some of the guys have this as well. But this is a copy of a New  Testament Bible study that was approved by and published for the public  schools of Dallas, Texas, by its Board of Education in September of  1946.  The preface was written by a gentleman by the name of Henry van Dyke.  And it is a wonderful summary of what the Bible means to us and to the  world. I will read that into the Record.  ``Born in the East and clothed in Oriental form and imagery, the  Bible walks the ways of the world with familiar feet and enters land  after land to find its own everywhere.  ``It has learned to speak in hundreds of languages to the hearts of  men. It comes into the palace to tell the monarch that he is a servant  of the Most High, and into the cottage to assure the peasant that he is  a son of God.  ``Children listen to its stories with wonder and delight, and wise  men ponder them as parables of life. It has a word of peace for the  time of peril, a word of comfort for the time of calamity, a word of  light for the hour of darkness. Its oracles are repeated in the  assembly of the people, and its counsels whispered in the ear of the  lonely.  ``The wicked and the proud tremble at its warnings, but to the  wounded and the penitent, it has a mother's voice. The wilderness and  the solitary place have been made glad by it, and the fire on the  hearth has lit the reading of its well-worn page.  ``It has woven itself into our dearest dreams; so that love,  friendship, sympathy and devotion, memory and hope, put on the  beautiful garments of its treasured speech, breathing of frankincense  and myrrh. No man is poor or desolate who has this treasure for his  own.  ``When the landscape darkens and the trembling pilgrim comes to the  Valley named of the shadow, he is not afraid to enter; he takes the rod  and staff of Scripture in his hand; he says to friend and comrade;  `Goodbye, we shall meet again.' And comforted by that support, he goes  toward the lonely pass as one who walks through darkness and into  light.''  Mr. Speaker, that is a pretty good summary about what the Bible means  to us. I am delighted to honor National Bible Week and to stand with my  friends here.    "
641,Ron Johnson,1.8327009677886963,R,johnson,johnson," Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. Speaker, I think it was Winston  Churchill who said you can always count on Americans to do the right  thing after they have exhausted all other options.  You know, Congress looks that way to me from time to time. This is  not the process or the timeline or the structure I have argued for.  This COVID-19 package doesn't have all the provisions that I have asked  for. It is clearly not a perfect bill.  Yet, it is the targeted and focused relief that our country needs. It  follows the framework that a bipartisan group of eight Senators and  eight House Members, including myself, unveiled a few weeks ago.  We knew then that it was not a perfect bill, but we knew it was the  way forward. I am proud of the role that I have played and that the  Problem Solvers Caucus has played in breaking this gridlock. I am proud  of the role that we have played in making sure that our economy and our  schools can stay open and that our testing and our vaccine deployment  can be ramped up.  Madam Speaker, this has been a messy week, but this is a good day for  America.    "
642,Ron Johnson,1.8327009677886963,R,johnson,johnson," Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I, too, rise today to pay tribute to my good friend and mentor on the  Energy and Commerce Committee, Greg Walden.  I spent 27 years in the United States Air Force. We lived by a code  of conduct every day. We came to work. We embodied those core values of  integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all that we do.  In my experience, it is not often that you find people in private  life or in other sectors of public life who also embody those same core  values, but Chairman Greg Walden does.  Whether he was fighting for healthcare changes for the American  people, to make America more energy independent and secure, whether he  was trying to make sure that Big Tech did not overrun the American  people, [[', Page , H6897, ] you could always count on Greg Walden to be out in front leading, not  following, and, certainly, not leading from behind.  I learned a lot in the 6 years that I served with Greg Walden when  he was on the Energy and Commerce Committee as the chairman, and even  before that as chair of our National Republican Congressional  Committee.  It is with a great deal of sadness that we see him leave because a  lot of core institutional knowledge is going to go out the door. But I  want to say how much I have admired working with Greg Walden.    "
643,Doug Jones,0.28054100275039673,D,jones,jones," Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I want to first thank Senator Inhofe and  Senator Reed and their staff for their amazing work on this National  Defense Authorization Act. What we are about to accomplish is truly  remarkable, not only for America but for individuals and families.  I am rising today as grateful and as humbled as I could ever imagine  being in this Senate Chamber, but I am also just the opposite--I am  excited like a kid at Christmas waiting to have the final passage of  this because it means so much. We are at the finish line, about to run  through the tape in a race, a marathon that so many folks thought we  could never finish. I am talking about this momentous and historic  National Defense Authorization Act upon which we are about to vote and  pass in just a few moments.  The NDAA includes so many of our collective priorities to bolster the  defense of our Nation, to modernize our military, and to take care of  our servicemembers and their families. But included very deep within  this incredibly thick piece of legislation is a provision that has been  repeatedly introduced over the past 18 years, but it has never gotten  across that finish line. I am speaking about the Military Widow's Tax  Elimination Act.  For the past four decades, the military widow's tax has prevented  surviving military spouses from receiving the full benefits they are  owed by the U.S. Government. Legislation to repeal this unfair law has  been repeatedly introduced in Congress for the last 18 years, but money  and budgets and points of order have always won out over the commitment  we have made to these families. [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7068"">Page S7068</a>, ]  When I introduced it with my friend and colleague Senator Collins  earlier this year, we knew it was going to be an uphill battle. We knew  that the fight had been going on for so long and that we faced a steep  climb, but we took a great deal of strength and motivation from the  impacted widows themselves who have fought and advocated for this bill  for nearly two decades. They have been a regular presence on Capitol  Hill, asking year after year for Members of Congress to lend an ear to  their cause. I was heartbroken when one of them told me they felt like  they were easy to brush off because they were ``just a bunch of little  old ladies.''  I was heartbroken when Cathy Milford said every time she came up here  it was like digging up her husband and burying him all over again.  After 18 years without success, yet all the while being told how  supportive Members of Congress are for their service and sacrifice,  time and time again, you could see how disheartening that might be when  they would go home emptyhanded.  So when I told them this was the year--Senator Collins and I had made  it our mission that this was going to be the year we were finally going  to get this done--there were more than a few of them who were  skeptical, but they were, of course, always optimistic.  We knew we had to fight harder than ever before if we were going to  be successful. We had to make our case that this injustice could no  longer stand. As we did, one by one, Senators and Members of the House  joined this cause with us. By summertime, in this body, we had earned  an unprecedented number of Senators' support for this bill.  Today, as we are about to vote, there are over three-fourths of the  U.S. Senate who have cosponsored this legislation. Think of that. In  such a partisan time as we live in right now, in this moment, three- fourths of the U.S. Senate has voiced their support.  Because of the momentum we built, this is the year, this is the day,  we will finally honor the commitment we made to these families who have  given everything to our country. This is the year, this is the day, we  will let our actions speak louder than words, the year we finally put  our money where our mouth is when it comes to honoring our  servicemembers and their families. This is the year, this is the day,  we finally repeal the widow's tax once and for all.  It is, to be candid, difficult to articulate what it means to me to  be able to help bring this legislation across the finish line for these  surviving spouses.  Their strength, their devotion, and their grit have made this all  possible. Their loved ones gave what Abraham Lincoln called ``the last  full measure of devotion'' to our country, and the continued commitment  to that devotion by their surviving spouses is a daily reminder of why  I am here, why we are all here.  In their own way, these widows have also fought to advance the ideals  and values of the Nation we all love so much. Instead of becoming  bitter or jaded when learning of this injustice, these incredible women  worked to make things right. Year after year, they would gather in  Washington to meet with Members of the House and the Senate to beg  Congress to right this wrong, only to be told that as unfair as this  may be, eliminating the widow's tax would just cost us too much. For 18  years, they were told it could never get done, but they never ever gave  up.  It kind of reminds me of a movie that was one of my favorite movies  years ago called ``Network,'' in which the late actor Peter Finch  starred as a somewhat crazed newscaster who was so fed up with the  state of affairs in this country that he implored all those watching to  go to their windows and throw open the windows and just yell: ``I'm mad  as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore,'' and they did.  That is essentially what these widows did as well. Year after year,  they screamed that they were not going to take it anymore, and they  built momentum that led to this historic vote today.  I am so glad this fight is finally coming to an end. I am going to  miss their regular visits and their friendship. I truly hope they know  how much it has meant to me and my staff as well. My staff has been all  in. Everybody has been so dedicated and so passionate about getting  this across the finish line.  I am deeply grateful to Senators Inhofe and Reed, who have been  critical to this effort to get this done. Without them, it would not  have been possible. For their support, I am truly appreciative.  More important, I am especially grateful to my partner in all of  this, Senator Collins, whose deeply held commitment was vital to our  success.  Today we will celebrate the end to our four-decades-old fight. We  will take stock in this great achievement together, but tomorrow we  must turn our attention to the next big issue because there are so many  others who need our help, our attention, and our courage to do the  right thing.  For now--for now we can celebrate because today those military  spouses who had once proclaimed they were mad as hell and not going to  take it are watching this proceeding with a more joyous feeling. These  widows are watching in the quiet of their homes, perhaps in the  Gallery, many of them grasping a photograph of their loved ones, their  late husbands, but they all have tears in their eyes, saying to each  other and to us in this body: Thank you because now I am happy as hell  that I don't have to take it anymore.  I assure my colleagues that right now their spouses, those who gave  the ultimate sacrifice for this country, are watching from that  heavenly perch above, standing at full attention, and saluting the  Members of this Congress and saying: Thank you. Thank you for  recognizing the ultimate sacrifice I made for this country. Thank you  because you have demonstrated a commitment to me and my service, and  with that final commitment from you, the commitment I made to my loved  ones, the commitment to care for them even after I am gone, has finally  been fulfilled, and I can truly rest in peace.  To my colleagues in the Senate, by your vote today, you are doing so  much more than modernizing our military providing for the Nation's  defense. By your vote today, you are returning their salute--the salute  to those brave servicemembers who gave their all in service to this  country.  Folks, this is a really, really big deal, and I salute all the  Members of this body for their efforts.  I yield the floor.    "
644,Tim Kaine,0.423911988735199,D,kaine,kaine," Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Protecting  Critical Services for Mothers and Babies Act, with my colleague Senator  Perdue. Enacting this bill will help ensure that mothers and infants  across the country continue to receive access to important health  programs.  About 700 women die each year in the United States from complications  during or after pregnancy, a problem that disproportionately affects  Black and American Indian/Alaskan Native women. In the face of these  challenges, organizations like March of Dimes provide services that  disseminate health information to pregnant women and mothers and  support care for premature and ill infants.  Inflexible funding rules and historically low interest rates have  combined to result in a sharp increase in March of Dimes' pension  funding obligations next year. This Act will extend more flexible rules  to organizations that have a long track record of serving maternal and  infant health needs. These rules, already offered to other  organizations, will continue to protect plan participants while also  smoothing out pension funding obligations. This change will ensure that  resources are not diverted away from important maternal and infant  health programs.    "
645,John Kennedy,1.8674349784851074,R,kennedy,kennedy," Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say good-bye to this body  as my time serving the Fourth Congressional District of Massachusetts  comes to a close.  This job has been an honor. We have come quite a long way since my  first days in the Capitol when I had an AP reporter following me around  for the day, and I got so lost trying to find the House floor that I  ended up in the Longworth parking garage.  Luckily, things have mostly improved from there:  Seeing my name on that office door for the first time;  Keeping company with giants that I grew up idolizing, like John  Lewis, Eliseo Medina, and Dolores Huerta;  Having the honor of responding to Donald Trump's first State of the  Union from Diman Regional Voc-Tech in mighty Fall River, Massachusetts.  There are a few people who I would not be here without.  To my wife, Lauren: Thank you for serving alongside me, for the  sacrifices that you made and the heart that you gave to this job, too.  Tell Ellie and James that dad has breakfast, bath, and school drop-off  duty for the next 15 years or so.  To the Massachusetts delegation: I loved serving with you. I loved  learning from you. There is no team I would rather have been in the  trenches with every day.  To my constituents back home: I am so grateful for the trust that you  put in me. My proudest moments were when you allowed me to bring your  voice to this Chamber, when I could carry what you felt in Taunton or  Attleboro or Fall River or Milford to this floor. Thank you for the  privilege that you afforded me. I will see you back home soon.  Finally, to the staff members who worked and thought and fought and  talked and wrote and served alongside me over the course of the last 8  years; you all are the heroes behind my story. There will never be  words for my gratitude for everything that you took on every single  day--and so many nights--to ensure that we did this job right. I will  miss not seeing all of your faces quite so often.  Mr. Speaker, I leave this body proud and hopeful because here is what  I know: that we are a complicated and messy country, that we violated  our founding promises before the ink was dry. We boldly declared, ``We  the people,'' and promptly defined ``we'' as rich, White, Protestant  men. We staked out moral high ground of life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness, and paid for it with human bondage, abuse, and suffering  that we carry to this day.  But embedded in that history is a slow and stubborn story that every  generation shares, a journey to heal those wounds, an understanding  fought and bled for over time that we are in this mess together whether  we like it or not.  Our arc isn't clean, but it is clear that each generation expands  that definition of ``we.'' We suffer setbacks. We get pushed off track  and sometimes can't feel that progress. We fight amongst ourselves. But  still, generation after generation, we expand.  And that is the counterweight to the great lie of these times, that  the American pie is finite; that for my family to survive, yours must  suffer; that the richest Nation on Earth is somehow plagued by scarcity  rather than greed.  Loosening that lie's grip on our country is the work of our  generation--for people who feel unseen, unheard, and unrepresented; for  the most in need of assistance and protection, justice and opportunity,  who have been told by their government that there is no room or money  or time or will.  And that injustice is a reality etched in stone rather than a  deliberate choice by those in power about who is worthy and who is not.  I hope that in the months and years ahead, this body can help change  that, that we will err on the side of expansion, of inclusion,  acceptance, equity, and grace, because history makes clear that the  only true error is when we do the absolute opposite.  Our future is big and bright, but it will take everything and  everyone to reach it. I hope that a new generation of Americans will  rise knowing that the people's House stands tall for them.  Mr. Speaker, it has been an honor. God bless and Godspeed.    "

648,Angus King,0.330157995223999,R,king,king," Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, let me thank my colleague from  New York for yielding. Let me also commend Mr. Larson and Mr. Moulton  for their leadership efforts on this, and, of course, Mr. Bilirakis.  It is really a great honor to be supporting this legislation. I have  known, unfortunately, too many people who suffer from ALS.  It is 100 percent fatal. That is the reality of it.  All of us who meet advocates every year coming in to lobby us, or to  urge us to support more research funding for ALS, we realize very  quickly they may be there 1 year and 2 years, and then we never see  them again because they have died. It is a brutal neurodegenerative  neuromuscular disease, and this 5-month limit that was put on them  before they can obtain disability benefits was so unfair.  During that 5 months, the disease can progress so rapidly. The  medical costs go up. The psychological costs are there. By passing this  legislation today, we are going to provide not just financial relief  but also psychological and emotional care and relief for their families  and friends.  In New York, we always refer to this as Lou Gehrig's disease after  the famed Yankee slugger, and I am saying that as a Mets fan. Lou  Gehrig is a hero in New York. Unfortunately, as great as his baseball  record is, he is known most for the disease that ended both his career  and his life.  Let me just say also, this will be my final appearance on the House  floor speaking, the last time I speak on the House floor. I want to say  what a great honor it has been to serve for these past 28 years with  all of the Members. It has been a great privilege for me. One of the  real privileges is being able to support legislation such as this,  which is so needed and so necessary.    "
649,Amy Klobuchar,1.482625961303711,D,klobuchar,klobuchar," Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, today I rise with a heavy heart to honor and pay tribute to three exemplary National Guard Members from my home State of Minnesota. On Thursday, December 5, SGT Kort M. Plantenberg, CW2 James A. Rogers, Jr., and CW2 Charles P. Nord lost their lives when their Black Hawk UH-60 helicopter went down southwest of St. Cloud, MN, during a routine maintenance flight. They had just returned home from the Middle East in May after a 9- month deployment conducting medical evacuations. Once back in Minnesota, they had continued serving our Nation by ensuring that our Forces would be prepared to respond the moment they were needed. After this tragic loss, Governor Walz, a Minnesota National Guardsman for nearly 25 years, remarked that ``we will forever be in the debt of these warriors.'' I couldn't agree more. Today, I would like to honor these brave men for giving what President Lincoln called, ``the last full measure of devotion.'' We are forever grateful for heroes like Sergeant Plantenberg, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Rogers, and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Nord. Some who knew these extraordinary men described Sergeant Plantenberg as ``one of the most professional individuals . . . [who] had unlimited potential.'' Chief Warrant Officer 2 Rogers was said to be a ``calming presence'' who could always make those around him laugh. Chief Warrant Officer 2 Nord was described as ``lighthearted--and kind-hearted.'' Like many who serve this country, these men all had so many gifts, and our Nation is better today because of their service and sacrifice. During this time of unimaginable grief, I would also like to offer my prayers and condolences to the families of these fallen heroes. I hope they take comfort in the fact that their lives weren't lost in vain but in support of their common goal: to serve the Nation they loved. They will be missed, but never forgotten, as their service has inspired us all. So now, it is up to us to preserve their memory and support all of our brave men and women who make such an immense sacrifice to keep our Nation strong. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones and with the entire Minnesota National Guard community, at home and overseas. There is no limit to the respect they have earned, no cap to the honor they are due, and no time when we will not be in their debt. Thank you.<bullet>   "
650,James Lankford,1.1228770017623901,R,lankford,lankford," Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, very shortly, the Senate will vote on  the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to  accompany "", H.R. 1865, ', Further Consolidated Appropriations Act. As part  of this appropriations package. a [[', <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7182"">Page S7182</a>, ] version of my bill, the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of  Terrorism Act of 2019, is included in section 903. This bipartisan bill  seeks to restore U.S. court jurisdiction over the Palestinian  Authority, PA/Palestine Liberation Organization, PLO, while promoting  U.S. foreign policy interests in the Middle East through the resumption  of U.S. security assistance to PA security forces. It is a testament to  the hard work of my Democratic and Republican colleagues in this  Chamber that we are about to take up this important legislation.  In 1992, Congress passed the Anti-Terrorism Act, ATA. This law, as  well as future amending legislation, sought to deter and defeat  international terrorism by giving American citizens who are victims of  terrorism overseas the power to sue perpetrators in U.S. court. I was  privileged to work with the original ATA's author, Senator Grassley, in  drafting the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism  Act of 2019.  What our bill--also sponsored by Senators Duckworth, Coons,  Blumenthal, and Rubio--does is strike a balance between Congress's  desire to provide a path forward for American victims of terror to have  their day in court and the toleration by the Members of this body to  allow the PA/PLO to conduct a very narrow scope of activities on U.S.  soil--such as activities pertaining to official business at the United  Nations, engagements with U.S. officials necessary to our national  interest, and legal expenses related to adjudicating or resolving  claims filed in U.S. courts--without consenting to personal  jurisdiction in civil ATA cases. This delicate balance is supported by  a bipartisan coalition of Members of Congress, the executive branch,  and American victims of international terrorism and their families.  For 25 years, the Federal courts struck this balance by holding that  the PLO's and PA's presence and activities in the United States subject  them to jurisdiction in our courts unless they can demonstrate that  their offices in the United States deal exclusively with the official  business of the United Nations and that their activities in this  country are commensurate with their special diplomatic need for being  present here.  The courts correctly held that the PLO's and PA's fundraising and  public relations activities such as press releases and public  appearances, whether characterized as diplomatic public speaking or  proselytizing, are not essential to their diplomatic functions at the  United Nations Headquarters. The bill codifies the distinction  recognized in these cases while giving the PLO and PA a clear choice.  Unless they limit their presence to official business with the United  Nations and their U.S. activities commensurate with their special  diplomatic need to be in the United States, they will be consenting to  personal jurisdiction in ATA cases.  In this regard, the exception in the language for ``ancillary''  activities is intended to permit only essential support or services  that are absolutely necessary to facilitate the conduct of diplomatic  activities expressly exempted in the bill.  By applying the bill to any case pending on or after August 30, 2016,  we are making clear Congress's intent that courts have the power to  restore jurisdiction in cases previously dismissed for lack of  jurisdiction after years of litigation. It is to be liberally construed  to carry out the purposes of Congress to provide relief for victims of  terrorism, and it specifies Congress's intent to enable victims to  pursue justice without being subjected to repetitive, unnecessary, or  protracted litigation, which would just reopen the pain that many  Americans have already suffered through.  As the Congress finishes its final week of the first session of the  116th Congress, I look forward to voting in favor of this important  legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same.    "

653,Mike Lee,0.7529000043869019,R,lee,lee," Mr. LEE. Madam President, where I come from in Utah, $700 million is  a lot of money. Seven hundred million dollars is something we ought to  worry about where we are going to get it.  It is not unreasonable for us to request that the House of  Representatives agree to the language we unanimously, on a bipartisan  basis, passed out of the Senate Commerce Committee.  In my mind, it is unfortunate that we are allowing the House of  Representatives' unreasonable, unwarranted demand--a demand the  chairman of the Commerce Committee himself acknowledges is one they  shouldn't object to--to rule the day and prevent this legislation from  becoming law.    "
654,Mike Lee,0.7529000043869019,R,lee,lee," Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. Let's give  this lifeline to people. Let's move forward and build on this  downpayment.    "
655,Mike Lee,0.7529000043869019,R,lee,lee," Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the people  of Nevada's Third Congressional District with a plea to all of my  colleagues:  We are now entering the darkest period of this pandemic. Americans  are scared, and I don't blame them. Americans are also angry, and they  should be. They are angry at Congress and this administration for  failing to pass more relief for struggling families, frontline workers,  and small businesses.  Thousands more Nevadans filed for unemployment during the last few  weeks. Over 400,000 Nevadans remain at risk of eviction as housing  assistance expires.  As this virus uncontrollably spreads in every corner of this country,  our frontline workers and hospitals are overwhelmed with a tidal wave  of new COVID-positive patients.  There is no more time for political games that have consumed Congress  for months. There never was. I am pleading to my Republican and  Democratic colleagues, to our leadership, and to this administration:  It is time to do our jobs and pass more COVID-19 relief now.    "
656,Mike Lee,0.7529000043869019,R,lee,lee," Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, it was very close, very close. It is very  difficult coming toward this Mother's Day, but we have to thank them  and honor them for giving us life.    "
657,Mike Lee,0.7529000043869019,R,lee,lee," Mr. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, let me also say how important it  is that we really understand and recognize that this is a global  pandemic and it knows no borders.  This bill will also ramp up testing, contact tracing, and outreach to  ensure that those communities most impacted are supported. It  strengthens outreach to medically underserved communities. Again, Black  and Brown and indigenous people have suffered the most from COVID.  This bill will ensure that the testing and tracing efforts treat  people of color as partners in engaging their communities.  This is a health and economic pandemic of enormous proportions that  we have never experienced in our lifetime. We must make sure that  people have safe places to work and attend school. Their health and  economic needs are addressed in this bill. We cannot have one without  the other.  So let's pass this comprehensive relief. Let's begin to try to heal  our country. Please support this bill, and I ask for an ``aye'' vote.    "

Mr. President, this month we recognize the 100th  anniversary of the founding of the American Meteorological Society,  AMS, which spent the last century advancing the atmospheric and related  sciences. The work of AMS contributed to technologies and services that  expand our understanding of the world and the risks associated with our  water, weather, and climate.  AMS was founded in 1919 in Milton, MA, to advance, promote, and  disseminate information about these important sciences. The society now  has over 13,000 members, including researchers, educators, students,  enthusiasts, broadcasters, and other professionals in weather, water,  and climate. Its rigorously peer-reviewed scientific publications and  scientific conferences have contributed to knowledge growth across the  geosciences, especially in the prediction of environmental phenomena  that has led to lifesaving services. AMS also offers nationally  recognized certifications that serve the public's need to identify  broadcast and consulting meteorologists who have achieved a high level  of competency in communicating complex weather, water, and climate  information.  AMS has been a leader in promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion  in the science, technology, engineering, and math STEM fields. Its  activities in support of STEM education and development activities for  K-12 teachers have positively impacted millions of students nationwide.  Its leadership in education also brings AMS to the Halls of Congress,  where the society supports congressional fellows, research studies on  environmental policy, and policy briefings to ensure that policies are  developed using the best available knowledge and understanding.  AMS has also been crucial in developing the extensive scientific  evidence of manmade climate change and has helped us understand the  threat it poses to society if we do not act. AMS has been an  international leader in providing peer-reviewed information to support  evidence-based decision making related to climate change. Congress owes  a debt of gratitude to AMS for its advocacy and education on this  global threat.  With the scope and size of the challenge that climate change  presents, Congress and the American people will undoubtedly depend on  another successful century of leadership and scientific advancements  from the American Meteorological Society. We congratulate and thank AMS  for its century-long effort to understand the natural world, and we  pledge our continued support to the important sciences AMS aims to  advance.    "

662,Martha McSally,1.4753979444503784,R,mcsally,mcsally," Ms. McSALLY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the importance  of a vote we took earlier on the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2020.  This bill delivers on the needs of the warfighter today and invests  in capabilities we must have for the future.  I also fought for and secured huge wins for the Grand Canyon State.  As home to 10 military installations, Arizona plays a key role in many  missions critical to our Nation's defense. Our bipartisan legislation  highlights the incredible contributions that Arizona bases, citizens,  and industry make to support our military each and every day.  Since I have been in Congress, I led the fight to stop the A-10 from  being mothballed, and this bill continues to secure resources needed to  modernize [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7087"">Page S7087</a>, ] the A-10, based at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.  We also succeeded in funding a new hangar and barracks at Marine  Corps Air Station Yuma and additional F-35s at Luke Air Force Base and  Yuma for training and deploying the next generation of F-35 pilots.  I also secured funding to upgrade the Barry Goldwater training ranges  and many other Arizona initiatives.  The annual defense bill is about protecting the people who protect  us. This year's bill reiterates to the men and women of our military  that we have their backs. It provides the highest pay raise in a decade  and protects military families from greedy contractors who provide  their tenants dangerous and unlivable base housing. These contractors,  who act more like slumlords than landlords, will now be required to  implement a tenant bill of rights.  We also give military families more power in filing disputes and fund  additional housing office personnel to ensure families have advocates  on base.  I am particularly pleased to see 17 of my 18 reforms to combat sexual  assault in the military are also included in this bill. Earlier this  year, I disclosed that I, too, am a survivor of military sexual  assault. After I did, I charged the top leaders at the Pentagon to  immediately identify ways to improve the investigation process and  support to victims.  My provisions increased the number of personnel investigating sexual  assault cases and ensure a victim has access to a special victims'  counsel within 72 hours of reporting an assault. These and my other  improvements share the goal of getting justice for victims sooner.  The greatest disappointment in an otherwise bipartisan bill is the  lack of backfill funding for military construction projects.  After unprecedented obstruction by Democrats on border security  funding, some resources were diverted to border security projects under  authorities legally granted to the President by Congress.  I hear from my constituents all the time in our pro-military and  southern border State: We can and must secure our border and fund our  military. Life is full of difficult choices. This shouldn't be one of  them for any Member on either side of the aisle.  The Senate voted in a landslide, bipartisan way, 86 to 8, to fund  effective military construction projects in this bill--in the Senate  version of this bill. Then, during conference negotiations, Democrats  refused to fully fund these projects due to political games surrounding  border security.  Think about that for a minute. They didn't like the President  diverting the resources to secure our border, so they decided to take  it out on our military by refusing to backfill funding.  Our military deserves better. The American people deserve better.  Nevertheless, one of Arizona's fiscal year 2019 projects at Fort  Huachuca was stalled for unforeseen environmental issues at the  construction site, so it wasn't ready to spend the fiscal year 2019  funds that we approved for it. This funding would have been diverted to  some other purpose in any other year. It could have been funded in  fiscal year 2020, but the Democrats refused to support that. The  earliest the project will be ready to start is next summer.  The Secretary of the Army has assured me that this project will be in  the budget for fiscal year 2021, which starts 9\\1/2\\ months from now,  following the completion of this environmental cleanup. I will continue  to fight for the funding for Fort Huachuca and resolve to work hand-in- hand with the Army until this project is complete.  Finally, I have to note that this is the first NDAA that this body  has passed in decades without Senator John McCain. I think I speak for  Members of the Armed Services Committee and this entire Senate when I  say that we have felt his absence deeply this past year. While he may  not have been physically with us, it still has the fingerprints of his  leadership, grit, and ultimate dedication to servicemembers and  military families.  His memory has propelled us to secure lasting, meaningful reforms for  the men and women who serve, whether in uniform, as a family member, or  in a supporting civilian role.  This is the 59th consecutive annual defense bill that has been  passed. It remains a shining example, for the most part, of what we can  accomplish when we work together to protect Americans and support our  troops.  It was my privilege to bring home these massive wins, working with my  colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, for our troops and for the  great State of Arizona.  I yield the floor.    "
663,Robert Menendez,1.1897350549697876,D,menendez,menendez," Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, we have just passed the Armenian  genocide resolution recognition. It is fitting and appropriate that the  Senate stands on the right side of history in doing so. It commemorates  the truth of the Armenian genocide.  On Monday, we commemorated the International Day of Commemoration and  Dignity of the victims of the crime of genocide and of the prevention  of this crime. The UN General Assembly established this day of  remembrance to commemorate and honor the victims of genocide and  highlight efforts to combat and prevent genocide. Passing this  resolution is a fitting tribute to this day of remembrance.  I have come to the floor on various occasions to talk about the  history of the Armenian genocide. An Armenian priest, Krikoris  Balakian, recorded some of the massacres against the Armenians. He  said:  In Ankara and its surroundings, only a couple hundred miles   east of Constantinople, the killing was done with ``axes,   cleavers, shovels, and pitchforks.'' It was like a   slaughterhouse; Armenians were hacked to pieces . . . infants   were dashed on rocks before the eyes of their mothers.  It was indescribable horror. Even when Armenians were supposedly  deported, the conditions they were forced to live in made clear that  Turkey's ultimate goal was to eliminate the Armenian people.  A visitor to one Turkish city in October of 1915 wrote: ``The 16,000  deported Armenians who were living in the tents have been sent to Konia  in cattle trucks. At night, while thousands of these unfortunate  people, without food or shelter, shiver with cold, those brutes who are  supposed to be their guardians attack them with clubs. And push them  towards the station. Women, children, and old men are packed together  in the trucks. The men have to climb on to the top of the trucks, in  spite of the dreadful cold. Their cries are heart-breaking, but all is  in vain. Hunger, cold, and fatigue, together with the Government's  deeds of violence, will soon achieve the extermination of the last  remnant of the Armenian people.''  Henry Morgenthau, the U.S. Ambassador for Turkey, from 1913 to 1916,  understood full well what was transpiring. He left his post in early  1916 because, as he later recalled, ``My failure to stop the  destruction of the Armenians had made Turkey for me a place of  horror.''  American diplomats like Henry Morgenthau were on the ground in  Turkey, and they made heroic efforts to help the Armenian people, but  here in Washington at the time, no one did anything in the face of this  heinous crime.  As former UN Ambassador Samantha Power wrote in her Pulitzer Prize- winning book, ``A Problem from Hell,'' ``America's nonresponse to the  Turkish horrors established patterns that would be repeated.''  As my colleague from Texas, my cosponsor who has been such a stalwart  advocate with me, has very often noted, this is the first genocide to  be recorded in this century. We know all too well the horrors in the  20th century with the Holocaust and other genocides around the world.  So here in the Senate today, we break those patterns. We join the House  and voted to do so by passing a resolution affirming the facts of the  genocide, 405 to 11. Today, the Senate shows the same resolve.  I am deeply grateful to Senator Cruz for his stalwart leadership on  this issue and to the 27 other Senators from both parties who have  cosponsored the resolution and demonstrated their commitment to the  truth, and the truth finally will set us free.  I am thankful that this resolution has passed in a time in which  there are still survivors of the genocide. We will be able to see that  the Senate acknowledges what they left.  Madam President, I yield the floor.    "
664,Jeff Merkley,2.418256998062134,D,merkley,merkley," Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I wish to state for the record that  although an important engagement in Oregon kept me from being present  in the Capitol to participate in the cloture vote on this year's  National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, I would have voted nay had I  been present.  I am pleased that the NDAA would phase out the reduction of survivor  benefit plan annuities to ensure that the families of our fallen  servicemembers receive the Federal support they need and deserve; would  guarantee 12 weeks of paid family leave for Federal employees; fence  funds for the introduction of new Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces,  INF; limit nuclear cooperation agreements under section 123 of the U.S.  Atomic Energy Act with countries that lack safeguards; and support the  legally-binding and verifiable limits of the New START Treaty as being  in the national security interest of the United States. However, other  aspects of the bill are cause for serious concern, outweighing these  strong points, and must not be overlooked.  I am deeply concerned by this legislation's failure to prohibit funds  for unauthorized war with Iran. There is no doubt that war with Iran  would be a reckless, disastrous mistake. Yet the President has made a  number of impulsive, provocative public statements that risk escalating  tensions. Congress must protect its authority to declare war, and that  means no blank checks to the administration for an unauthorized war  with Iran.  It is also unthinkable that the final NDAA does not prohibit funds  for intelligence support to the Saudi-led coalition in a war that has  caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Communities have  crumbled as a result of this conflict, and an acute cholera outbreak  and famine have killed more than 85,000 children under the age of 5.  The United States has no place supporting, prolonging, or being  complicit in this war's widespread civilian casualties.  In addition, I am concerned that the NDAA does not prohibit funds for  the deployment of a low-yield warhead on a submarine-launched ballistic  missile. The use of this powerful and aggressive tool could drastically  increase the risk of instigating a destabilizing nuclear arms race. [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7090"">Page S7090</a>, ]  Here at home, the final NDAA conference report removed provisions to  address PFAS water contamination. More than 16 million Americans  currently drink water contaminated with PFAS chemicals, which can  affect every major organ in the human body and put humans at higher  risk of a wide variety of health conditions and complications including  liver and kidney damage and thyroid disease. The decision to reject  remedies to this urgent public health issue in the NDAA is deeply  disturbing and completely unacceptable.  Finally, this NDAA does not include adequate safeguards to ensure  accountability for wasteful defense spending. At a time when America  far outspends every other nation in the world militarily, while working  families are grappling with stagnant wages and rising costs of living,  it could not be more important that the Pentagon and its contractors  are accountable to American taxpayers. We should be doing far more to  scrutinize defense spending and to evaluate whether we could maintain a  strong military while redirecting badly needed funding to the American  people's priorities on health care, housing, education, and  infrastructure.  Mr. President, I wish to state once again that I would have voted nay  had I been present. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues  to resolve these critical issues in future bills and to advance the  health, safety, and well-being of all Americans.    "
665,Jerry Moran,2.0140790939331055,R,moran,moran," Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    "
666,Lisa Murkowski,2.5613160133361816,R,murkowski,murkowski," Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a long-time  Senate staffer who recently retired, Nathan Bergerbest.  Many Members and staff who have worked on judiciary, military and  veterans, homeland security, public safety, foreign relations,  intelligence, or Native American issues and national and international  disasters likely had the opportunity to work with Nathan during the 16  years he served the people of Alaska and the Nation. I am sure that  many can share stories of the help Nathan offered, ideas he pushed to  fruition, and wise counsel he provided. My statement today will offer  just a slice of the many contributions this accomplished man has made  in the lives of so many.  Nathan began his interest in good public policy and politics at a  young age growing up in New York City. I believe he once said that he  got involved in his first political campaign in elementary school  because he was searching for the candidate who could improve his  neighborhood. His quest for what was right, what was fair, and what was  useful public policy has never subsided.  An attorney, Nathan has been a litigator, represented an Alaska  Native regional corporation, and worked at FEMA. He started in my  office in 2003 as legislative assistant and retired as senior counsel  and deputy chief of staff. Throughout his service here in the Senate,  Nathan was the quintessential Senate staffer--working late, knowing his  subject cold, understanding the ways of the Senate and navigating them  brilliantly.  His portfolio was huge, complex, and important. Yet he never shirked  from pitching in where he could be useful. Nathan served not only as a  mentor to young staffers in my office but as the conscience of Federal  agency employees, military personnel, and elected leaders--constantly  challenging us to do better, to be better versions of ourselves.  While a tribute from a former employer is always gratifying, Nathan  made a lasting impression on so many who have worked here in the Senate  over the years. I would like to share some of their stories. Several of  the military fellows who have served in my office and worked closely  with Nathan shared these words:  Nathan was part of the original group that came to be known   as the Fairbanks Tiger Team, leading the red-shirted charge   with the Fairbanks community against the Air Force's proposed   plan to remove the F-16 Aggressor Squadron from Eielson Air   Force Base. He rallied community leaders, helped leverage the   effort on the Defense Appropriations Committee, and   ultimately helped the Alaska delegation save Eielson. Then,   only a year later, he worked to support the Alaska   delegation's strong push to bring the F-35 to Eielson. In   just over a year, the delegation was able to take Eielson   from a near-shuttered installation, to one that will soon   have the most capable fighter aircraft in the world, with   significant infrastructure investment to support it.  The Tiger Team still meets over telephone or in person   every other Friday to discuss housing and other local   community issues related to the military. The team has   evolved over the years with new members joining and old   members retiring or moving to different lines of work. Nathan   will be missed on these calls but his legacy will be forever   forged in the Fairbanks community and the national defense of   our country.  New commanders coming to Washington, DC, for their Hill visits would  often ask my military and veterans affairs liaison in Anchorage for  advice about how to prepare. The advice they received was ``Don't try  to BS Nathan, because he'll be able to sniff it out.'' Several of these  commanders were relieved when the meeting with Nathan was over.  But Nathan would bend over backwards to help the military or a  servicemember. ``A Colonel who served in Alaska attributed Nathan for  saving his career. He didn't give any details. Only that he owed him  everything.'' That is just like Nathan--to do good for an American and  move on to the next task.  Nathan was a true friend to the Alaska National Guard as   well, very close to the Adjutant Generals, and always quick   to help support their needs or tout their accomplishments.  Nathan was extremely proud that Alaska boasts the highest   rate of veterans per capita and worked to ensure strong   representation of the Total Force military and veteran   communities, always working to advance veterans' rights and   benefits. His efforts helped lead to improvements in VA   hospitals in Alaska as well as advances in telemedicine and   other support to veterans in remote Alaskan communities.  Public safety and support for law enforcement were always priorities  for Nathan. He helped to lead collaborative efforts among the Federal  agencies and State and local law enforcement to keep drugs out of  Alaskan communities, and he never missed honoring the fallen at the  National Fallen Officers Memorial ceremonies. He cared deeply for all  those who put themselves in harm's way.  While he was a policy expert in so many areas, Nathan was never one  to ignore a plea for help from an individual Alaskan. There are  countless examples of ``casework'' that he took on in addition to his  legislative duties. From arranging military honors for veterans'  funerals, persuading the Canadian Border Security Agency to reinstate  24-hour border crossings between Hyder, AK, and British Columbia,  ensuring Alaskans' concerns were heard by the Navy prior to Northern  Edge exercises, protecting National Guard members from retaliation  during an investigation of sexual misconduct complaints, improving the  standard of care at VA medical facilities, or any number of efforts,  Nathan started with the question ``What does the individual need?'' and  went about getting it done. In many instances, Nathan would help my  staff in Alaska navigate the bureaucracy to help solve an Alaskan's  problem.  A former attorney for FEMA, Nathan was also the Alaska delegation's  go-to staffer whenever disaster struck. After the November 2018  earthquake struck Anchorage, Mat-Su, and the Kenai Peninsula, Nathan  helped disentangle municipalities, school districts, business owners,  and individuals from the byzantine red tape that often characterizes  FEMA. In call after call, Nathan translated FEMA's language and  policies for Alaskans and worked with FEMA officials to do a better job  assessing and responding to the damage. When FEMA sought to respond to  a flood in Galena but lacked a sense of the challenges of rural Alaska,  Nathan helped prod and guide the agency in improving the response.  Nathan took the same sense of dedication to his work on Indian,  Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian issues. Leading Alaska tribal rights  attorney Lloyd Miller called Nathan ``one of the most knowledgeable and  talented lawyers to ever work on the Hill. He combined an unmatched  mastery of Alaska Native legal history with a deep sensitivity to  Alaska Native issues gained from working inside one of the major Alaska  Native regional corporations. And while his background before coming to  the Hill was predominantly with Alaska Native corporations, he was  equally knowledgeable about the unique challenges confronting Alaska  Native Tribes, and the importance of supporting the critical role that  Alaska Tribes play alongside their corporations. Nathan's remarkable  intellect and sage advice will be deeply missed.''  Over the years, as protestors filled the halls of Capitol Hill and  individual offices, Nathan would stay late to talk with those who  visited my office. He would sit with them for long periods and talk  about how they can best navigate the issues, and how they, as  advocates, could best approach offices for meetings and how they can  present their issues in such a way that they were truly being heard on  both sides of the aisle. On at least one or two occasions, I have seen  him go and literally sit on the floor with protestors outside of my  office for an hour or two--just listening to what they had to say so  that he could ensure I understood the concerns of Americans who are so  passionate about the important issues of the day.  No matter what the time of day or day of the week, Nathan made  himself available to me, to other members of my staff, and to Alaskans.  As my constituent services director in Anchorage put it, ``I remember  one time in particular in 2011 where he and I each took 12-hour shifts  around the clock so we could help Alaskan constituents after the 9.0  magnitude earthquake struck in the Pacific Ocean off the northeast  coast of Japan. A massive tsunami was triggered that flooded Japan's  coastal [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7203"">Page S7203</a>, ] communities and damaged infrastructure. We spent several days in  communication with constituents stranded in Japan that were trying to  navigate the treacherous environment, communicate with the State  Department, and ultimately obtain transportation home. He was also  helpful in working with stranded Alaskan constituents after the 2015  severe earthquake in Nepal. He reached out to the lobbyist for Orbitz,  since many of the foreign air carriers on their website raised prices  drastically when trying to book flights out of Nepal after the  earthquake.''  There are so many stories illustrative of Nathan's positive influence  here in the U.S. Senate and in Alaska.  I thank Nathan Bergerbest for his service to Alaska and the Nation  and wish him well.    "

669,Christopher Murphy,0.25918298959732056,D,murphy,murphy," Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am on the floor briefly today to remind  my colleagues to remind their constituents that December 15 is the open  enrollment deadline for healthcare at healthcare.gov. This is  incredibly important because if you are uninsured or you are currently  on an Affordable Care Act plan, if you don't renew or sign up by the  15th, you will be frozen out of the marketplace unless you have what is  called a qualifying event.  As we head back for the weekend, I want to ensure we do everything we  can to make sure there are aren't more people who go into the New Year  without insurance than absolutely necessary. This is especially  important because we have seen a big decline in the number of people  who have insurance in this country since President Trump took office.  Obviously, we made enormous progress after the passage of the  Affordable Care Act. We were able to get the percentage of Americans  without insurance down to around 5 percent. That is really  extraordinary. Yet we have seen that progress reverse. We have seen  more and more people go without insurance since this administration  started to wage what is a pretty consistent, remarkable war on the  Affordable Care Act.  As we speak today, the Trump administration is in court trying to get  the court system--the Federal court system--to strike down the entirety  of the Affordable Care Act. If they are successful in that endeavor,  then next year's deadline will not matter because the Affordable Care  Act will be gone; 20 million people will lose their health insurance;  insurers will once again be able to charge you more because you have a  preexisting condition or your kid has cancer or you are a woman.  As we fight that court case, we need to remember that the Affordable  Care Act is still out there and is still very affordable for millions  and millions of Americans. Seventy percent of enrollees who go on to  healthcare.gov find they qualify for financial help, meaning the  sticker price is not actually what you pay. The tax credits in  ObamaCare will help you get that premium lower.  In fact, on average, folks are getting pretty sizable premiums--in  the neighborhood of $500. That could make healthcare incredibly  affordable, even if the sticker price looks out of your range.  A woman in Hartford, named Deborah, visited a local enrollment fair  after receiving a letter saying her premiums actually might be going  up. She said this:  That scared me a little bit so I wanted to come in and have   someone explain it to me whether it was going to go up,   decrease, you know, what were my options. What ended up   happening is that actually my premium went down for the same   plan but I also learned that just because they renew you that   I had the opportunity to go in and say no, I don't want that   plan, I want to choose this plan. I am ecstatic with my new   plan. . . . I got educated on the insurance process and I   like that.  You can still get that help. You can still get somebody on the phone  to walk you through your choices. I really encourage people to do that  by this Sunday.  For folks who do find an affordable plan, I hope you will also step  up and try to help us maintain the protections and the coverages we  have. We have been fighting a battle with the Trump administration. It  doesn't like the Affordable Care Act simply because the President's  name is on it, despite the fact that Americans don't want the  Affordable Care Act repealed. But the administration has been doing  everything within its power to try to make it harder for people to sign  up. The administration has rolled back the advertising for the  Affordable Care Act.  This is what qualifies for advertising today--charts on the floor of  the U.S. Senate. The administration has rolled back the money for the  navigators--the people who help you pick which plan is right for you.  The administration, for a period of time, threatened to stop paying  insurance companies, which chilled the interest of insurers to actually  offer plans on these exchanges. As I mentioned, the administration is  going to court to try to unroll and unwind the entirety of the act  through a court case.  Lastly, though, what you will find, if you go and enroll in some  States, are plans that look like an Affordable Care Act plan on these  websites but actually aren't. They are what we call junk plans, short- term plans--plans that don't really cover anything. They might not  cover maternity care or addiction care or mental health or prescription  drugs. Some of these junk plans don't cover you if you get admitted  into the hospital on a Friday or Saturday.  Be careful of those plans because the sticker price is going to look  really low, but that is for a reason. It is because they don't cover  anything.  The President has allowed for those junk plans to be shown right next  to [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7015"">Page S7015</a>, ] the Affordable Care Act plan. Make sure you are signing up for a  regulated, Affordable Care Act plan. That is a plan that is bronze or  silver or gold, not one of these junk short-term plans that is not  going to be right for the vast majority of Americans.  It is not too late. Sunday is the deadline. If you are in  Connecticut, make sure to go to Access Health CT or your State  exchange, if your State runs an exchange. If not, you can get  healthcare through ', <a &#x27;="""" href=""'http://www.healthcare.gov."">www.healthcare.gov. </a>, "" I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    "
670,Christopher Murphy,0.25918298959732056,D,murphy,murphy," Mrs. MURPHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Butch Lewis Act.  Passage of this bill is vital to millions of Americans who have  worked hard and played by the rules. That includes tens of thousands of  workers and retirees who live in Florida and hundreds of workers and  retirees who reside in my Orlando area district.  I want to highlight section 4(h) of the bill, which was added at my  request between committee markup and floor consideration. This  provision requires the Pension Rehabilitation Administration to provide  an annual report to Congress on pension plans that have received a loan  under this bill and that are at risk of failing to repay interest or  principal on that loan. Such a failure would require Federal taxpayers  to absorb the cost of the loan.  This provision to increase congressional oversight will maximize the  number of plans that repay their loans and minimize the financial  burden on Federal taxpayers.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Neal for working with me to  make this important change, and I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.    "
671,Christopher Murphy,0.25918298959732056,D,murphy,murphy," Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to  address the crippling cost of student debt.  Although my Democratic colleagues and I agree substantially on the  issue, we disagree substantially on the solution. We need to cure the  disease, not just put a Band-Aid on it.  Absolving student debt or making college free altogether does not  address [[', Page , H7060, ] the problem. It just passes the debt on to people who have responsibly  paid off their student loans, while encouraging the reckless spending  on administrative bloat in higher education.  From 1988 to 2018, the average tuition and fees at public 4-year  institutions tripled and more than doubled at private 4-year  institutions. We have seen an explosion of vice presidents, counselors,  diversity coaches, and all types of administrative staff who have  nothing to do with giving their students a means of finding employment.  Why? Because they can. The money flows freely from the Federal  Government, and they know that--all at the expense of the student.  So rather than climbing walls, lazy rivers, and so-called safe spaces  and then asking for bailouts, universities should be cutting costs and  focusing on educating their students. This frivolous spending has  ruined many young people's futures, and that is how we address the  calamity of student debt.    "
672,Christopher Murphy,0.25918298959732056,D,murphy,murphy," Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the political  status of Puerto Rico, which is home to more than three million  American citizens.  In my home State of Florida, there are now 1.2 million people who  were born in Puerto Rico or who have Puerto Rican roots. That is more  than any other State.  Every month, many Puerto Ricans move to Florida and other States in  search of a brighter future. The island has been through so much--from  the economic crisis, to Hurricane Maria, to the earthquakes, to COVID- 19.  In Florida, we will always welcome these families with open arms, but  I want them to have more opportunities in Puerto Rico. I don't want  them to feel like they have no alternative but to leave their beloved  home.  In my Orlando district, most of my Puerto Rican constituents have  family members and friends still living on the island. Because they  care deeply about Puerto Rico, I care deeply about Puerto Rico.  But every Member of Congress should care about Puerto Rico because  Puerto Ricans are our fellow American citizens. We are part of the same  American family, even though the hard truth is that the United States  hasn't always treated Puerto Rico very well.  Our country now has the chance to do right by Puerto Rico.  That is because on November 3, Puerto Rico held a vote on its  political status. In a referendum, the people of Puerto Rico were asked  the following question: ``Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately  into the Union as a State?'' Yes or no?  Even though Puerto Rico has been a U.S. territory since 1898, and the  island residents have been American citizens since 1917, this was the  first time the people of Puerto Rico were asked this simple and direct  question.  According to the results, over 52 percent of voters, more than  623,000 people, answered ``yes,'' while nearly 48 percent of voters  answered ``no.''  The vote was fair, and the results were clear.  At this point, it is beyond dispute that a majority of the American  citizens living in Puerto Rico want the territory to become a State.  Now, are there people in Puerto Rico who would prefer for the island  to remain a territory or to become a sovereign nation? Absolutely. And  that is completely valid and legitimate.  But when it comes to the political destiny of a place, the views of  the minority cannot trump or take precedence over the views of the  majority. That would turn the concept of democracy on its head. Votes  matter.  And now that the people of Puerto Rico have spoken, the Federal  Government must listen. Whether it is the White House or Congress,  whether it is Democrats or Republicans, we must respect and respond to  this result.  To do otherwise would be immoral or undemocratic, beneath the dignity  of our great Nation.  Let me be crystal clear on two points so there is no  misunderstanding.  First, it is well known that I personally support statehood because I  think it will provide the people of Puerto Rico with democracy and  equality and political power and a better quality of life. They do not  have these things right now and they deserve to have them.  By the way, I am an immigrant and a refugee. I grew up in Virginia  speaking Vietnamese with my parents. One of the main reasons I love  America is because it is a mix of people from different cultures with  different traditions who speak different languages. I reject the notion  that statehood would weaken Puerto Rico's beautiful culture or its  proud traditions or affect the island's use of the Spanish language.  Having said all this, even though I personally favor statehood, it is  not my place to substitute my views for the views of the people of  Puerto Rico.  If they wished to remain a territory or become a nation, I would  honor that wish.  However, the majority of voters have chosen statehood, and so I  intend to respect that choice.  Finally, let me say this: I am a Democrat, but my support for  statehood has nothing to do with any prediction about whether Puerto  Rico would be a blue State or a red State. History teaches us that such  predictions tend to be wrong, and I personally think Puerto Rico would  be a swing State that elects both Democrats and Republicans.  However, I would support statehood for Puerto Rico if it were as  Republican as Wyoming or as Democratic as Vermont. To oppose statehood  because you fear the people will not vote the way you want them to vote  violates the most basic principles of justice and democracy, and I have  zero patience for that.  In the coming weeks, I will work with Puerto Rico's governor-elect,  resident commissioner, and legislative assembly, with the incoming  Biden administration, and with my congressional colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to determine the best path forward.  I cannot promise a particular result, but I can promise I will never  stop fighting for equality for the American citizens of Puerto Rico.    "
673,Patty Murray,0.3611859977245331,D,murray,murray," Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    "
674,Rand Paul,0.6131629943847656,R,paul,paul," Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, we have before us today the National Defense  Authorization Act to authorize the programs and policies of the  Department of Defense. We will be taking a vote to finalize this bill  shortly.  Our national defense is incredibly important. It is mandated in the  Constitution. Our national defense is arguably Congress's primary  constitutional responsibility.  I have great respect and honor for those in uniform who serve. In  fact, I recently introduced a bill to give each soldier who served in  the War on Terror a $2,500 bonus and, at the same time, officially end  the war in Afghanistan. Ending the Afghan war would save us about $50  billion a year.  Unfortunately, the bill before us does not end any of our multitude  of wars. The bill before us simply continues the status quo and throws  more money around the world at conflicts we can't even begin to fathom.  Before rubberstamping more money, it is worth a moment for us to take  a step back and consider two things. First, we need to ask ourselves  whether borrowing millions of dollars year after year to fuel our  appetite for more military spending is a wise policy in the years  ahead.  Second, we need to look at how this bill has been loaded up to carry  things only somewhat related or not related at all to national defense.  As I have reminded my colleagues often, Admiral Mullen, the former  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the national debt was  our greatest national security threat. His exact wording was ``the most  significant threat to our national security is our debt.'' That was in  2010.  When he made that remark, our debt was only $13 trillion. Our debt is  now over $23 trillion. We just keep borrowing and borrowing, and there  is no end in sight.  Under the new budget deal passed by Republicans and Democrats, we are  borrowing $2.75 billion every day. In fact, we are borrowing nearly $2  million every minute.  We spend more on our military than the next seven largest militaries  combined. Our Defense Department is so large that it took them a decade  to even figure out how to audit themselves. Then they said that the  audit itself would cost over half a billion dollars. But then, last  year, they arrived back at square one. After all that effort, they  said: Well, we just can't figure it out. It is too big. We can't audit  the Army, the Navy, the Marines, or the Air Force.  We spend so much money that the Department of Defense literally can't  keep track of all of it. We don't have a great idea of exactly how much  we are wasting because no one can get a grip on how much is being  spent.  A few years ago, the Defense Business Board, which is a defense  advisory panel of corporate executives who report to the Secretary of  Defense, recommended that the Department of Defense can save $125  billion in administrative expenses.  According to news accounts, that report scared everyone at the  Pentagon, so they buried the report. They even tried to keep it away  from Congress for fear that Congress might actually do something with  it, although I wouldn't be holding my breath or too worried. I am not  familiar with Congress ever cutting anything.  We are set to spend $738 billion on the military this year. That is  up $22 billion from last year. Over the past 6 years, military spending  has risen over $120 billion. We say that we are for accountability,  efficiency, and savings. Yet we keep piling good money after bad. How  can we demand better accounting and efficiency when we budget increases  every year?  To be clear, I support our national defense. Supporting our  servicemembers is a worthy cause. There are things in this bill that I  do support. I am a cosponsor of the bill to eliminate the so-called  widow's tax, and I have argued that it is the right thing to do. We  should find the money to pay for it. That is in this bill.  I support returning the 101st Airborne at Fort Campbell to its full  air assault capacity with the return of a combat aviation brigade. That  is in this bill.  I support giving our servicemembers a pay increase. That is in the  bill. But I take issue when Congress adds other things to this bill  that don't have anything to do with our military.  This bill would sanction NATO allies and potentially American energy  companies if they have any involvement with Nord Stream 2 pipeline.  This is a pipeline between Russia and Germany. The pipeline is  basically done. It may well be completed in the next few months. The  pipeline will be completed. Yet we want to jeopardize our relationship  with our allies and with businesses both in Europe and America.  This bill would also drop more sanctions into the middle of the  Syrian civil war, as well as funding for so-called ``vetted'' Syrian  rebel groups. All this would do is prolong the Syrian civil war and,  with it, the humanitarian suffering and displacement we have seen in  the region. The Syrian civil war is largely over. I agree with  President Trump that it is time to come home.  Another problem with our insatiable appetite for more military  spending is that it requires conservatives to make bad compromises. If  you want $40 billion in new defense spending, then you have to give the  liberals $40 billion new domestic spending. If anything, that is the  real nature of today's bipartisanship: You can have your money as long  as we get our money.  The dirty little secret in Washington is that there is actually too  much compromise. Republicans want more military spending; Democrats  want more welfare money. And with each new Congress, Congress always  chooses to spend and borrow more money.  For example, this bill provides a new mandatory benefit program: paid  parental leave for all Federal employees, starting next year. The  program will cost over $3 billion forever--and most of these programs  continue to expand forever. The program will cost $3 billion a year,  and, of course, there is nothing in the bill that tells how we are  going to pay for it. So we are going to have paid leave, everybody, but  we are going to borrow the money from China to give this great benefit.  In essence, today, Congress is simply saying: Add it to my tab; the  deficit be damned. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, this  represents a better benefit than many working Americans enjoy, and it  has nothing to do with national defense.  Conservatism is more than supporting military spending at any cost.  We have to do more and make tough decisions that enable a strong  national defense and a balanced budget.  Many so-called conservatives will hail this bloated military  spending, but, in truth, there is nothing fiscally conservative about  borrowing money from China to pay for our military. In fact, I would  argue that borrowing money to buy more tanks or planes or to police the  far corners of the Earth actually damages our national security.  Some have argued that our military is hollowed out, exhausted from so  many far-flung conflicts--probably true. They will argue that we must  expand military spending to meet the mission.  Perhaps we should entertain the opposite argument. Perhaps it is not  that our military budget is too small but [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7065"">Page S7065</a>, ] that our military mission is too large. I, for one, hope for a day when  Congress rediscovers that our constitutional mandate is to defend  America first and only to become involved in war as a last resort and,  even then, America should only become involved in war when Congress has  debated and done its constitutional duty to declare war.  Until that day, I will continue to argue that the only fiscally  conservative, fiscally responsible action is to vote against expanding  the military budget. I encourage my fellow Senators to consider that.  I yield back.    "

Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:36 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, December 4, 2019, at 10 a.m.    "
676,Gary Peters,5.015462875366211,D,peters,peters," Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  For 40 years, the city of San Diego has treated the region's sewage  through the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant. It is a chemically  enhanced primary treatment facility that treats wastewater to a level  that can be discharged into the ocean without harming the environment.  The Clean Water Act generally requires sewer systems to implement a  secondary level of treatment. However, scientists at the Scripps  Institution of Oceanography have consistently said that forcing San  Diego ratepayers to pay billions of dollars to upgrade the Point Loma  facility to secondary treatment would be a waste of money because the  enhanced advanced treatment the plant currently provides, combined with  its 4-mile-long outfall, causes no harm to the ocean environment. In  fact, the construction of a new facility along the coastline could do  more harm than good. For these reasons, San Diego has been allowed to  avoid building a new facility through a Federal waiver process at a  cost of millions of dollars every 5 years.  Water has always been in short supply in southern California, yet,  during my first years on the San Diego City Council in the early 2000s,  I was one of only three council members to support blackwater recycling  to improve the reliability of our regional water supply.  Even though all water is recycled, our opponents at the time dubbed  it ``toilet to tap.'' Now, however, we recognize that historic  droughts, combined with the shortage of melting snow, have made our  water supply shortage a permanent challenge for the West. And today,  San Diego's proposed water recycling plan with the more accurate  moniker, the ``pure water program,'' has widespread support from among  local elected leaders, environmental advocates, and State regulators.  In 2019, I introduced the Ocean Pollution Reduction Act II, or OPRA  II, to support the dual goals of increasing fresh water supply and  reducing pollution output to the ocean.  Under OPRA II, the city of San Diego must demonstrate that the pure  water program can produce 83 million gallons a day of water by 2036.  This is an estimated one-third of the entire city's drinking water  needs. Over the same period, the program is expected to reduce  pollution discharge from the Point Loma plant by over 100 million  gallons.  Pure water will still require substantial investment from San Diego  ratepayers; however, this bill replaces the complex and expensive  secondary treatment waiver application with a simpler and more  environmentally effective process if the city meets stringent water  recycling milestones.  OPRA II has been a decades-long labor of love among the city of San  Diego, its regional partners, and State and Federal Government. It will  deploy cost-effective technology and will protect our region's water  sources, technology that could one day be deployed by other vulnerable  communities to help address water shortage issues.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I thank my  colleagues.    "
677,Rob Portman,1.647953987121582,R,portman,portman, Mr. PORTMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table.    
678,Jack Reed,0.346327006816864,D,reed,reed," Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the HOSPICE bill,  which is a part of the overall BENES Act we are debating today. And I  am proud to support the HOSPICE bill that I introduced and authored  with my good friend, Jimmy Panetta, from California.  Madam Speaker, I can tell you, when loved ones, like my mother,  became sick, it is common to be left feeling helpless and for families  not having the resources to deal with that terrible situation. But I  thank God every day we were able to support my mother with a wonderful  team, not only of our family but of our hospice care providers. They  gave her, and they gave us, the needed companionship and resources to  have some sense of normalcy at the end of her illness. That experience  reaffirmed the critical importance of the quality-of-life care that  hospice care represents.  Madam Speaker, that is why I am a hospice volunteer in my personal  time here in Washington, D.C. I am a strong advocate for hospice care  across America.  However, while most hospice employees and volunteers and  compassionate caregivers are good, hardworking individuals, there are  some who neglect and potentially even abuse patients in that situation.  We must hold those bad actors accountable. We must demand additional  oversight of hospice providers. We must educate providers with  additional training to ensure patients receive the best and most proper  level of care they deserve.  We are confident this legislation would do just that by giving HHS  the tools it needs to penalize those that provide poor quality care.  Our legislation would also improve provider transparency by requiring  States to maintain a toll-free hotline where abuse and neglect can be  reported.  Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand in support of this legislation.  More importantly, I am proud to be a hospice volunteer myself, and I am  proud to stand with the hospice community that is giving so much great  quality care to those that need it most in their most precious time  that they have left.  Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill and the  underlying legislation upon which it rides.    "
679,James Risch,0.3485189974308014,R,risch,risch," Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I rise today on a more somber note to pay tribute to members of the Hansen family who recently lost their lives in a tragic accident. For Jim Hansen, family is what mattered most in life. This past Thanksgiving, he was with his sons, grandsons, and great-grandson, participating in an annual hunting activity that had become a family tradition. On November 30, 2019, they were returning from this cherished family time, when a tragic plane accident took the lives of nine members of the Hansen family: Jim Hansen, Sr., Jim Hansen, Jr., Kirk Hansen, Stockton Hansen, Logan Hansen, Kyle Naylor, Tyson Dennert, Jake Hansen, and Houston Hansen. My wife Vicki and I offer our deepest condolences and our hearts go out to the remaining family members during this overwhelmingly difficult time. Their loss will not only be felt throughout their community in eastern Idaho, but also by countless others throughout the world who have been touched by their religious and philanthropic service. The miraculous survival of Josh Hansen, Matt Hansen, and Thomas Long is a tender mercy to their remaining loved ones and will hopefully bring a measure of healing for their families. Jim Hansen, Sr., spent his entire life building a legacy steeped in a strong sense of commitment to family, a touchstone to guide future generations. Being born into a family known for hard work and business acumen, as well as caring for people in need, Jim, Jr., and Kirk harnessed their entrepreneurial spirit to expand the family business into other successful ventures that had a significant impact on their home community of Idaho Falls. The success of their values and vision was manifest in the growth of their business endeavors and their global impact. Kirk and Jim were passionate about bringing hope to others, and that hope took shape in several forms. With the guidance and insight of their remarkable wives, Kirk and Jim helped found Kyani Caring Hands. For nearly a decade, this organization dedicated a significant portion of its time, energy, and financial resources to respond to disasters and support poverty-stricken [[<a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7108"">Page S7108</a>]] communities throughout the world, with a special focus on improving children's nutrition and education. The tragic plane accident that claimed the lives of these Idaho sons will forever cement the ideals and values that motivated these men to do good where good was needed. Idaho said farewell to several great men who were not only pillars of the community, but also beloved by employees everywhere. Jim Hansen, Sr., and his two sons, Kirk and Jim, Jr., were known throughout the world as men who were passionate about helping others and touching lives wherever they went. The Hansen men and children who lost their lives in this tragic plane accident will be deeply missed, but their legacy will not be forgotten.<bullet>   "
680,Pat Roberts,1.3546299934387207,R,roberts,roberts," Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I am honored to pay tribute to Johnny  Isakson. I don't know how I could top anything that has been mentioned  by Senator Perdue and, especially, Senator Coons--Senator Chris Coons  has given us a charge to follow Johnny's example--and Senator Grassley  and now Senator Murray and everybody who will follow me.  I have a problem. I did all of this on Veterans Day. I tried to point  out that his committee has passed 57 bills. I don't know of any other  committee that has done that on behalf of the people who wear the  uniform of the United States--who do so much on our behalf--and, more  especially, for the VA and what that is all about. There has never been  a better chairman than Johnny Isakson. I said all of that. I also said,  in this body, there are those who choose ideology and partisan issues  while Johnny is someone who works with his colleagues to pass  legislation that benefits not only our Nation's veterans but every  American's pocketbook and daily life.  The reason I just sort of read through that is that we have just had  lunch wherein nearly every Senator was in attendance with the exception  of those who are running for President, and they would have liked to  have been there. By my count, there were seven standing ovations-- seven. Each Member, both of the leaders, and the people who have served  with Johnny either as a minority member or as a chairman gave their  amazing tributes to this wonderful man.  Isn't it amazing that in this very difficult time in the Senate, when  the bar of civility is about forehead high--you don't want to run into  it here--that here is a man who has given us a way out? I have never  seen that before.  Johnny has had, I think, 50 years of public service. I have him beat  if you add in staff time and 40 years of public service--by the way, of  being elected 24 to 0. I have never seen such an outpouring of  affection and genuine admiration for an individual, be he a Member of  the House or the Senate, as was experienced at this lunch.  It was Chris Coons who, during his tribute, said: Why don't we use  this as a wonderful way to see if we can get past all of the trials and  tribulations that we have gone through in the Senate and work together  for a change? People talked about, when they had come to the Senate,  that it wasn't this way. Actually, it was. Yet we look very fondly upon  the past. So I hope that people can take Chris's challenge to heart.  It is a pretty easy deal. Johnny knows it by heart, for that is who  he is; yet, if a person or a group of people or Senators in this body  love to come down here and make speech after speech--in many cases,  they are very partisan, and many of the younger Members do this--I give  them that. I mean, that is their right. I remember, in the early days  when I was in the House, that I did that a couple of times and then was  talked to by some of the senior Members who said: We don't do that here  in order to get along, especially in the all-powerful House Agriculture  Committee and now the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry  Committee. We always work together because we are nonpartisan on that  committee.  So you ignore that. Then, if you really do take the time to know that  individual, as opposed to the individual you have seen on the floor,  you will find out this is a person who is very interesting. You will  find out this is a person worth knowing. You will find out that you  have common ground. You will find out that you can get a vote for them  in order for them to vote for the farm bill or for a veterans' program  or for any other thing.  So I think that is the example that Johnny has set. I don't know if  there is anything more I can add after seven standing ovations and  obviously many, many people actually telling the truth about you. I  know, Johnny, it must be a little much for you. Frankly, I am getting a  little tired of it.  I would just like to say what I said back then when I was speaking of  your tremendous success as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee  when I said: ``Johnny, thank you for your service; now thank you for  your message; now thank you for being simply who you are.'' And I said:  ``Senators eventually come and Senators go.''  I do not think we will see the likes of Senator Johnny Isakson for  years to come. We love you. I love you. I will miss you greatly. Thank  you for your fortitude and courage in fighting Parkinson's as an  example to so many.  Semper fi, my dear friend.  I yield the floor.    "
681,Mitt Romney,0.4144819974899292,R,romney,romney," Mr. ROMNEY. Madam President, I rise today to honor the extraordinary  service of one of Utah's most dedicated county commissioners, Mr.  Newell Harward. He has served Wayne County for the past 7 years, but he  has taken on responsibility well beyond that, advocating for rural Utah  with honor and distinction as chairman of the Six County Association of  Governments. Newell has had an esteemed career and life of service to  family, country, and God.  Growing up on the family farm in Loa, UT, Newell gained an early  appreciation for the value of community, family, and hard work. He also  developed a spirit of adventure, later serving a mission abroad in  Scotland and joining the Wayne County Flying Club.  As the founder of Harward and Rees Construction, Newell is also an  entrepreneur whose craftsmanship is literally built into Utah's  infrastructure. His company has undertaken everything from city water  projects, designs at Lake Powell, to a new bridge over Hell's Backbone  in Southern Utah.  Newell is perhaps most widely known as a public servant who was  elected to serve as Wayne County commissioner. After 4 years, Newell  considered stepping down due to illness, but he was undeterred. With a  writing campaign, Newell Harward was reelected in a landslide. In  October of this year, the President welcomed Newell to the White House  to recognize him for his lifelong advocacy on behalf of rural  Americans.  A true appreciation for Newell's life of service would be incomplete  without recognizing his unwavering faith and service to the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Newell has served in three  bishoprics, as bishop of a large ward, and in the stake presidency. As  a loving father to Kelly, Lynette, Sarah, Shonna, Carol, and Travis, a  grandfather to 18, and a great-grandfather to 3, Newell has left an  indelible mark on Wayne County, the great State of Utah, and indeed our  Nation.  All of us should strive to live our lives as Newell does, with an  overwhelming love of family and community, an enduring faith, and a  boundless spirit of adventure.  Newell, Gloria, and their family continue to be in our prayers as  they fight health challenges with great courage. May God bless the  Harward family.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    "
682,Jacky Rosen,0.7565169930458069,D,rosen,rosen," Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I stand here today in opposition to the  nomination of Lawrence VanDyke to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in  Nevada, and I stand here today because I think we can all agree--no  matter where you are from--that Federal judges in our States should  come from our communities, and they should reflect our communities.  It is unfortunate to see this Chamber disregard Nevada's voice and  move forward with Mr. VanDyke's nomination. The State of Nevada has  numerous qualified lawyers and judges who have done good work and have  good reputations in our communities, who are nonpartisan, and who would  make excellent additions to the Ninth Circuit. But the White House  didn't nominate any of these qualified individuals for the Ninth  Circuit. Instead, the President nominated Lawrence VanDyke, a man who  wasn't born in Nevada, didn't grow up in Nevada, didn't go to school in  Nevada, and doesn't live in Nevada now. He hasn't even set foot in  Nevada for over a year.  This administration has nominated someone to serve on the Nevada seat  of the Ninth Circuit who--and let me be clear--is not a Nevadan. Mr.  VanDyke is, however, a Washington, DC, lawyer and failed political  candidate from Montana who was nominated to further his and this  administration's extreme political views.  His nomination is being imposed on the people of Nevada, despite the  many qualified individuals in our own State--individuals who are  respected on both sides of the aisle.  As if Mr. VanDyke's lack of any meaningful connection to the State of  Nevada wasn't enough, Mr. VanDyke is not even qualified to hold this  post, according to the American Bar Association. In reviewing this  nominee and speaking with dozens upon dozens of his former colleagues,  the ABA found Mr. VanDyke specifically ``not qualified'' to serve in  this role. The ABA has made that finding for only 3 percent of  President Trump's judicial nominees, and Mr. VanDyke is the first in a  small group whose nomination will move forward without--let me repeat:  without--the support of either Senator representing the State where he  will sit on the bench if confirmed. That we would allow someone who is  not qualified to hold a lifetime position in such a critically  important role is, frankly, absurd, and it is something no Senator  should support, no matter the party of the President who nominated  them.  The ABA's report found Mr. VanDyke to be lacking in knowledge of day- to-day practice, including procedural rules. The report found Mr.  VanDyke to be lacking humility and an open [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S6920"">Page S6920</a>, ] mind, and the ABA's report found Mr. VanDyke to be lacking a commitment  to the truth.  In order to see how the ABA came to this conclusion, one only needs  to look at Mr. VanDyke's record of pursuing an ideological agenda  instead of working for the people and defending the law. In his past  role as attorney general of Montana, he filed many politically driven  briefs, including one asking the Supreme Court to strike down Roe v.  Wade altogether, a view that is out of step with the views of Nevadans.  He even signed the State onto one brief without reading it, by his own  admission.  Mr. VanDyke has also made controversial and appalling statements  about LGBTQ Americans, writing this: ``[There is] ample reason for  concern that same-sex marriage will hurt families, and consequentially  children and society.''  Mr. VanDyke was given every opportunity to disavow this statement and  repeatedly declined to do so. Allowing Mr. VanDyke to serve on the  Ninth Circuit would put at risk the rights of thousands of LGBTQ  Americans to employment, healthcare, housing, and basic equal treatment  in what is often the court of last resort.  Surely you must agree, no matter who is President or who controls the  Senate, you would want qualified judges with connections to the State  who will be fair to your constituents and not use cases to advance  their personal ideological agenda.  I oppose the nomination of Mr. VanDyke, and if it is withdrawn or  voted down, I will be ready at a moment's notice to work with this  White House in finding a fair, qualified, and nonpartisan nominee from  Nevada. The people of my home State and yours deserve nothing less.  I yield the floor.    "
683,Mike Rounds,0.4855540096759796,R,rounds,rounds," Mr. ROUNDS. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    "
684,Marco Rubio,3.5885019302368164,R,rubio,rubio," Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague Senator Scott  for offering this and all of our colleagues and, of course, all of the  Senators who voted for it unanimously.  My colleague from Florida has already mentioned the three names of  those in the service of our country who lost their lives in Pensacola.  I will talk about them more in a moment.  I do want to say a couple of things. First, Pensacola really is one  of the hidden gems of the State that Senator Scott and I represent. To  understand Pensacola, you must understand that is it not just a city in  which a naval facility is located. The Navy is very [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7137"">Page S7137</a>, ] much a part of the fiber of that community. I would almost equate it to  a college town's relationship with a university; that is how much its  identity is connected to this naval air station. This attack wasn't  just an attack on this facility, but it was an attack on the heart and  soul of Pensacola as a community.  As I had an opportunity to visit in the aftermath of the attack, I  was not just deeply saddened by the loss of life but impacted, first,  by the way the community responded and, second, by some of the stories,  which I hope we will learn more about as the information comes out, of  extraordinary bravery--not just the first responders but others who  happened to be there at that time who exhibited extraordinary stories  of heroism in the face of evil in this terror attack. People rushed  into the building the gunshots were coming from instead of running away  as most people would do. I want to point out some of those things.  ENS Joshua Kaleb Watson, who was mentioned earlier, happened to be  the officer on deck at the time of the shooting, and he ran toward the  shooter and was yelling for people to get out of the way. He actually  proceeded to tackle the killer and fought him in an attempt to disarm  him, all while being shot at least five separate times. He was wounded,  but he, nevertheless, happened to make his way out to flag down first  responders and be able to give an accurate description of the shooter,  which ultimately allowed him to be neutralized.  Amn Mohammed Haitham's family moved to St. Petersburg from New  Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. His school's assistant principal  called him ``the Perfect One'' because he was a good student, a track  star, and basketball player. This is a quote from the assistant  principal:  [He] would walk into any room and it would light up. He had   this magnetic personality--big smile, always happy. And   people would always gravitate toward him.  His commanding officer told his father that it was his son Mohammed  who had also bravely attempted to take down the gunman and lost his  life.  Then there was Cameron Walters of Georgia, described as ``an amazing  guy, he always had something good to say to everybody, and was always  smiling.''  The morning of the shooting, Airman Walters was randomly assigned to  watch duty in Building 633. He had been stationed in Pensacola for only  2 weeks before this attack.  Again, I want to thank Senator Scott, my colleague of Florida, for  offering this. It ensures that not only will we not forget the heroes  who sacrificed their lives while protecting fellow Navy members as this  tragedy unfolded, but it also reminds us of the obligation we have to  get to the bottom of how this happened and why this happened so that it  may never, ever happen anywhere again.  I yield the floor.    "
685,Bernard Sanders,0.1361510008573532,R,sanders,sanders," Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I congratulate my friend and the senior  Senator from Vermont, Patrick Leahy, for casting his 16,000th vote in  the U.S. Senate. Since he was first elected in 1974, Senator Leahy has  worked tirelessly for the people of Vermont, bringing to Washington,  DC, Vermont values: a belief in justice, civic engagement, and the  importance of community. Senator Leahy has long been a champion of  human rights, a steward of the environment, and his efforts have  brought important Federal resources to our State. I join with his wife  Marcelle, his children and grandchildren, and Vermonters throughout our  State in congratulating him on this milestone vote and thanking him for  his 44 years of dedicated service. I look forward to continuing to work  together to represent the people of Vermont.    "
686,Ben Sasse,0.16762299835681915,R,sasse,sasse," Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, farmers and ranchers are in a tough spot.  There are a lot of families who are on the edge of bankruptcy in my  State and in ag country more broadly. As we get closer to Christmas and  to the new year without having a trade deal with Canada and Mexico, the  situation is getting bleaker.  Let's be blunt about this. By needlessly stonewalling the USMCA trade  agreement, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats are taking  Nebraska's agriculture hostage. This is petty, stupid politics at its  worst.  The USMCA trade deal is a free-trade win for our farmers and  ranchers, and they desperately need this win right now. With hard work  and grit, Nebraskans have cultivated one of the most powerful  agricultural economies in the history of the world. We literally feed  the world, and we do it with free trade because we grow so much more  food than we could ever consume. We need export markets, and lots of  people around the world want to be consuming our ag products.  It is pretty simple: Trade with Canada and Mexico is a win-win-win.  In 2018, Mexico and Canada bought more than $40 billion worth of  American agricultural products. The U.S. International Trade Commission  expects the USMCA to increase that trade by more than $33 billion. The  USMCA trade deal is designed to reinforce those partnerships in ways  that make sense for an economy that has changed a lot since NAFTA was  passed in the 1990s.  In the 1990s, ``Seinfeld'' was still on TV; we still watched movies  on VHS tape; and we took our pictures with these things of which the  pages probably don't know--cameras that had film. I will be honest. At  my house, we still watch ``Seinfeld,'' but we have happily moved on  from VHS tapes. My teenage daughters set us up on Hulu streaming, but I  can't make the remote work.  Over the last 20 years, we have seen a massive digital revolutionary  change in nearly every sector of our economy. Farmers are using new  tech to increase our productivity and to get more out of the most  fertile land on God's green Earth than people have ever assumed  possible. The USMCA trade deal makes that kind of basic improvement in  our trading relationships with our neighbors, and we need that in this  rapidly changing, evolving, and developing economy. For example, it  scraps the old rules about importing cars that still have cassette tape  players. Chuck Grassley, apparently, still has a car that has a  cassette tape player, but he is proud of it, so we won't make fun of  him here.  Passing the USMCA would secure long-term stability in our trade  agreements with our partners across North America, and it would also  send a signal to other potential partners around the world that the  United States is open for business. We need to bring Japan, the  European Union, and others to the negotiating table, and passing the  USMCA would strengthen our position significantly in setting up those  trade agreements. Time is running out.  If we don't pass the USMCA this year, we are going to send a very  different signal to our potential partners. If Speaker Pelosi and the  House Democrats can't get their act together on the USMCA, they will be  telling the whole world that we may or may not be open for business--it  all depends on short-term political posturing. That is the message they  are sending now, and that is the message that might be cemented if this  calendar year ends without our passing the USMCA. Try running a  convenience store like that, and you will be out of business in a  month.  A lot of folks in San Francisco and New York City may not think much  about beans and corn prices, but every farmer and rancher in Nebraska  is beyond baffled that this no-brainer trade deal hasn't been passed  yet. It is simply in the best long-term interests of everyone involved  in this conversation. This is not something that should be slipping  beyond this year; this is something that should pass now. We should  call the vote on Christmas morning if that is what it takes. The  Congress should not be leaving DC without passing the USMCA.  Time is running out, and we don't want to let our farmers and  ranchers face 2020 with the uncertainty and the confusion they now  feel. These Nebraskans want to do business; they want to trade; and we  want to win.  Congress is the place where Americans deliberate about the long-term  challenges we need to face for the future of our country, but instead  of deliberation, right now what they see when they turn on their TVs or  pick up their newspapers is just vicious partisanship and short-term  posturing. The American people deserve better than this.  The clown show in the House of Representatives shouldn't bring  everything to a grinding halt. It shouldn't stop us from doing right  for farmers and ranchers. The USMCA trade agreement would pass by large  majorities if introduced on the House floor, and I speculate that it  would get between 85 and 90 votes on this floor. Obviously, we can't  take it up until the House votes. The House would pass it with a big  majority. That means only Nancy Pelosi stands in the way of USMCA's  certainty for the world's greatest producers. Everyone knows this, and  Speaker Pelosi should be scheduling the vote.  We have only 28 days left in 2019, but that is plenty of time to vote  on the USMCA. That is plenty of time to get a win for our farmers and  ranchers.  Speaker Pelosi, please schedule the vote.    "
687,Brian Schatz,0.8039230108261108,D,schatz,schatz," Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.  Let's get clear about what is happening here. The first thing is we  did something momentous as a group. We, on a bipartisan basis, decided  to provide paid parental leave of 12 weeks for the Federal workforce-- 2.1 million Federal workers--so that individuals who are new parents  don't have to make that impossible choice between receiving a paycheck  and being a new dad or a new mom. Now, this is catching us up with the  rest of the world. The rest of the industrialized world understands  that this isn't just a humane thing to do for families. This is the  right way to manage the workforce because you get higher productivity;  you get better morale; and you get lower turnover. This is a smart  thing to do.  There were 2.1 million people covered by this momentous change of  Federal policy agreed upon over the last 48 hours on a bipartisan  basis. There was a technical problem, and so the following Federal  employees are not going to be covered unless we make this technical  fix: employees of the DC courts, public defenders, Presidential  appointees, FAA, and CSA employees, and article I judges. Everybody  else is going to get 12 weeks of paid parental leave, except for these  people. We can solve that today.  That is what my unanimous consent request is all about. What the  Senator from Pennsylvania has decided to do is take a hostage and say,  These are the only Federal employees who are not going to get this  benefit because of a technical and drafting error because I didn't get  something totally unrelated that has to do with a tax bill that was  passed on purely partisan lines in a hurry, written primarily by  lobbyists in the middle of the night.  Now, I do not mind entertaining a change to the Tax Code to deal with  this question of how you expense the renovation of restaurants and  retail operations, but I think Senator Wyden is exactly right. I guess  the Senator from Pennsylvania thought this was a talking point on the  Republican side. Heaven forbid if there should be a negotiation. Heaven  forbid something that is as important to the Republicans that is as a  result of their screw-up and would cost tens of billions of dollars  would not be given away for free.  The argument being made is, hey, technical for technical. This is an  actual technical fix. This is a bill we just enacted in the last 48  hours. I am not even sure if the President has signed it yet, but it is  about to be enacted into law, and nobody is arguing that we should not  cover some small portion of the Federal workforce.  Nobody is arguing that was the legislative intent. Nobody is arguing  that is public policy. What the Senator from Pennsylvania is saying, If  I don't get my thing, then these people don't get the help that they  deserve. These people, by happenstance of a drafting error, don't get  paid parental leave. Now, this has human consequences.  I object to the Senator's modification of my unanimous consent  request, and I am deeply disappointed that we can't fix this simple  thing. I am happy to work with the Senator from Pennsylvania on a quick  fix. I think we will get there at some point next year, but this has to  be part of a broader bipartisan deal, and he knows that.  This is going to cost tens of billions of dollars, and no one gives  tens of billions of dollars for nothing. Everything of that magnitude  has to be negotiated on a bipartisan, bicameral basis. That is not what  he is trying to do. He is trying to say because we made a technical  error that was monumentally wrong and, as a result of the flawed  process, why don't we trade technical fixes. This is a relatively small  technical fix, and he wants to trade it for a massive technical fix  that is now 2 years old.  The only thing I would say is this may be small in the context of how  we operate in the U.S. Senate. It is not small if you work for the FAA  and you are a new dad. It is not small if you are an article I judge  and you are a new mom. It is not small for these people who deserve  paid parental leave like every other Federal employee will get soon.    "
688,Charles Schumer,0.5495330095291138,D,schumer,schumer," Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, last night, the House of Representatives  voted to impeach President Donald Trump. It is only the third time in  our Nation's history that the President of the United States has been  impeached.  The articles of impeachment charge that President Trump abused the  powers of his office by soliciting the interference of a foreign power  in our elections, not for the good of the country but to benefit  himself personally. The articles also charge that the President  obstructed Congress in the investigation of those matters. Together,  these articles suggest the President committed a grave injury to our  grand democracy.  The conduct they describe is very much what the Founders feared when  they forged the impeachment powers of the Congress. The Founders, in  their wisdom, gave the House the power to accuse and the Senate the  power to judge. We are now asked to fulfill our constitutional role as  a court of impeachment.  Now that the House of Representatives has impeached President Trump,  the Nation turns its eyes to the Senate. What will the Nation see? Will  the Nation see what Alexander Hamilton saw--a body of government with  ``confidence enough . . . to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the  necessary impartiality,'' or will the Nation see the Senate dragged  into the depths of partisan fervor?  The Nation just witnessed how the Republican leader sees his role in  this chapter of our history--demonstrating both an unfortunate descent  into partisanship and demonstrating the fundamental weakness of the  President's defense.  Leader McConnell claimed that the impeachment of President Trump is  illegitimate because the House voted along party lines. Forgive me, but  House Democrats cannot be held responsible for the cravenness of the  House Republican caucus and their blind fealty to the President.  Leader McConnell claimed that the impeachment was motivated by  partisan rage--this from the man who said proudly, ``I am not  impartial. I have no intention to be impartial at all'' in the trial of  President Trump. What hypocrisy.  Leader McConnell accused the House Democrats of an obsession to get  rid of President Trump--this from the man who proudly declared his  ``number one goal'' was to make President Obama a one-term President.  Leader McConnell claimed that Democrats impeached the President for  asserting Executive privilege. President Trump never formally claimed  Executive privilege; he claimed ``absolute immunity,'' and the White  House Counsel wrote a letter stating simply that the administration  would not comply with any subpoenas.  Leader McConnell claimed that the Democrats' ``obsession'' with  impeachment has prevented the House from pursuing legislation to help  the American people. Leader McConnell knows very, very well that the  House Democratic majority has passed literally hundreds of bills that  gather dust here in the Senate, condemned to a legislative graveyard by  none other than Leader McConnell himself, who proudly called himself  the Grim Reaper.  Members of the 116th Senate have been denied the opportunity to  legislate by Leader McConnell. We aren't even allowed to debate the  issues that would impact the American people: healthcare,  infrastructure, prescription drugs. We could have spent the year  debating these issues. We weren't doing impeachment. Leader McConnell  has chosen not to focus on these issues and to put none of these bills  on the floor. As he reminds us often, he alone decides what goes on the  floor. [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7171"">Page S7171</a>, ]  Leader McConnell claimed that the House did not afford the President  due process. The leader knows well that President Trump refused to  participate in the process, despite invitation, and blocked witnesses  and documents from Congress in unprecedented fashion.  Leader McConnell claimed that the House ran the ``most rushed, least  thorough, and most unfair impeachment inquiry in modern history.'' I  know that is the Republican talking point, but here is the reality:  Leader McConnell is plotting the most rushed, least thorough, and most  unfair impeachment trial in modern history. His plan to prevent House  managers from calling witnesses to prove their case is a dramatic break  from precedent.  We heard a lot about precedent from the leader. Never has there been  a Presidential impeachment trial in which the majority prevented the  House managers from fairly presenting their case, to have witnesses  explain their knowledge of the alleged malfeasance. Will Leader  McConnell, breaking precedent, strong-arm his caucus into making this  the first Senate impeachment trial of a President in history that heard  no witnesses?  We ask: Is the President's case so weak that none of the President's  men can defend him under oath? Is the President's case so weak that  none of the President's men can defend him under oath? If the House  case is so weak, why is Leader McConnell so afraid of witnesses and  documents? We believe the House case is strong, very strong, but if the  Republican leader believes it is so weak, why is he so afraid of  relevant witnesses and documents, which will not prolong things very  long in our proposal--four hours for each witness?  It is true, as the leader has said, that the Framers built the Senate  to provide stability and to keep partisan passions from boiling over.  However, their vision of the Senate is a far cry from the partisan body  Senator McConnell has created.  I hope America was watching the Republican leader deliver his speech.  I really do, because most glaring of all was the fact that Leader  McConnell's 30-minute partisan stem-winder contained hardly a single  defense of the President of the United States on the merits. Almost  none have defended President Trump because they can't.  In the wake of an enormous amount of evidence uncovered by House  investigators--much of it in the form of testimony by top Trump  officials whom the administration tried to silence--the Republican  leader could not rebut the accusations against the President with  facts. The Republican leader complained about the process. The  Republican leader made very partisan and inflammatory accusations about  Democrats, but he did not advance an argument in defense of the  President's conduct on the merits. That, in and of itself, is a damning  reflection on the state of the President's defense.  Our goal in the Senate, above all, should be to conduct a fair and  speedy trial. I have proposed a very reasonable structure that would do  just that: four witnesses, only those with direct knowledge of the  charges made by the House; only those who could provide new, relevant  and potentially illumination testimony; strict time limits on each  stage of the process to prevent the trial from dragging out too long.  It is eminently reasonable; it is eminently fair. A group with no  partisan bias would come up with this type of proposal.  I have yet to hear one good argument as to why less evidence is  better than more evidence, particularly in such a serious moment as  impeachment of the President of the United States. In Leader  McConnell's 30-minute screed, he did not make one argument as to why  witnesses and documents should not be a part of the trial.  President Trump protests that he did not receive due process in the  House impeachment inquiry. Due process is the ability to respond to  charges made against you and present your side of the case. The  President was invited to provide witnesses and provide documents at  every stage of the process. He chose not to.  Still, Democrats are offering the President due process again here in  the Senate. The witnesses we suggest are top Trump-appointed officials.  They aren't Democrats. We don't know if their testimony would exculpate  the President or incriminate him, but their testimony should be heard.  If the President's counsel wants to call other witnesses with direct  knowledge of why the aid to Ukraine was delayed, we say that they  should be able to do so. President Trump claims he wants due process. I  suspect he would rather hide or name-call because if he really wanted  due process, he could get it easily. One phone call to Leader McConnell  telling him to let his aides testify, one phone call to his chief of  staff telling him to release the documents to Congress--both of these  actions would let the truth come out. I ask again: Can none of the  President's men come defend him under oath?  To my Republican colleagues, our message is a simple one. Democrats  want a fair trial that examines the relevant facts. We want a fair  trial. The message from Leader McConnell at the moment is that he has  no intention of conducting a fair trial, no intention of acting  impartially, no intention of getting the facts.  Despite our disagreements, I will meet with Leader McConnell soon to  discuss the rules, but each Senator will influence whether the Senate  lives up to its constitutional duty to serve as an impartial court of  impeachment. In the coming weeks, Republican senators will face a  choice. Each Republican Senator will face a choice. Do they want a fair  trial or do they want to allow the President free rein? Each Senator  must ask himself or herself: Do you want a fair trial or do you want  the President to do whatever he wants, regardless of the rule of law,  regardless of the consequences to this great Nation?  The Nation turns its eyes to the Senate. What will it see?  The President of the United States has spent the past several months  telling Congress that it has no right to oversight and no right to  investigate any of his activities; that he has absolute immunity; that  article II of the Constitution gives him the ``right to do whatever he  wants.'' Those are the President's words. Past Senates have disagreed  with such views and strongly, proudly stood up for the notion that the  President is not omnipotent. Democrats have done it; Republicans have  done it--and often Presidents of their own party.  The Senate has said in the past that the President serves the people,  not himself; that he is not a King. Will it do so again or will it  shirk from that responsibility?  If the Republicans lead with the majority leader's scheme to sweep  these charges under the rug and permit the President to ignore  Congress, they will be creating a new precedent that will long be  remembered as one of the Senate's darkest chapters. It will be  remembered as a time when a simple majority in the Senate sought to  grant two new rights to the President: the right to use the government  for personal purposes and the right to ignore Congress at his pleasure.  Here I agree with Senator McConnell: ``Moments like this are why the  Senate exists.'' If the President commits high crimes and misdemeanors  and the Congress can do nothing about it, not even conduct a fair  tribunal where his conduct is judged by dispassionate representatives  of the people, then the President can commit those crimes with  impunity. This President can; others can.  I have little doubt that if we tell the President that he can escape  scrutiny in this instance, he will do it again and again and again.  Future Presidents will take note and may do worse. The most powerful  check on the Executive, the one designed to protect the people from  tyranny, will be erased.  This chapter in our history books could be a lesson about the erosion  of checks and balances in our modern age or it could be a proud  reaffirmation of those founding principles. This chapter in our history  books could be about the overpowering partisanship of our times or it  could be about the Senate's capacity to overcome it. Again, moments  like this are why the U.S. Senate exists.  I yield the floor.    "

Mr. President, today I would like to take a moment to recognize Ms. Nancy Whitworth of Greenville, SC, for her over 40 years of service to Greenville County. I extend my congratulations to her on her upcoming retirement and wish to reflect on her successful career. As the longtime economic developer and deputy city manager for the city of Greenville, Nancy was responsible for commercial and neighborhood revitalization, downtown development, business recruitment and retention, planning and zoning, and building codes. She has also authored articles on Greenville's award-winning downtown and meets frequently with other cities to share Greenville's success story. Last year, she was awarded with the 2018 Local Economic Developer of the Year award. Ms. Whitworth is to be commended for her role in spurring the dramatic growth and revitalization Greenville [[<a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7026"">Page S7026</a>]] has seen in the past decades. Through her leadership and dedication to her community, she has been an invaluable asset to the Upstate of South Carolina. Ms. Whitworth is a shining example of a dedicated public servant and should inspire us all to give our best to our communities. I would like to personally commend and thank Ms. Whitworth for her decades of service that encouraged Greenville's economic prosperity and success.<bullet>   "
691,Rick Scott,0.4253840148448944,R,scott,scott," Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, as a member of U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my honor to recognize a unique small business for its tremendous contributions to the local economy. Small businesses drive our Nation's economic expansion, generate lasting job growth, and encourage community development. This week, it is my honor to recognize Boyd Cycling of Greenville, SC, as the Senate Small Business of the Week. Boyd Johnson, a former competitive cyclist, originally founded Boyd Cycling under the name Boyd Bikes in September of 2009. Charged by a mission of quality and service, Boyd set out to produce and sell various bike products in the Greenville area. About 3 months into the operation, Boyd's Bikes began to grow dramatically, and Boyd's wife Nicole joined as a partner of the business. Boyd and Nicole are a prime example of how a leap of faith, coupled with hard work, can pay off. Boyd Bikes initially offered wheels, bike frames, handlebars, and other accessories, but the Johnsons quickly realized that their competitive advantage was their handcrafted wheels made out of carbon fiber and alloy. By 2011, Boyd and Nicole decided to focus directly on specializing in bike wheels and changed the name of the business to Boyd Cycling. In addition to focusing on bike wheels, Boyd and Nicole decided to shake up their business model. Originally, Boyd Cycling focused primarily on direct-to-consumer sales. Wanting to expand their business, Boyd and Nicole reached out to the Spartanburg Area Small Business Development Center, SBDC, a resource partner of the U.S. Small Business Administration, and received business counseling and exporting advice. Eventually, Boyd Cycling began selling their products to bike shops around the country in addition to their own website. By staying committed to high quality and low pricing, the Johnsons have been able to avoid undercutting their retail clients while diversifying their income stream. In turn, this has enabled them to export their products globally and now currently distribute to over 15 countries. A seasoned cyclist, Boyd spends time carefully designing each product the company offers. Once a product is developed, Boyd Cycling contracts manufacturing out to different firms domestically and internationally. Boyd maintains rigorous standards when contracting with every manufacturing firm that the company uses, making sure to implement quality controls on materials and construction methods. Boyd Cycling's dedication to quality has not gone unnoticed. They have received national media coverage, excellent customer reviews, and numerous awards. In 2017 and 2019, Boyd and Nicole were named the U.S. Small Business Administration's Exporter of the Year for South Carolina. This award recognizes small business owners for their success and commitment to exporting goods or services. Boyd Cycling also supports various philanthropies in their community including Meals on Wheels, the Alzheimers Foundation, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Miracle Hill, Upstate Forever, and Global Bike. Their community involvement has been a key to their success as Greenville has become a bustling hub for the recreational biking community. Boyd and Nicole truly embody the entrepreneurial and community spirit. From its humble beginnings, Boyd has grown into a respectable player in the industry while maintaining a commitment to customer service and product [[<a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S3283"">Page S3283</a>]] quality.

692,Rick Scott,0.4253840148448944,R,scott,scott," Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, The House amendment to the Senate  amendment to ', H.R. 133, ', the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021,  includes many important provisions. Among them is Section 203 of Title  II, Division BB, based on ', H.R. 7539, "", the Strengthening Behavioral  Health Parity Act--an important step forward in improving the effective  enforcement of mental health parity laws that govern group and  individual health plans and coverage. I am pleased to see this  legislation advance as part of our continuing efforts to ensure the  promise of parity is realized for all.  As Chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor, which has  legislative jurisdiction over employee health benefit plans (including  provisions of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act and the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act or ERISA) as well as oversight  jurisdiction over the United States Department of Labor, I would like  to provide additional clarification for the record regarding the  interactions between this legislation and existing enforcement and  compliance efforts by the Secretary of Labor.  First, no provision of Section 203 in any way restricts, alters, or  otherwise interferes with the existing enforcement and oversight  authority of the Secretary of Labor, including the Secretary's  authority to investigate, audit, and seek equitable or other relief to  enforce any requirements of federal law. The requirement that the  Secretary examine the comparative analyses of at least 20 plans  annually serves as a floor, not a ceiling, on the Department's  enforcement actions, and the Department remains authorized to continue  to utilize its broad authority under Sections 502, 504, 506 of ERISA  and other laws to enforce all requirements of this bill, Part 7 of  ERISA, and any other requirements of federal law.  Second, no provision of Section 203 in any way restricts, alters, or  otherwise interferes with the rights of group health plan participants  to bring an action to enforce their rights under Section 502 of ERISA,  nor does it impact judicial review of any statutory violations. This  bill also should not be interpreted to create any additional  presumption in favor of health plans and issuers during judicial review  of nonquantitative treatment limitation (NQTL) determinations, and the  Secretary remains authorized to seek equitable or other relief,  including relief regarding the re-adjudication of claims. All  provisions should be interpreted to ensure the broadest access to  relief for plan participants.  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of the 900 billion dollar economic relief package which has been agreed  to by Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. While this  package is far from what is actually needed, it is necessary to act  right now and we do not have any additional time to wait. This bill  will direct billions of dollars in aid to unemployed individuals who  are suffering with no other hope or help in sight.  It will provide up to $600 in stimulus checks, it will extend  unemployment benefit checks, extend a moratorium on evictions for 1  month, 325 billion for business relief with 275 billion going to  paycheck protection, 82 billion for schools, 20 billion for vaccine  distribution. While this is not quite exactly what I was looking for,  it will hold us until President Biden takes the reins and leads us on.    "

697,Jeanne Shaheen,1.2449519634246826,D,shaheen,shaheen," Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to salute Walter Graff for his many years of dedicated service and forward-looking leadership at the Appalachian Mountain Club, AMC. Walter will soon retire from his role as senior vice president, the capstone to a career at AMC that began 45 years ago as a program manager in the mountains of northern New Hampshire. He leaves a legacy worthy of our praise and our gratitude. The Appalachian Mountain Club is a nearly century-and-a-half old organization with a mission of connecting people to the outdoors. Its staff and many supporters not only encourage people to explore the natural world through activities like hiking, paddling, cycling, and skiing. They are also at the forefront of conservation efforts that seek to protect our forests, mountains, rivers, and trails for future generations to enjoy and cherish. When Walter Graff was hired by the AMC in July of 1974, he spent his first months on the job screening environmental films for guests at what was then called Pinkham Notch Camp. The AMC was a much smaller organization back then with a few professional positions in New Hampshire and administrative services in Boston. But Walter had big dreams and an ambitious vision for the organization. He approached the Pinkham hutmaster at the end of the summer with the hope of developing a workshop program. He got signoff, as well as an excuse to venture outdoors. What began as a couple classes on topics like equipment maintenance and snowshoeing has since blossomed into one of the largest outdoor education programs in New England. Walter has held many titles within AMC since that summer 45 years ago. His colleagues note that his leadership has touched every facet of AMC's mission. As director of education, he was influential in launching the group's renowned outdoor skills and leadership training program. As head of the AMC's Maine Woods Initiative, he was responsible for developing a program that promotes outdoor recreation, protects natural resources, encourages responsible forestry and deepens community partnerships. To date, the program is responsible for purchasing and permanently conserving 70,000 acres of forestland and creating over 120 miles of recreational trails. As he nears his retirement, Walter is fond of looking to the past to see how much AMC has grown and how accessible our mountains, rivers, and lakes are to people across the region. He drives through the White Mountains and sees once-empty parking lots now full of people exploring the richness of the natural world. Yet Walter is also looking to the future as he approaches his final day as an AMC employee. He knows he will remain connected to the outdoors and will continue caring for the planet. On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in thanking Walter Graff for his years of service and wishing him all the best in the years ahead.<bullet>   "

699,Kyrsten Sinema,1.2197409868240356,D,sinema,sinema," Ms. SINEMA. Madam President, I rise today to address one of the  biggest concerns facing everyday families in Arizona: making healthcare  more affordable and maintaining critical healthcare protections.  Sometimes the issues discussed on the Senate floor appear far removed  from the concerns of everyday Americans, but not today. Today's debate  focuses the Senate's attention on the most important issue for many  Arizonans and offers elected officials the opportunity to reject  partisan political games in favor of commonsense solutions. [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S6225"">Page S6225</a>, ]  Not long ago, insurance companies were allowed to deny care or  overcharge Americans based on the fact that those Americans had been  sick before or had been born with a chronic condition.  Arizonans who had been previously treated for skin cancer or diabetes  were told that no insurance company would cover them or that the  insurance plans they purchased would not cover their preexisting  conditions, despite promises of comprehensive coverage. Beyond major  illnesses, Arizonans with even common conditions, such as high blood  pressure, high cholesterol, asthma, and even acne, were denied the  coverage they needed. Until recently, insurance companies had also been  allowed to charge consumers high prices for insurance plans only to  leave out coverage for essential health benefits that virtually all  Americans eventually need, such as prescription drug costs, ambulance  costs, and hospital stays--critical needs that consumers rightly expect  will be covered.  Insurance is supposed to be there when people need it. Hard-working  Americans who play by the rules and pay their monthly premiums  shouldn't have the rug pulled out from under them at the very moment  they need healthcare. That is why such discrimination against people  with preexisting health conditions is now banned and why health  insurance plans are now required to cover essential health benefits.  That is why it is so disturbing that the administration and some  Members of Congress have begun moving backward, allowing insurance  companies to again sell plans to Americans that lack the very health  protections consumers need.  Congress has a lot of work to do to make healthcare affordable and  protect access for American families and businesses, from lowering  premiums to stopping surprise medical billing, but partisan approaches  will not solve these challenges. We can and must work across the aisle  to pass bipartisan solutions, such as increasing the number of doctors  to address provider shortages, lowering costs for home health services,  expanding mental healthcare, and eliminating the health insurance tax.  I have partnered with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  sponsor legislation that achieves these goals, but allowing insurance  companies to return to their old practices will only hurt everyday  Arizona families. These health plans lack key protections. They are  often called junk plans and for good reason. Junk plans mislead  Arizonans--selling something billed as health insurance when, in fact,  it is better described as a bill of goods. When Arizonans who are sold  these plans need to actually use the coverage they paid for, the rug  gets pulled out from under them yet again.  I hear from hard-working Arizonans on a daily basis who deserve  access to critical health protections; Arizonans like Chantal, who has  a preexisting autoimmune disease that without treatment would cause her  to become blind; Arizonans like Corrine from Phoenix, whose daughter  was born with a congenital heart condition--before the law protected  people with preexisting conditions, Corrine's family was unable to find  an insurer who would cover their family--and Arizonans like John from  Casa Grande, who signed up for a plan that he was told covered  preexisting conditions only to find out after he paid his first month's  premium, that his particular preexisting condition wouldn't qualify for  coverage.  There are 2.8 million Arizonans under the age of 65 just like  Chantal, Corrine, and John who live with preexisting health conditions.  That is half of all nonelderly Arizonans whose healthcare is at risk.  These Arizonans remind us exactly what is at stake and exactly what is  wrong with partisan politics in Washington today. For too long, too  many elected officials here have focused on how they can score  political points to help them win the next election, all at the expense  of the health and security of everyday families.  Arizonans are rightly worried that the dysfunction and chaos they see  coming from Washington could threaten their family's coverage, and that  is unacceptable.  It is time to get partisan politics out of Arizonans' healthcare. I  call on both parties to quit the partisan games, come together, and  stop the sale of junk plans that fail to protect people with  preexisting conditions. We must protect access to healthcare for these  millions of Arizonans and tens of millions of Americans, and we must  make healthcare more affordable for everyday families.  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on "", S.J. Res. 52, "".  I yield the floor.    "
700,Tina Smith,0.9738680124282837,D,smith,smith," Ms. SMITH. Madam President, today I wish to recognize and celebrate  the lives of James Rogers, Charles Nord, and Kort Plantenberg, all  members of the Minnesota National Guard, who tragically lost their  lives in a helicopter accident on Thursday, December 5. After returning  home safely from deployment to the Middle East in May, this loss is  especially heart wrenching. These men conducted medical evacuations in  the Middle East, and their service to our troops and allies will not be  forgotten. I am grateful for their service and sacrifice for Minnesota  and our country.  CW2 James Rogers, often remembered for his curious nature, served 10  years in the Minnesota National Guard, having enlisted before his high  school graduation. CW2 Charles Nord enlisted in 2007, and he leaves  behind his wife, young daughter, and a child on the way. SGT James  Plantenberg enlisted in 2016, was a member of the Guard's biathlon  team, and was preparing to start flight school. We are all indebted to  these men for their service, and I wish their families peace during  this time of tragic loss.    "
701,Tina Smith,0.9738680124282837,D,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for  yielding. I thank Mr. Wilson for his great work, and I want to thank my  distinguished colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Eliot Engel and  Michael McCaul. Thank you for your support in helping to get this  legislation to the floor. I thank Chairman Keating, as well.  Mr. Speaker, I urge swift enactment into law of this bipartisan bill  called the Belarus Democracy Human Rights and Sovereignty Act of 2020,  which I have introduced.  And here is why this legislation is absolutely needed right now; not  next year, not when we come back, hopefully the Senate will take it up  if it passes today, and I think it will, but we need this right now.  Many of my colleagues know, and perhaps they know it well, that  Belarus was perhaps the nation most mired in the Soviet past, with an  inefficient economy and a strongman autocrat, really a dictator, in  charge for over two and a half decades, Alexander Lukashenko. Yet the  indomitable spirit of freedom stirred among the people of Belarus, and  when a patently false election--another one--was announced on August 9  declaring Lukashenko the winner, the people took to the streets. And  they are still on the streets today.  The OSCE Moscow Mechanism reported November 5 that there is  ``'overwhelming' evidence that Belarus' August 9 presidential election  results were falsified and as `systematic' human rights violations have  been committed by the country's security forces in response to the  peaceful demonstrations that the vote sparked.''  Now, reports out of Belarus indicate that police are using  increasingly violent tactics against these peaceful protesters.  The BBC summed it up yesterday in an article titled, ``Belarus  protesters battered, bruised, but defiant after 100 days,'' which said  in part, ``opposition protesters remain defiant in Belarus despite  police brutality, 100 days after they first took to the streets to  denounce the reelection of President Alexander Lukashenko. Police in  helmets and body armour throw women holding flowers and balloons into  police vans.''  And, of course, then it only gets worse. ``Officers tear-gas elderly  people on a pensioners' march. . . .  ``Yet every Sunday thousands still pour into the streets of the  capital Minsk, condemning what they see as Mr. Lukashenko's fraudulent  9 August victory. . . . `'  There is a report that points out, again a BBC report, ``Alesya, a  31-year-old worker in the IT industry, regularly attends the Sunday  rallies. On 15 November, however, things turned nasty very quickly.  ``When she arrived at the square,'' she said, ``where the march was  supposed to start, it was already packed with security forces. As more  people gathered, officers fired stun grenades and started hitting  people with batons to disperse the crowd.  ``They attacked us again and again. It was awful. They ferociously  beat people, twisted their arms and took them away.  ``She ran away into one of the courtyards following other protesters,  but police in their minivans quickly caught up with them even there.  She was saved,'' she goes on, ``by a stranger who hid her and several  others in his house.''  {time} 1530  She goes on to say, ``It was like World War II, when people tried to  hide Jews from the Nazis. It was terrifying, we were shocked.''  That particular march was called in memory of Roman Bondarenko, an  activist who was so severely beaten while in detention, that he died in  the hospital just last week.  Mr. Speaker, the Congress can and we must do our part in this crisis.  The people of Belarus, especially the pro-democracy leaders,  desperately need our help, and they need it right now.  As my colleagues know, the leading opposition presidential candidate,  Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya, almost certainly won the election in August.  She went on to form the Coordination Council.  The democratic opposition is united, it is smart, it is principled,  tenacious, and it is extraordinarily brave.  Ms. Tsikhanouskaya ran a courageous campaign, but today is in exile  in Lithuania, in Vilnius, where she continues to rally the Belarusian  people and the world and demand that democracy and human rights for all  people be given to her nation.  A couple weeks ago I read portions of a transcript of a hearing I  chaired in 2011 after another fraudulent Belarusian election put  Lukashenko back in power. Then as now, and on so many other occasions,  Lukashenko's bullies beat, jailed, assaulted, tortured, raped, and  killed peaceful protesters, but now it is going on right as we meet  here today as never before.  The big mistake of the past, fatigue or lack of commitment and  perseverance by the international community, can't be repeated this  time. We can't be outraged at first and then turn the page and say,  ``Now what?''  We need to have a determined effort to help these people who are  struggling for democracy and human rights in their nation.  On two separate occasions, I would note parenthetically, I met with  Lukashenko in Minsk and came away resolved to accelerate the struggle  for democracy and freedom.  I was with a group of 11 Members, including some of our members on  the committee, and he pointed to me, because I am the author of the  Belarus Democracy Act of 2004, and said, ``There is public enemy number  one.''  That is how he thinks. Anybody who aspires for freedom and democracy,  particularly against his brutal regime, is construed to be a public  enemy. And for the people of Belarus, they go to jail, where they are  beaten senselessly.  Our bipartisan bill, "", H.R. 8438, "", again, cosponsored by Mr. Engel, Mr.  McCaul, Mr. Keating, Mr. Kinzinger, and so many other Members of this  House, updates, strengthens, and expands the Belarus Democracy Acts of  2004, 2006, and 2011, laws that I also authored, and renews the  personal, economic, and visa sanctions on an expanded list of actors in  the Belarusian Government, and now for the first time on Russian  individuals complicit in this crackdown.  I would note parenthetically, the Magnitsky Act, the idea of  personally sanctioning with visa denial as well as economic sanctions  on individuals that led to the Global Magnitsky Act came out of the  Belarus Democracy Act of 2004.  So it is an idea, it is a method of holding those who commit these  abuses personally accountable.  When you sanction an entire nation, that has an impact, but innocent  people do get hurt. This sanctions the individuals who are perpetrators  of these heinous crimes.  Yesterday, Svetlana again called for the sanctions, just yesterday  for the sanctions that are embedded in our bill. So the time to act is  now.  The bill also has other provisions. It does call for new elections.  It recognizes the Coordination Council as a legitimate institution to  participate in a dialogue on a peaceful transition of power. They are  the ones we need to be talking to.  It calls for the release of all political prisoners, and that number  rises by the day.  It supports the aspirations of the people to exercise their religious  freedom. There has been a crackdown there as well.  It authorizes assistance to promote democracy in civil society in  Belarus. On occasions in Minsk, I have met with those individuals. They  are brave beyond words, because they always know somebody is lurking-- the secret police--just waiting to haul them off to prison.  It unequivocally states that it is the policy of the U.S. ``not to  recognize any incorporation of Belarus into a `Union State' with  Russia.'' Russia is using this crisis as a pretext to further manifest  their monopoly of power. They would love--like they did in parts of  Ukraine, South Ossetia, Abkhazia--to just take the whole of Belarus  into their national boundary.  The bill requires the U.S. strategy to promote broadcasting, internet  freedom, and access to information. [["", Page , H5920, ]  In addition, it gives much needed support to the Belarusian media and  to the IT sector.  By passing this bill today followed by, hopefully, swift approval in  the Senate and signature into law by the President, we not only  reiterate, but significantly expand our support and solidarity with the  great people of Belarus. We need to pass this bill and I respectfully  call on our Senate colleagues to pass it as well.    "
702,Tina Smith,0.9738680124282837,D,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of "", H.R. 2477, "", which includes  some legislation to improve Medicare coverage for kidney transplant  recipients.  The Trump administration has made increasing rates of kidney  transplantation a priority. It is more cost-effective than dialysis and  results in a dramatic increase in the quality of life for ESRD  patients. However, these patients must continue taking medication for  the remainder of their life so that they don't reject their organs.  Currently, Medicare will only cover the cost of these drugs for 36  months after a kidney transplant. Patients who do not have health  insurance or lose their insurance coverage have to choose between  paying thousands of dollars a month out of pocket or risk the chance of  rejection of their organs.  If organ rejection does occur, these patients must once again endure  the painful, time-consuming, and expensive dialysis treatments paid for  by the Medicare program. By simply paying for the cost of these drugs  and preventing patients from crashing back into dialysis, the Federal  Government [["", Page , H6999, ] can save hundreds of millions of dollars and improve thousands of  lives.  We should not allow such unnecessary waste and suffering to occur.  These Americans should not have to worry about how they will afford the  cost of the medications that allow them to live a completely normal  life.  Madam Speaker, I thank Representatives Kind and Burgess for their  leadership and for working together on this commonsense bipartisan  bill.  Madam Speaker, I urge the House to pass ', H.R. 2477, '.    "
703,Tina Smith,0.9738680124282837,D,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Steve  Nelson, a corn and soybean farmer from Axtell, Nebraska, on his  retirement as president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau.  The Nebraska Farm Bureau is a leading voice for Nebraska agriculture  producers because of its hardworking members and leaders like Steve,  whose hard work and leadership have made the Third District of Nebraska  the top-producing agriculture district in America.  Steve has served as president through the completion of two farm  bills, ensuring the needs of Nebraska producers are reflected and met  throughout the process--no small task.  I have appreciated Steve's persistence in the face of many challenges  we have faced in Nebraska recently, especially the historic floods,  storms, the irrigation tunnel collapse, and certainly other  uncertainties. Those affected, though, were always able to turn to the  Nebraska Farm Bureau.  I would like to thank Steve for his great work, and I wish him well  as he continues as a farm producer at home and advocating for our  State's farmers and ranchers.    "
704,Tina Smith,0.9738680124282837,D,smith,smith," Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  I rise to strongly urge Members to uphold what we did in this Chamber  just a couple weeks ago and what the Senate did, as well; and that is  we passed an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill, with roughly 80 percent of  the vote in both the Senate and the House.  The legislative branch made it absolutely clear that we support this  piece of legislation, and as the gentleman from Texas just noted, we  support it with very good reason.  It is enormously important to give our troops the support that they  need to carry out the job that we all are asking them to do. That is, I  think, one of our minimum obligations as Members of Congress. And this  bill reflects that.  This bill is the process of a lengthy effort involving Members of  both Chambers, both parties, that have come together and put together  an incredibly strong piece of legislation. That is why it passed so  overwhelmingly just a couple weeks ago. And nothing has changed.  Nothing has changed. The bill is exactly the same and every little bit  as important.  Now, the President has the right to veto it, but I think we, as  Members of [["", Page , H9161, ] the legislative body, have to look at the reason behind that. Was it  because of something in the bill?  Pieces of legislation come through here all the time, and we  occasionally miss something. The President finds out, and we say: Gosh,  I didn't know that. That is not what happened here.  I really want Members to understand the President vetoed this because  of something that isn't in the bill and was never going to be in the  bill, something totally unrelated to national security and something  that we were not going to do in any event.  There is literally no reason to veto this bill for the reasons that  the President did and certainly no reason for us not to uphold what we  did in passing this bill. This is really important that we exercise our  legislative prerogative.  There are all kinds of crucial provisions in this bill, but I will  just point to one, and that is the one that Mr. Thornberry mentioned  earlier, to give you an idea of why it is important that the  legislative branch do its job in exercising oversight of the Department  of Defense in providing national security policy, and that is the cyber  issue.  Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Langevin, chairman of the  subcommittee that deals with this issue, and Ranking Member Stefanik,  they have worked together to really put together an incredible package  to try to better address these very cyber issues that we are now  facing. That is what we do in this legislation, and it is not always  exciting, but it is incredibly important to meet our obligation to our  troops and to the national security of this country.  It is enormously important that we pass this bill. We did it once.  Let's just do it one more time, and then we can all go home for the  year. We can be done, and we can be proud of what we have accomplished.  I urge Members to vote in favor of this bill to do what we did just a  couple weeks ago. Show the country that the legislative branch can  still do its job.  I will close on one note, which we make a lot of times.  {time} 1700  This is the most bipartisan committee in Congress. That is not an  easy thing to achieve. We have a lot of things that we passionately  disagree about in this body, and we should, but on the Armed Services  bill, we manage to come together. It is not always easy, but we get it  done.  I think it is enormously important that we let the country know that  that process hasn't died. We put together a product, a bipartisan,  bicameral product that has gotten an overwhelming number of votes.  Let's show the American public that the legislative process works at  least a little bit better than sometimes they think it does, that we  can get our job done and, in this case, get our job done for the men  and women who put their lives on the line to protect this country. We  owe them nothing less than that.  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees  on the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, I rise in  strong opposition to the Administration's seemingly callous veto of the  William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2021 and proudly announce my intention to vote to override  this reckless veto.  I take this action because I disagree with the President that  preserving monuments and memorials and naming military installations  for the defenders of slavery who took up arms against the United States  to achieve their aims is more important and a higher priority than  providing the funding, resources, and support to the nation's military  and civilian defense person, one of the nation's most respected  institutions and its most diverse and representative.  Other than his pique at being on the short end of what is by his own  account an Electoral College landslide and being routed by seven  million votes in his failed bid for reelection, there is absolutely no  basis for the erstwhile Commander-in-Chief to veto the bipartisan NDAA  and deny our servicemembers a long-overdue pay raise and hazard duty  pay many of whom live in or are from my congressional district.  It is cruel, shameful, and heartless for a Commander-in-Chief to deny  to more than 100,000 federal employees the paid family leave child  care, housing and health protections authorized by the FY2021 NDAA or  to withhold from our veterans the benefits that they need and deserve.  The FY2021 NDAA Conference Report, negotiated under the careful  stewardship of Chairman Adam Smith of Washington and Ranking Member Mac  Thornberry in the House and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman  James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Ranking Member Jack Reed of Rhode Island  is carefully crafted, exemplary legislation reflecting the nation's  sacred commitment to those who willingly risk their lives, fortunes,  and sacred honor to keep our nation safe and preserve, protect, and  defend the Constitution.  The FY21 NDAA provides a long-sought after benefit for tens of  thousands of Vietnam-era veterans who are struggling with certain  health complications after being exposed to Agent Orange while serving  their country.  In addition, the legislation authorizes $8.4 billion in military  construction projects to fortify critical infrastructure and base  realignment and closure clean up, it contains important new tools to  deter adversaries China and Russia from attacking or threatening our  national interests; and mandates reforms to make the Pentagon more  efficient, innovative, and cost-effective.  In the legislation there are significant bipartisan provisions to  strengthen our posture on artificial intelligence and cybersecurity and  to fortify our alliance with NATO and our security relationship with  Israel.  With the passage of the FY2021 NDAA, expectant mothers in the  military could receive free loaner maternity uniforms because the  legislation directs the Department of Defense to conduct a pilot  program to issue maternity uniforms and related items to pregnant  military members on a temporary and as-needed basis.  Madam Speaker, this is important because women make up about 21  percent of the Air Force; 20.2 percent of the Navy; 15.4 percent of the  Army; and 9 percent of the Marine Corps.  Also, the FY2021 NDAA makes needed reforms to prevent sexual assault,  a matter of great importance to the public and my colleagues,  particularly those of us from Texas, where Fort Hood is located and  where Army Specialist Vanessa Guillen was murdered to prevent her from  reporting the sexual harassment and abuse she suffered from her direct  superior in the chain of command.  I am very grateful to Congressman Brown of Maryland, himself a  veteran of the Armed Services, for his leadership in ensuring the NDAA  authorize and approve the renaming of military bases currently named  for persons who took up arms for the Confederacy and against the United  States.  I am very pleased that included in the legislation is my language  directing the consideration be given to distinguished and heroic  African-American and Native American servicemembers in the renaming of  military bases.  Removing the stain of bases and military installations being name for  confederate traitors is an act of profound reconciliation and healing.  For too long African Americans servicemembers have been forced to  tolerate the hidden racism that existed under the guise of the rebel  flag, knowing through oral history the brutality of those who  voluntarily fought for the Confederacy.  The FY2021 NDAA ushers in a new enlightened era where the names of  traitors who took up arms against the United States will have their  names removed from places of honor such as military bases or  installations.  These individuals will not be forgotten; instead they will have a  permanent place in history and their records will be studied and  examined in full by historians and scholars.  Madam Speaker, it is also fitting that FY2021 NDAA directs the  Department of Defense to take concrete actions to recognize and  memorialize the contributions made by African Americans and Native  Americans servicemembers in defense of our nation.  The history of African Americans and Native Americans serving in the  military date back to the colonial period of our nation to the present  day.  In every war waged from the Battle of Lexington to the Battle for  Fallujah, African Americans and Native Americans have honorably  answered the call to duty, and served with great valor and distinction  in America's armed forces.  At decisive moments in our nation's history, the United States  military and its citizens warriors answered the call and were decisive  in the nation's epic battles for freedom and liberty, including:  Revolutionary War (1776-1783); War of 1812 (1812-1814); Mexican- American War (1836); Civil War (1861-1865); Spanish-American War  (1898); World War I (1914-1918); World War II (1941-1945); Korean War  (1950-1953); Vietnam War (1965-1975); Gulf War (1991); and Operations  Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, as well as conflicts in other  theaters of war. [["", Page , H9162, ]  The military was there doing a job no other branch of our nation's  government could do--in the face of overwhelming danger--when the fate  of the American Experiment was on the line.  Our thanks to the military for always answering the call of duty-- whether that call comes in the dead of night or the light of day--we  know that we can count on you.  The names and faces of millions of African Americans who have served  our nation in uniform may fade from memory, but today we have the  opportunity to remember and see them in the faces of the young men and  women who preserved freedom in the world, even at a time when the  blessings of liberty were denied to them at home.  The Jackson Lee provision in the FY2021 NDAA recognizes that there is  no shortage of distinguished veterans, and especially African American  and Native American veterans, who are worthy of the honor of naming a  military facility in their honor.  Let me provide for the record some representative candidates.  UNITED STATES ARMY  General Roscoe Robinson Jr., the first black four-star general in the  Army and 1951 West Point graduate who attended the service academy  before the Army was desegregated and served in Korea and Vietnam, with  valor decorations in both conflicts, and as a training officer as part  of the U.S. military support mission in Liberia. He went on to become  the first black commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, deputy chief  of staff for operations in U.S. Army Europe, commander of U.S. Forces  Japan, the U.S. representative on the NATO Military Committee.  William Harvey Carney was the first African American recipient of the  Congressional Medal of Honor, which he received for his actions on July  18, 1863 at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, while a member of the 54th  Massachusetts Regiment in the Civil War--the state's first all-black  regiment.  The 54th Massachusetts was the subject of the film, ``Glory,''  starring Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman.  Lieutenant Colonel Charity Edna Adams was appointed to lead the  African American Women's Army Corps unit designated as the 6888th  Central Postal Directory Battalion, which became known as the ``Six  Triple Eight.''  The ``Six Triple Eight'' unit was instrumental in establishing and  maintaining morale because it assured that mail from the battlefront  and the home-front flowed efficiently and timely.  Lt. Col. Margaret E. Bailey of the Army Nurse Corps was the first  nurse to be promoted to lieutenant colonel.  UNITED STATES NAVY  Messman First Class Dorie Miller was serving in a noncombat role in  the Navy, when he acted heroically to defend lives after his ship, the  USS West Virginia was attacked at Pearl Harbor.  He was the first African American to be awarded the Navy Cross, the  third highest honor awarded by the United States Navy at the time.  Admiral Michelle Howard is a four-star Admiral and one of the  highest-ranking African American women ever to serve in any branch of  the military. Admiral Howard is also the first African American woman  to command a U.S. naval vessel, the USS Rushmore.  She is the Navy's second highest ranking officer and is currently  serving as the commander of U.S. Naval Forces Africa, commander of U.S.  Naval Forces Europe, and commander of Allied Joint Force Command  Naples.  UNITED STATES AIR FORCE  In 2012, Lieutenant Colonel Shawna Rochelle-Kimbrell became the first  female African American fighter pilot in the Air Force history and her  flights in Northern Watch marked her as the first female pilot to fly  combat missions for Misawa's 35th Fighter Wing and the first African  American woman to employ ordinance in combat. She has logged more than  1,110 hours in the F-16, including 176 hours of combat time.  Colonel Ruth A. Lucas was the first African American woman in the Air  Force to be promoted to the rank of colonel. At the time of her  retirement in 1970, she was the highest-ranking African American woman  in the Air Force.  In 1959 General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. became the first African  American Major General in the United States Air Force. As the organizer  and commander of famed 332nd Fighter Group known as the Tuskegee  Airmen, his place in history will be forever remembered and revered.  General Davis received many decorations during his career, including  two Distinguished Service Medals and a Silver Star and on December 9,  1998, General Davis was awarded his fourth general's star by President  Bill Clinton.  UNITED STATES COAST GUARD  Chief Petty Officer Alex Haley is best known for writing letters for  his shipmates and his short stories and articles, which got him  promoted to Chief Journalist of the Coast Guard in 1959.  Haley ultimately received a number of military honors, including the  American Defense Service Medal, World War II Victory Medal and an  honorary degree from the Coast Guard Academy but most of you know him  also as the author of ``Roots,'' the path-breaking and epic retracing  of a family's history from the Gambian coast in Africa to the New World  in America.  In 1957, Captain Bobby Wilks became the first African American Coast  Guard aviator. He later became the first African American to reach the  rank of Captain and the first to command a Coast Guard air station. He  accumulated over 6,000 flight hours in 18 different types of aircrafts.  Madam Speaker, 25 percent of the today's active duty military is  comprised of persons of color, of which 17.8 percent are African  American.  This percentage outpaces the percentage of African Americans in the  general population (13 percent) but lagging significantly is the 9% of  African Americans in the commissioned officer ranks.  NATIVE AMERICANS  The Jackson Lee Amendment offered during House consideration of the  NDAA was expanded to include Native Americans.  It is without doubt that the military has a storied history of Native  American contributions to the securing our nation since colonial times  to the present.  One famous example of their contributions occurred during World War  II when the U.S. military developed a specific policy to recruit and  train Navajo speakers to become ``code talkers.''  Code Talker is the name given to 29 Navajo Natives who used their  tribal language to send secret communications on the battlefield.  The Marines formed the Navajo Code Talkers, who created a code based  on the complex, unwritten Navajo language.  The code primarily used word association by assigning a Navajo word  to key phrases and military tactics.  This system enabled the Code Talkers to translate three lines of  English in 20 seconds, not 30 minutes as was common with existing  codebreaking machines.  The Code Talkers participated in every major Marine operation in the  Pacific theater, giving the Marines a critical advantage throughout the  war.  During the nearly month-long battle for Iwo Jima, for example, six  Navajo Code Talker Marines successfully transmitted more than 800  messages without error.  Marine leadership noted after the battle that the Code Talkers were  critical to the victory at Iwo Jima.  The Navajo Code was never broken.  Our Native American brothers and sisters are more than worthy to be  so honored by having their names considered for military bases and  installations.  BOOGALOO AND PROUD BOYS  Another Jackson Lee Amendment included in the House version of the  NDAA directed the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress the  extent, if any, of the threat to national security posed by domestic  terrorist groups and organizations motivated by a belief system of  white supremacy, such as extremist groups like the Boogaloo Boys and  the Proud Boys, is reflected in the Conference bill.  The concern is that in the aftermath of a historic national election,  the activity of violence influencers like Boogaloo Boys or Proud Boys  will increase and lead to attacks becoming more frequent.  We have witnessed too many instances of violent extremists searching  for opportunities to sow violence and disrupt democratic processes and  Boogaloo and Proud Boys are targeting constitutionally protected  activity to coopt or to provide cover for attacks.  Jackson Lee Amendment 179 implements a recommendation made by the  Cyberspace Solarium Commission to require the Secretary of Homeland  Security to develop a strategy to implement Domain-based Message  Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) standard across  U.S.-based email providers to increase the security of email,  The security of email has grown in importance as it has become in  many ways the primary way that businesses, consumers, government  communicate.  The Senate bill also addressed this important issue and the language  of the final Conference concurs.  For all these reasons, I urge all Members to join me in voting to  override the President's unwise and ill-considered veto of the William  M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2021.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered.  There was no objection.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Will the House, on  reconsideration, pass the bill, the objections [["", Page , H9163, ] of the President to the contrary notwithstanding?  Under the Constitution, the vote must be by the yeas and nays.  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question  will be postponed.    "

Mr. President, I want to take one other moment just to  also speak and thank everybody that is involved at this point in  getting us to where we are on this very important survival package.  I have never felt this was a COVID stimulus. It is about helping  people survive over the next several months, whether that is making  sure they have a roof over their head and food on the table, can pay  the bills, keep the heat on. In places like North Dakota and places  like Ohio, it is going to get pretty cold this winter. Our small  businesses, our farmers, our schools that need help to be able to  succeed, all the support we need to provide for vaccine distribution  and healthcare, and all of the other areas--this has been a tough  negotiation.  I do want to say, on a couple of points where I have been deeply  involved, I want to thank the Presiding Officer for his support and  help on our nutrition and agriculture pieces. We have come together in  a very important step. It is going to allow more people to get help to  feed their families over the next several months--no small thing.  We have a hunger crisis in our country. We have people who have  donated to the food bank, worked for the food bank, and are now sitting  for hours in cars, waiting to drive up and get a box of food, in the  United States of America.  And so what we are doing as part of this package is going to be  significant to help people be able to purchase food in the grocery  store, as well as to get help in other ways--to help our seniors with  Meals on Wheels, to help our children who aren't able to eat in school  right now, and our college students who don't have the opportunity to  be on campus and get support.  So we have very significant food access and nutrition, very positive  efforts in this legislation. And for our farmers, as well, across the  country, there is significant support, as well as help in our food  chain and supply chain areas, where we have all been concerned as we  have watched those involved in the supply chain lose their markets in  restaurants and so on but not have the support and the capacity to take  that milk or take those other commodities and be able to move them over  and package them differently for consumers to go to the food bank. We  make some headway in supporting that, as well, in this legislation.  So I want to thank my colleagues. This is really the last negotiation  that Senator Roberts and I have led, as he retires this year. And it  has been, as I have said before, a great pleasure to work with him and  to be able to achieve this effort--bipartisan effort.  The one thank-you I just want to give is in a whole other area that  has been a passion of mine that I have been proud to lead with a  colleague from Missouri, Senator Roy Blunt. We have very significant  support, as well, for behavioral health services, mental health,  substance abuse services that are desperately needed and have been  amplified, and the need has been expanded even more because of what has  happened with the coronavirus.  And there is important support in this legislation, as well, and I am  grateful to be involved in pushing that forward as well.  So there is more to talk about. I know we are a little ways away from  that final vote, but I am hopeful that the coalition that was formed-- that all of us working together that brought this together and  negotiated, and my colleagues who initiated this bipartisan effort-- will find that this is a coalition we want to keep going for next year,  because there is so much more that we need to do together, and the  American people expect us to get things done. And this, I hope, is the  first step of many to celebrate ways that we are solving problems and  helping people and moving the country forward.  Thank you, Mr. President.    "
707,Dan Sullivan,2.4179821014404297,R,sullivan,sullivan," Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is that time of week in which I get  to come down to the floor of the U.S. Senate--a great privilege--and  talk about a special person in Alaska, somebody who helps to make my  State the greatest State in the country, in my opinion. We call this  person our Alaskan of the Week. It is one of the best things I get to  do all week. I know that the pages really enjoy it as well because they  get to hear about Alaska and all of the things that are happening.  Before I recognize our special Alaskan, let me tell you a little bit  about what is going on in Alaska right now.  We have had some strange weather in Southcentral Alaska--warm by our  standards--that being wet and windy, with gusts over 100 miles per hour  in some places. In Fairbanks, which is in the interior--I was just up  there last week and am going to talk about that, for it is where our  special Alaskan of the Week is from--it feels a lot more like winter.  It got down to 27 below zero last week, and now it is in the single  digits.  When it comes to Alaska's interior weather, there is some debate as  to what the lowest recordbreaking temperature was in Fairbanks. Some  say it was 66 below zero in 1934, and others say it was in the negative  70 and 70-below-zero territory.  The numbers do matter. Take it from Dr. Hugh ``Bud'' Fate, who is our  Alaskan of the Week--we call him Bud--who, during the time he was  working construction on the North Slope in the early 1950s, once had to  walk a mile for shelter after a tractor he was operating froze up.  ``When I got to the station, they told me the official temperature  was 70 degrees below zero,'' he said. ``I was dressed for it''--Bud is  a tough guy--``but my fingers and my toes were getting cold. I don't  think I could have made another mile,'' Bud said.  Bud, we know you could have. We know you could have.  That is just one of many stories that Bud tells about his 70 years of  living in the great State of Alaska.  So let me talk about Bud Fate--a legend across our State. He just  turned 90 years old last week. He has been a rodeo cowboy, a college  football player, a roughneck, a soldier, a gold miner, a carpenter, a  hunter, a commercial and subsistence fisherman, a dog musher, a bush  pilot, a dentist, a businessman, a State representative, an author, an  artist, an all-around rabble-rouser, and an Alaskan renaissance man  through and through.  But most importantly, he is a dedicated father, grandfather, husband  to his wife, Mary Jane, for 65 years, and a man who has lived his life  in service to his country, his State, and his community--very worthy of  being our Alaskan of the Week.  So Bud Fate was born on December 4, 1929--90 years ago last week--and  raised in Eastern Oregon--Cowtown, he called it. He began riding a  horse when he was just 6 years old, eventually riding on the rodeo  circuit, getting bucked off horses all across the American West.  He went to college at the University of Washington, where he  initially played football. After he got hurt, he enrolled in a drama  class and had dreams, when he made his way to California, to Hollywood,  to work as an actor or as a stuntman in cowboy movies and films.  As it turned out, it wasn't California that called him; it was Alaska  that called him--specifically, a good job in the far north of Alaska, a  place called Umiat, working on oil rigs not too far away from what  would become the biggest oil find ever in North America, the mammoth  field at Prudhoe Bay. Bud was 20 years old, working 12 hours a day, 7  days a week. Even though it was a barren and cold, cold place--this was  in the winter--he fell in love with it. Alaska grabbed him, as it does  to certain types of adventuresome, intelligent, and fiercely  independent individuals.  It grabbed Bud, and it didn't let go--never let go. He was one of the  drillers working on the shift which brought the first oil to the  surface that came out of this rig in Umiat. Bud likes to describe it as  this almost beautiful orange color, some of the first oil in Alaska in  the fifties, early fifties--pretty exciting.  He was working on the slope when, in 1950, a radio message came in  where they were working that the United States was at war in Korea.  Bud said:  I remember thinking it wouldn't affect me way up here on   the North Slope of Alaska. Nobody is going to find me, a 20-  year-old, but 2 weeks later, I got my first draft notice.  That is what Bud said. I guess it goes to show you Uncle Sam can find  you anywhere if he wants you.  As a U.S. Army corporal, Bud was attached to the 11th Airborne  Division when he got deployed not to Korea but actually back to Alaska.  He was charged with riding the lead Jeep to conduct the combat survey  on all the twists and turns of the newly constructed, 1,700-mile-long  Alcan Highway, advising the mission commanders about the Arctic, cold  weather, and Alaska.  A couple of years later, he was out of the Army, back in Alaska, and  he was having a drink one night at the famous Rendezvous Club in  Fairbanks, a tongue-tied veteran, he was, and in walks a Miss Alaska  contestant--or should I say, from Bud's perspective, in walks destiny.  Whom am I talking about? Who was the destiny?  Well, it is Mary Jane Evans, a young, smart--according to Bud-- ``Hollywood beautiful'' Athabaskan woman from the small Yukon River  village of Rampart. She took his breath away. As a matter of fact, she  took everybody's breath away.  Now, Bud, at this event, was wearing moccasins. Mary Jane was wearing  stilettos, and she promptly stepped on his toes, but it was still love  at first sight for both of them, and according to Bud, it still is, 65  years later. For 65 years, they forged a life together, Bud and Mary  Jane, the theme of which centered around public service.  Always working together, they raised three beautiful, kind and keenly  intelligent daughters--keenly intelligent--and they worked to  fundamentally change Alaska for the better, both through institutions  and volunteering at organizations and through individual actions that  profoundly impacted so many Alaskans over the years. [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7023"">Page S7023</a>, ]  Eventually Bud, using the GI bill, went back to college, and then he  went to get his degree in dentistry. He was a beloved dentist not only  in Fairbanks but all across the region.  Now, he was a bush pilot, and he had a plane, so he and Mary Jane,  who was a trained dental assistant, traveled all around the small  villages in the interior.  Trust me, these villages do not and certainly back then did not have  any dental care, so they provided dental care throughout the interior  to tiny, little communities for free, for anybody who needed it.  As their three daughters were growing up--Janine, Jennifer, and  Julie--it was a big time, a momentous time, in Alaska.  The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act was being debated. One of the  biggest land settlements in American or all history took place right  here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.  Bud and Mary Jane were both highly involved in this monumentally  important bill for Alaska and in the overarching efforts to attain  rights and lands for the Alaska Native people.  One of Bud's best friends was Ralph Perdue, a strong Alaska Native  leader, who, along with Mary Jane and Bud, founded the Fairbanks Native  Association. Working together, they focused heavily on education for  Alaska Natives, particularly high school education, something most  Americans take for granted. Until 1970, rural Alaska--a huge swath of  America--by and large did not have any high schools. The small  communities, small villages, did not have any high schools. To get a  high school education, young students and even children had to leave  their homes and their villages and travel to boarding schools in very  faraway places in Alaska and in the lower 48.  Now, that was an injustice--one, among others, that the Fairbanks  Native Association decided to tackle. They produced studies. They gave  lectures. They talked to State officials. They talked to Federal  officials. They and so many others across the State helped lay the  groundwork for the seminal lawsuit brought by a group of Alaskans that  resulted in a State-signed consent decree to provide high schools in  communities throughout the State--communities with at least 15  students--rather than sending their children all across Alaska,  hundreds of miles away, or to the lower 48, thousands of miles away.  At the time, this education settlement was the largest education  settlement in American history, but Bud's commitment to education  didn't stop there--not even close. He was on the Board of Regents for  the University of Alaska, eventually serving as president of the  university. It should be noted that later, Mary Jane, his wife, also  served on this very important board.  With a combined 24 years of service together, Bud and Mary Jane were  on the University of Alaska Board of Regents. Bud helped run the  university when the president abruptly resigned.  He and Mary Jane also opened their home to villagers all across the  State who came to Fairbanks and just needed a place to stay. They knew  that Bud and Mary Jane would take them in. ``Our house was always  full,'' their lovely daughter Julie said.  There were always people living with us who were empowering   themselves through education. To this day, I still have   Alaskans stop to tell me how they were helped and given a   second chance by my parents.  As Julie also noted, there was always a huge amount of smoked salmon  strips on the table for all to share--the best smoked salmon in Alaska,  I might add.  There is so much more to Bud Fate's life. For instance, at the young,  tender age of 70, he decided he was going to run for office. He ran for  the State legislature, and he won in a landslide. He served two terms.  He was immediately elected chairman of the Natural Resources Committee,  which is a huge, important committee in Alaska, and was highly  respected on both sides of the aisle.  The list of boards and commissions that he sat on is way too long to  go into here, as is the list of service organizations he has  volunteered for and led.  He has known Presidents of countries and dignitaries from all over  the globe. He is as comfortable at his fish camp on the Yukon River as  he is in the board room.  As I mentioned, he is a rabble rouser with very strong opinions--I  have heard them for many years, but at heart all of his opinions are  focused on a commitment to treat everybody with respect and kindness  and provide every Alaskan--every American--an opportunity to better  themselves.  He is a good man--Bud Fate--one of the best. The measure of Bud and  the impact of his life is probably best reflected in his family and his  friends, so many of whom gathered in Fairbanks on December 4 for his  90th birthday, where people from all walks of life all across the State  came together--well over 100--talked about his generosity, how it  impacted them, how it impacted families, and how it impacted people all  around him.  People gave speeches about how he and Mary Jane took in people from  all walks of life--veterans coming back from Vietnam who needed comfort  and respect, people who needed a helping hand, food, warmth, just love.  He lifted people up, so did Mary Jane, and they saved lives.  I was actually one of those people giving a speech in Fairbanks at  Bud's 90th birthday party, and I talked about the profound impact Bud  has had on my own life--after all, Bud Fate is my father-in-law, and I  can't imagine a better one.  He has taught me so much. Bud and Mary Jane, along with my own mom  and dad, have provided me a model--actually, for me and Julie, my wife,  of what a true partnership looks like. He is a model for how fulfilling  a life of service can be, especially a life in the great State of  Alaska.  As I mentioned, he is not just a model for me but for the whole State  of a life well lived and a life lived in full.  So, Bud, thanks for all you have done for Alaska, for America, for  Fairbanks, for our family, for our great State, and all you continue to  do. Thanks for being a great father-in-law and a friend, and, Bud,  congratulations on being our Alaskan of the Week.  I yield the floor.    "
708,Jon Tester,1.7731460332870483,D,tester,tester," Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, we have had a fruitful day here today. We  passed a lot of bills. We did it in a bipartisan way. I want to thank  both Leader McConnell and Leader Schumer for their good work, as well  as Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Leahy for their good work on  these bills.  Today, I am going to do something that I have never done before. I am  going to read an obituary about a man I don't believe I have ever met,  even though I was in the Veterans' Home of Columbia Falls while he was  there. This obituary was passed on to me by my wife, who got it from a  friend. It is incredibly powerful because, quite frankly, it is about  one man, but it is actually about a generation of men and women who  served in Vietnam.  This guy's name was William Ebeltoft. The obituary goes like this:  ``Not everyone who lost his life in Vietnam died there.''   The saying is true for CW2 William C. Ebeltoft. He died on   December 15, 2019 at the Veteran's Home in Columbia Falls,   Montana. He died 50 years after he lost, in Vietnam, all that   underpinned his life. He was 73 years old.  Everyone called him ``Bill.'' He was loved by the nursing   staff who cared for him. He was loved by the fellow veterans   with whom he lived; those he helped when he was able and   entertained with funny German slang and a stint at the piano   when he could. He was a virtuoso when playing ``Waltzing   Matilda.''  His small family loved him dearly. He was preceded in death   by his parents, Paul and Mary Ebeltoft of Dickinson, North   Dakota, whose devotion and care for their war-damaged boy was   strong and unfailing. He is survived by his brother, Paul   Ebeltoft, and the one he loved as the sister he never had,   Paul's wife, Gail. . . . It is difficult to write about Bill.   He lived three lives: before, during and after Vietnam.   Before Vietnam, Bill was a handsome man, who wore clothing   well; a man with white, straight teeth that showed in his   ready smile. A state champion trap shooter, a low handicap   golfer, a 218-average bowler, a man of quick, earthy wit,   with a fondness for children, old men, hunting, fast cars,   and a cold Schlitz. He told jokes well.  During Vietnam, he lived with horrors of which he would   only seldom speak. Slow Motion Four, Bill's personal call   sign, logged thousands of helicopter flight hours performing   Forward Support Base resupply landings, medical evacuations,   exfils and gun ship runs. We know of him there mostly through   medals for valor he received, and these were many. . . .   While attempting to resupply B Company, [Warrant Officer]   Ebeltoft's co-pilot became wounded. Realizing the importance   of the mission WO Ebeltoft elected to attempt completion of   the mission. Due to his superior knowledge of the aircraft,   the helicopter was kept under control during the period in   which the pilot was wounded and the ship was under fire.   Remaining under attack from automatic weapons fire, the   supply mission was successfully completed. While unloading   the supplies, WO Ebeltoft received word that there were five   emergency medical evacuation cases located 200 meters to his   rear. WO Ebeltoft re-positioned his helicopter and picked up   the wounded personnel. While evacuating the wounded, the   commanding officer of Company B was injured. WO Ebeltoft   again maneuvered his aircraft to enable evacuation of the   injured officer. WO Ebeltoft then proceeded to evacuate all   injured personnel by the fastest possible means. Upon   completion, examination of the aircraft revealed that the   aircraft had sustained nine enemy .30 caliber hits.  Bill got the medal, of course, but he would have been the   last to say anything about it. The citation shows the type of   man that he, and many of his brothers-in-arms in Vietnam   were; and still are today, albeit battered hard and unfairly   by the cruel winds of the time in which they fought.  After being discharged as a decorated hero, Bill had a   rough re-entry into civilian life. It is not necessary to   recount Bill's portion of what is an all-too-common story for   wartime veterans, particularly those of the Vietnam era. It   may be sufficient to say that after a run at business, a   marriage and while grappling daily with his demons, his   mental faculties escaped him. Bill became a resident of the   Veteran's Home in Columbia Falls, Montana in 1994. He lived   there for the next 26 years.  At the Home, the patina of his memory covered life's   sorrows, and it was a blessing. Bill was happy there, living   a life that was a strange mixture of hunting stories, pickup   trucks and memories of some of his better times with women,   friends and the outdoor life. Bill denied that anyone he   loved had died; could not understand why anyone would fill   with gas at four bucks a gallon when ``Johnny's Standard   sells it for 27 cents;'' and still ``drove'' his 1968 Dodge   Charger. He was unfailingly courteous. His largest concerns   were making his smoke breaks and finding his wallet (a search   of 26 years.)  In the past year, Bill's shaky grip on physical health also   slipped through his fingers. Yet, despite this, what we loved   in him remained, if only sometimes as a shadow. Even after   his serious decline, suffering fractures because of falls,   Bill would tell the staff that he was ``just fine'' and not   to worry about him. Thin, hunched over, propelling himself   with one foot, he would wheel himself into the room of a bed-  ridden veteran and sit there, next to the bed, unspeaking.   The nursing staff was certain that Bill thought that the man   in bed was lonely and needed company.  Bill was always a proud man, remembering himself as he was   in 1969, not as he became. Who are we to suggest differently?   His was not a life that many would wish for, but in some   ways, Bill was a lucky man. He was surrounded to the end by   staff who enjoyed and respected him. He had a chance to be   helpful to others who were doing less well than he. And the   passing of the seasons never diminished his plans for another   elk hunt or to ``see that beautiful girl again this   weekend.''  When a small slice of reality penetrated his pleasant   confusion, Bill struggled to understand why he was where he   was. Prematurely aged, his worldly goods in a small dresser,   not knowing who the President might be or remembering why he   should care, Bill's losses were greater than most of us could   endure. Yet, to those who love him, his brother and his   brother's wife, and their sons, he will always be a brave,   accomplished man, more generous than was wise, more trusting   than was safe.  It is not possible to wrap your arms around a loved one who   leaves. But it is possible to wrap your heart around a   memory. Bill's will be well taken care of.  I yield the floor.    "
709,John Thune,0.949413001537323,R,thune,thune," Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in 1906, two brothers named Nikolai and  Matthew Gjelsvik arrived at Ellis Island from Norway. The only English  they knew were the words ``apple pie'' and ``coffee,'' which evidently  they learned on the boat on the way over.  The immigration officials at Ellis Island thought that their name  would be too difficult to spell and pronounce in this country, so they  asked them to change their name. The names, when they got to this  country, were Nikolai Gjelsvik, spelled G-J-E-L-S-V-I-K, and his  brother was named Matthew.  So the immigration officials asked them to change their name, and  they picked the name from the farm where they worked near Bergen,  Norway, which was called the Thune farm. So Nikolai Gjelsvik became  Nick Thune, my grandfather.  He and his brother worked on the railroad as they built it west  across South Dakota. They learned English and saved up enough money to  start a small merchandising company and then later a hardware store in  Mitchell, SD. To this day, there is a Thune Hardware in Mitchell,  although the family sold it many years ago.  In 1916, Nick Thune married an Iowa girl who had moved to South  Dakota to teach school, and they had three sons. The middle son,  Harold, will turn 100 in a few days, and that middle son happens to be  my dad.  Like many of my colleagues, I send congratulatory notes to  constituents for big birthdays and anniversaries. I never thought I  would have the occasion to send one to my dad. I figured for this one,  instead of writing a letter, I would come to the floor.  My dad is a World War II veteran. He is a member of that ``greatest  generation,'' and he shares the qualities of so many in that  generation--humility, patriotism, quiet service. Dad was a Navy pilot  who flew Hellcats off the USS Intrepid, and he was an excellent pilot.  He received the Distinguished Flying Cross for shooting down four enemy  planes in one engagement. As a side note to that, that accommodation  was issued to him by none other than ADM John McCain, Senator John  McCain's grandfather.  But my dad didn't and still doesn't talk about his own exploits. In  fact, had it not been for my mom, I am quite sure I never would have  known about my dad's record in World War II. I did have the opportunity  to interview him for the Library of Congress's Veterans History Project  a few years back, and he shared some wonderful details about his  service. As usual, his focus was never on his own achievements but on  those of his fellow pilots.  I also probably would never have learned what an outstanding athlete  my dad was, had it not been for my mom. My dad grew up in the small  town of Murdo, SD, during the Great Depression. They didn't have a lot,  but there were a lot of basketball hoops around Murdo. They put them on  barns, poles, garages, and my dad learned to play. In fact, he learned  to play so well that he took his high school basketball team to the  State championship game where, although they lost narrowly, he was  named the tournament's most valuable player.  My dad had hoped to attend college in South Dakota, but there was a  doctor in Murdo named Joseph Murphy who thought my dad was good enough  to play at the University of Minnesota and used his contacts to get my  dad up to Hibbing Junior College in hopes that the Minnesota Gophers  would notice him. Well, they did. He went to the Twin Cities on a  scholarship and played three seasons for the Gophers. He was the team's  most valuable player in his junior year. In fact, he was high point man  in Madison Square Garden on his birthday, December 28, 1940.  In another example of how things have changed through the years, my  dad said that when his team came out to play for the second game that  night at the Garden, you couldn't see the upper deck because of all the  cigarette smoke. Some things do change for the better.  While at the University of Minnesota, my dad met a girl who served  sodas at a drugstore just off campus. They were married within a couple  of years while my dad was in flight training for the Navy, and they  spent the next almost 69 years together.  After the war, they came back to South Dakota. My dad had been  thinking about a career in the Navy, but his dad asked him to come back  and run the family hardware store. My dad said that his heart sank, but  he knew that is what he had to do. So he went home and went to work for  his dad. The hardware store did OK for a while, but started to  struggle. My dad sold it and went back to school and got a teaching  degree.  All parents are teachers for their kids, but my parents were teachers  several times over. Kids usually get a break from their parents when  they are at school. My dad was a teacher at my high school. He was also  a coach and the athletic director, and he drove the bus. My mom was the  school librarian. So I think it is safe to say that my brothers and  sister and I were pretty much always under the watchful eye of my  parents. I have to say that I never had my dad for a class in high  school, but my brother Rich did. Rich was the valedictorian of his high  school class, and the only B he got in high school was from my dad.  That was my dad for you. He never showed any preference or gave any of  his kids better treatment than anybody else. In fact, some of us might  argue that he gave us a harder time because we were his kids. But he  believed very firmly that you had to earn your achievements.  As a coach, my dad taught us about being a team player. He made it  clear that being on a team was not about building your personal  statistics but about making the players around you better. It is a  lesson I have carried throughout my life and one that I try to live by  every day.  A few years ago, the Jones County School District in Murdo named the  auditorium in Murdo after my dad in recognition of his service and  achievements at the school. It was particularly special since my dad  was one of the volunteers who originally built the auditorium back in  the 1950s. My dad would tell me the story that he was more scared up on  the scaffolding of that building than he had ever been flying off a  carrier during World War II.  You might think that with my dad as coach and athletic director,  sports were the main focus around our house. They certainly were a big  part of our lives. But my mom was determined that we would grow up to  be well-rounded people, and my dad always supported her in that. They  worked hard to ensure that we grew up with a perspective on life that  went beyond just the latest sporting event. Mom made us take piano  lessons and, during the summers, come in from outside and read for an  hour every day. We complained at the time, but I know all of us today  are grateful to her and my father for their investments in that.  Mom and Dad made a good team. Mom was an optimist, and Dad was a  pessimist--or, as he would put it, a realist--and they balanced each  other out well. We didn't have material riches growing up, but we were  beyond rich in those things that money can't buy but that lend purpose,  joy, and meaning to life. All of us Thune kids are very, very grateful  for that heritage.  I can't close without talking about something that was life-changing  for my parents, and that was their strong faith in Christ. My dad  always had real discernment and wisdom in no small part because of his  daily dependence upon God in his life. God blessed him with it. [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7223"">Page S7223</a>, ]  As we celebrate my dad's 100th birthday, I want to say thank you to  you for the example of faith, integrity, character, and humility that  you have given to me and to Bob and to Rich and to Karen and to Tim.  Thank you for faithfully serving God's purpose for your generation and  happy 100th birthday.  I yield the floor.    "
710,Thom Tillis,0.7373980283737183,R,tillis,tillis," Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Lt. Col. Allen Lamb, a retired Air Force pilot from the great State of North Carolina, for his many years of service to his country as a combat pilot and the important role he played in the development of U.S. Air Force tactics. Lt. Col. Allen Lamb selflessly dedicated 20 years of his life to serving his country in the United States Air Force. During his service, he saw combat during both the Korean war and Vietnam war, while piloting a variety of aircraing from propeller-driven heavy bombers to the most advanced jet fighters of the era. Lieutenant Colonel Lamb had an uncanny ability of surviving the mid-air accidents that occurred on a few of the many combat and training missions that he participated in, and he is notable for successfully ejecting from four-engine, three- engine, and two-engine airplanes at different points during his career. From protecting his B-26 bomber as a tail gunner from Soviet MIG pilots over Korea, to being distinguished as the first American pilot to successfully destroy North Vietnamese surface to air missile--SAM-- sites in an F-100 Super Sabre fighter jet, Lieutenant Colonel Lamb's Cold War service consisted of many hazardous and diverse assignments. Although it is difficult to narrow all of the spectacular and death- defying accomplishments of Lieutenant Colonel Lamb's career down to one specific achievement, his participation in the first ``Wild Weasel'' strike against a North Vietnamese SA-2 SAM site is particularly notable for the significant influence it had on future Air Force tactics. In 1965, early in the Vietnam War, the U.S. Air Force was losing a considerable number of planes during the strategic bombing campaign in North Vietnam due to the effectiveness of deadly Soviet-supplied SA-2 SAMs that were strategically scattered throughout the country. As a result, the Air Force developed a daring solution to counter the SAM threat that involved using agile F-100 Super Sabre and F-4 Phantom fighter jets to detect and suppress the missile launching sites. The innovative Air Force mission'' was soon given the name ``Wild Weasel'' because the anti-SAM mission was reminiscent of the way a hunting ferret enters the den of its prey to kill it. In late 1965, Lieutenant Colonel Lamb was given command of leading the first Wild Weasel mission, Wild Weasel I. On this mission, which took place just over 50 kilometers from the North Vietnamese capital Hanoi, Lieutenant Colonel Lamb and his navigator Jack Donovan flew extremely low on multiple strafing runs and were successful in destroying a SA-2 SAM site that was not previously known to exist. Both men were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross by the Air Force for their efforts. Lieutenant Colonel Lamb respectfully declined receiving the Silver Star award when he was offered it because his crewman Jack Donovan was not also included. Wild Weasel I demonstrated that the Wild Weasel project was an effective method of identifying and eliminating enemy SAM capabilities, and it was essential in saving the lives of American bomber pilots as they continued to conduct missions over North Vietnam until 1973. Lieutenant Colonel Lamb completed the first, second, and third Wild Weasel kills during the war, and the tactics he was instrumental in developing during the Wild Weasel missions are still utilized in modern Air Force operations to suppress enemy air defenses. As a U.S. Senator, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and a North Carolinian, I am pleased to recognize and honor Lt. Col. Allen Lamb for his impressive career of military service, his critical role in the development of U.S. Air Force tactics, and his steadfast commitment to our country.<bullet>   "

712,Tom Udall,1.4404200315475464,D,udall,udall," Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, Werner Gellert survived the Holocaust and never forgot that terrible injustice. Werner went on to found a museum in Albuquerque dedicated not only to educating people about the Holocaust but dedicated to stopping intolerance wherever it is found. Werner Gellert was born on June 14, 1926 in Breslau, Germany. During November 9 and 10, 1938, Nazi paramilitary forces carried out a pogrom throughout Germany demolishing and ransacking Jewish homes, businesses, synagogues, schools, and hospitals. At that time, 267 synagogues in Germany and surrounding areas and 7,000 Jewish businesses were destroyed and over 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and incarcerated in concentration camps. That pogrom was called Night of the Broken Glass, or Kristallnacht, meaning ``Crystal Night,'' because of all the broken glass scattered throughout the streets from the shattered windows of Jewish buildings. After the Night of the Broken Glass, Werner and his adopted parents fled Germany for Shanghai, one of the only places in the world at that time that accepted Jews unconditionally. However, the Japanese who were occupying Shanghai became allied with the Germans, and, on February 18, 1943, they issued a proclamation establishing a restricted area where ``stateless refugees'' must live and work. Werner and his family were relocated to this restricted area, Hongkew, which became plagued with disease and starvation. On one of his birthdays, Werner asked only for a loaf of bread and jar of jam for himself, but he didn't get his wish. During this period, he suffered through starvation, typhus, yellow fever, and hepatitis, and he was brutalized by a bully and permanently lost most of the sight in one of his eyes. After the end of World War II, Werner remained in Shanghai, working as a typewriter repairman for the U.S. Army. The Army recognized his intelligence and linguistic skills--he spoke seven languages--and recruited him into Army intelligence as a civilian consultant. He worked undercover for the United States in China, Tibet, and the Philippines. The Chinese Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and early 1970s drove out Werner and his family, and they fortunately were able to escape on the last boat out of Shanghai to the United States. They relocated to Denver, where Werner attended Denver University and met his future wife, Frances Silverman--known as ``Frankie''--to whom he was married for 54 years, until her passing in 2007. After a successful career in the savings and loan business in California, Werner and Frankie retired to Albuquerque. Werner fervently believed that education was the most effective weapon against hate and intolerance. With that guiding principal in mind, in 2001, he and Frankie founded the Albuquerque Holocaust and Intolerance Museum. The museum is dedicated to educating the public through its exhibitions on the horrors and injustices of hate--from the Holocaust, to the African-American experience here in the United States to genocide of minority peoples around the world. Its goal is to promote ``upstanders,'' not bystanders: people who speak out and act to support individuals, groups, or causes attacked or bullied. The museum is home to the Library of Remembrance, a compilation of more than 4,500 books, documents, and videos about the injustice of genocide, bullying, and intolerance. As long as he was able, well into his eighties, Werner spoke to school groups at the museum and around the State teaching them about his experience during the Holocaust and as a refugee in Shanghai. Werner took his own terrible experience and set about to make a better, more understanding, more tolerant world for others. While we lost Werner on November 9, 2019, at age 93, [[<a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7206"">Page S7206</a>]] his commitment to ending genocide, intolerance, and bullying will live on through the Albuquerque Holocaust and Intolerance Museum.<bullet>   "
713,Mark Warner,0.3398280143737793,D,warner,warner," Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to a group  of veterans who served this country decades ago but who continue to  suffer to this day as a result of their service. I am talking about  hundreds of thousands of veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange  during their service.  From 1962 to 1975, the United States sprayed over 20 million gallons  of Agent Orange across Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Millions of our  servicemembers, not to mention millions of Vietnamese civilians, were  exposed. Fifty years later, hundreds of thousands of Vietnam-era  veterans are still paying the price.  From the start, the Federal Government has tried to slow-walk  attempts to cover the care these veterans earned. It wasn't until 1991  that the VA recognized the connection between Agent Orange exposure and  several diseases and conditions, finally allowing these veterans to  seek treatment from the VA. Currently, the list of conditions at the VA  stands at 14, but science tells us the list is far from complete.  In 2017, then-Veterans Affairs Secretary Shulkin called for three  more conditions to be added to the list: bladder cancer, underactive  thyroid, and Parkinson's-like symptoms. Now, these weren't randomly  chosen. They were conditions found by the National Academy of Science  to be connected to Agent Orange exposure.  The science was there. The VA was there. Yet this White House and its  OMB Director, Mick Mulvaney, have blocked this effort to expand the  list of conditions.  Do you know what the deciding factor was? It wasn't scientific  evidence. It wasn't the advice of VA doctors. No, the White House  decided that the cost of providing care to 83,000 veterans suffering  from these conditions was just too high, and for that this  administration turned its back on 83,000 veterans who answered the call  to serve.  Unfortunately, this is just the latest example of the Federal  Government trying to avoid paying for the care of men and women our  Nation sent to war. My office hears regularly from veterans facing  problems like prostate cancer, Parkinson's, and other conditions that  have been linked to Agent Orange. Time and again, we hear how the VA  tries to deny benefits on the basis of a technicality. This is just not  right. Unfortunately, this administration is far from the first to  ignore evidence about Agent Orange in order to save a few bucks.  I want to share a few stories from my State of Virginia, where more  than 204,000 Vietnam veterans currently call home. In many cases,  veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange have been fighting multiple  administrations to get these life-or-death benefits--benefits they  earned by their service decades ago.  One veteran, William Badgett of Hampton, VA, was exposed to Agent  Orange during his service in Vietnam with the Army. He was in the 101st  Airborne, 1st Cavalry, where he served as a helicopter mechanic and  supply sergeant. He has been diagnosed with a number of health  conditions, including enlarged prostate, osteoporosis, kidney disease,  and hardened arteries, none of which are on the VA's presumptive list.  While the VA considers prostate cancer to be on the list, Mr.  Badgett's enlarged prostate is not presumed by the VA to be connected  to his exposure to Agent Orange simply because it is not cancer.  Another example: Sam Harvey from Newport News, VA, was exposed to  Agent Orange during the Vietnam war. He served in the U.S. Navy from  1966 to 1970 aboard the USS Constellation. He was diagnosed with  aggressive prostate cancer. Yet, with prostate cancer being on the  presumptive list, he struggled to get VA approval for the treatment he  needs.  Finally, I want to talk about Dorman Watts from North Chesterfield,  VA. He suffered for years to get the disability rating from the VA that  will qualify him for the comprehensive care from the VA. He has  prostate cancer and heart disease and is currently undergoing radiation  treatment from a private provider. This is unacceptable.  That is why I am glad Congress included important accountability  measures as part of the Defense appropriations legislation we passed  this week. Finally, after years of reluctance, years of ignoring the  science, these veterans are going to get some of the answers about the  conditions that have resulted from their service.  There is more than enough evidence to expand the list of Agent  Orange-related conditions. We should be thanking these veterans for  their service, not nickel-and-diming them. I urge my colleagues to  listen to the veterans in their States, and I urge the White House to  let the VA provide these veterans with the benefits they have earned.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    "
714,Elizabeth Warren,0.7253569960594177,D,warren,warren," Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    "
715,Sheldon Whitehouse,0.6481670141220093,D,whitehouse,whitehouse," Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, we are rapidly running out of time  to protect our future and that of our children and grandchildren from  worsening climate upheaval. America ought to be taking every measure  available to rein in greenhouse gas emissions from legislative action  to legal action, to diplomatic action, to regulatory action, which is  going to be a theme of this talk tonight. We are not doing those  things, and, frankly, it is because of corruption, plain and simple.  Regulatory action, that means enforcing the laws on the books. We  have a Clean Air Act that requires the Environmental Protection Agency  to stop dangerous pollutants from fouling our air. The EPA has found  that greenhouse gases are pollutants under the Clean Air Act, and the  Supreme Court has upheld that finding. That means we ought to be  regulating methane. Methane is among the most potent of greenhouse  gases. When released into the atmosphere, it traps about 30 times more  heat than its chemical cousin, carbon dioxide. Oil and gas extraction  releases massive methane pollution. In fact, a growing body of research  suggests methane pollution from natural gas extraction may completely  offset the climate gains of switching from coal to natural gas.  To fulfill its duties under the Clean Air Act, as a matter of law,  EPA needs to prevent methane pollution. It is the law; it is not  optional. But the corrupt Trump EPA won't fight methane pollution. This  corrupt EPA is run by the fossil fuel industry, which could not care  less about methane emissions.  Within weeks of Scott Pruitt taking control of the Agency, the  corrupted EPA withdrew its request that oil and gas companies even  report methane emissions. The industry knew a true report on methane  leakage would damage their case for natural gas as a less dangerous air  pollutant, so they went to a line of attack, taken directly from the  Big Tobacco playbook: Silence the science. The fewer facts the EPA has,  the less action it needs to take under law--the corrupt Trump EPA  deliberately made itself ignorant and stopped the reporting so it could  avoid its duty.  Step 2 came in March 2017 with the corrupt Trump effort to roll back  existing greenhouse gas regulations, including methane regulations.  Trump's Executive order reads like a fossil fuel lobbyist's dream,  probably because fossil fuel lobbyists wrote it. He called on the EPA  to ``review existing regulations that potentially burden the  development or use of domestically produced energy resources and  appropriately suspend, revise, or rescind those that unduly burden the  development of domestic energy resources.''  Regulations to limit methane pollution were among those that Trump's  Executive order singled out, saying, ``As soon as practical, suspend,  revise, or rescind [them].''  Step 3 was to write a do-nothing replacement. After lots of dawdling,  Trump's corrupt EPA decided to draft a fake rule, a rule they could  point to if challenged in court for doing nothing, but a rule that  would conveniently do nothing to limit methane emissions. The fake rule  exempts a huge chunk of oil and gas production from regulation, leaving  the industry with an effective blank check to pollute as much methane  as it likes.  As I speak, the corrupt Trump EPA is preparing to issue its final  rule, and the corrupted fossil fuel industry is poised to grab  everything it wanted. The final rule is one that industry stooges could  have written themselves because, well, it looks like they did write it  themselves. They bought that privilege the old-fashioned way, by buying  it.  Even before Trump took office, the fossil fuel industry began  showering him with money. Trump raised a record amount for his  inauguration--nearly doubling the previous record--and Hess, Chevron,  BP, Citgo, ExxonMobil, Consol Energy, Continental Resources, Murray  Energy, and Valero all made six- or seven-figure donations. The oil and  gas and mining sector was the second largest source of donations,  providing more than $10 million to Trump's inaugural committee. That  money still flows as the 2020 election ramps up.  Fossil fuel companies are among the largest donors to the political  group supporting Trump's reelection. A pipeline company is the largest  single donor to the Trump victory political action committee, more than  $700,000 as of this November. The oil, gas, and mining industries  account for more than $5 million to the Trump Victory PAC.  Fossil fuel executives are some of the largest individual donors to  the Trump Victory PAC. One executive alone gave $360,000. These known  donations likely represent the tip of a big dark iceberg. Dark-money  political organizations accept unlimited donations and provide no  disclosure, and Super PACs accept unlimited donations with little  disclosure. So the bottom line is we cannot tell exactly how much  fossil fuel money is flowing to groups supporting Trump, but it is a  lot. When you consider the $650 billion annual subsidiary the fossil  fuel polluters enjoy, they have every reason to buy control over  government from a corrupt Trump administration.  Money isn't the only way the fossil fuel industry exerts control.  Oklahoma oil king and Scott Pruitt patron Harold Hamm set up a Trump  leadership council to advise Trump. The fossil fuel industry was the  heart of the council, with coal giants Alliance Resource Partners and  Murray Energy, oil services company Baker Hughes, and natural gas  company Devon Energy all active members. Of course, there was the  National Association of Manufacturers, a trade association recently  identified as America's worst climate obstructer.  With all these obstructers and polluters on board, the fossil fuel  friendly [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7122"">Page S7122</a>, ] council fed Trump a steady diet of talking points about slashing  regulations and achieving ``complete American energy independence.''  These fossil fuel industry talking points became the Executive order  I mentioned earlier, an order to kill any environmental protection that  ``unduly burdens the development of domestic energy resources.'' Do you  want to know who the winners were from that Executive order? Check the  list of attendees at the signing ceremony: fossil fuel executives and  fossil fuel industry trade association executives, come to celebrate  the freedom to pollute that their influence and money had bought them.  Chevron has recently been identified as one of the companies that has  done the most to damage our oceans. They are one of the top ocean- wrecking companies on the planet. In February of 2017, Chevron wrote to  the corrupt Pruitt with a list of deregulatory proposals the company  wanted to see implemented at the EPA. Included was a request to  ``refocus methane regulations, particularly those that impact existing  sources, to encourage voluntary approaches.'' For sure, you can trust  one of the world's worst ocean polluters with voluntary approaches.  The corrupt Trump EPA was stocked with fossil fuel industry cronies  ready to implement whatever the industry wanted. Pruitt rose to  political power on a wave of fossil fuel money and demonstrated a  willingness to sell his office by putting fossil fuel industry asks  verbatim onto his official letterhead.  Andrew Wheeler, Pruitt's successor as Administrator, had been a  leading lobbyist for the coal industry. The head of the EPA Air Office,  Bill Wehrum, rose to prominence by helping build and run an array of  trade associations and front groups for--guess what--the fossil fuel  industry.  Beyond Pruitt and Wheeler and Wehrum, the EPA's political leadership  crawled with fossil fuel flunkies, like the one who left to set up the  fossil-fuel dark energy group Energy 45 to help promote fossil fuel  energy policies; or the lawyer-lobbyist for energy interests Dominion  Energy, Koch Industries, and TransCanada overseeing Air Office  compliance, of all things. It has been an infestation.  It is easy for the fossil fuel industry to spend big money to corrupt  the EPA because the corruption payback is so big; the dirty methane  work alone is estimated to save oil and gas companies hundreds of  millions of dollars.  Meanwhile, the American Petroleum Institute, the largest trade  association for the oil and gas industry, announced a new seven-figure  ad campaign called ``We're on it.'' ``We're on it.'' These ads--on the  Internet, TV, and billboards--they are all over the Washington, DC,  airport. They are designed to fool the public and to fool policymakers  that the oil industry is ``on its'' methane emissions problem. Of  course, they are not. Of course, they are lying. It is what they do.  Science tells us that methane emissions are far higher than the  estimates out of the corrupt Trump EPA. The investigative journalism  group Unearthed found that leading oil companies are emitting  unprecedented methane pollution. In just three producing basins, in  just 1 year, oil companies emitted methane equivalent to the annual  emissions of 10 coal-fired power plants or 8 million cars.  There is a recent New York Times article that you can link to showing  infrared imagery--it is really impressive to see, actually, if you  click through to it--infrared imagery of methane billowing out of what  they call super-emitter fossil fuel facilities.  A recent article described one methane blowout in Ohio leaking as  much ``methane than the entire oil and gas industries of many nations  do in a year.''  ``We are on it.'' Yeah, they are ``on it.'' What they are on is a  binge of lying about emissions, corrupting our politics, and blocking  climate action. These massive polluting industries have a long track  record of climate denial and deceit. It is how they roll.  A top climate obstructer, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, pays for a  phony study, claiming the Paris agreement would cost jobs and economic  growth, and Trump pulls out a pass. Oil companies lobby to gut auto  fuel efficiency standards, and Pruitt and Wheeler gut the standards.  The natural gas industry objects to rules limiting methane emission.  The corrupt Trump EPA rolls them back.  Just now, on the Senate floor, we are looking at a tax extenders  package that wipes out the tax extenders for solar going forward, wind  going forward. They gave us 1 year looking backwards. Great, thanks a  bunch. Electric vehicles, storage, and batteries, all of that had been  in a tentative agreement. The fossil fuel industry and the Trump  administration kiboshed all of it. ``On it,'' indeed.  Will Attorney General Barr look into any of this? Of course not. In  the corrupt Trump administration, fossil fuel money and influence puts  that industry above the law. They can pollute and corrupt more or less  at will. We cannot afford this self-dealing from polluters any longer.  This is flat-out wrong. Indeed, it is flat-out crooked. It is not only  time to wake up, Madam President, it is time to clean up. This behavior  is a disgrace.  I yield the floor.    "
716,Roger Wicker,3.558171033859253,R,wicker,wicker," Mr. WICKER. Madam President, the Senator, my good friend from Utah,  has asked unanimous consent that we pass the version of the bill I  authored. Ordinarily, I would very much appreciate that. The problem  with his request is that in this Congress, it prevents us from acting  today to get to this ZTE and Huawei problem. We have a solution, and we  need to get started on it.  Let me also make the point that some things are worth paying for, and  protecting Americans, protecting our electronic system, our broadband  communications from the Chinese-owned Huawei and ZTE is worth paying  for.  What my unanimous consent request would have done, had the Senator  not objected, is we would have passed the bill and leave the issue of  how we fund it to another day. Perhaps the appropriators would have  decided to appropriate money for it. Had they done so, they would have  operated within the budget caps, as the Appropriations Committee has  done, and found room, found some offsets, and paid for it that way.  The proposal I made, that was objected to by my friend from Utah,  would also have left open the possibility of having a pay-for by the  sale of some spectrum.  I regret that the Senator is objecting based on how we will pay for  this very needed expenditure down the road. So I am compelled to object  to my good friend's unanimous consent request.    "
717,Ron Wyden,0.9270560145378113,D,wyden,wyden," Mr. WYDEN. Thank you for that background, Mr. Chairman. I agree with  you that it is clear that the benefit some in the oil and gas industry  are seeking from this provision is illegitimate. However, given the  significant amount of taxpayer dollars at stake should these companies  somehow prevail in litigation, it is also important for Congress to  provide clarity in this area, to protect the public purse. The tax  package under consideration in the spending bill addresses this by  amending the alternative fuel mixture credit to more explicitly deny  the credit for butane mixed with gasoline, consistent congressional  intent. This clarification is effective for any claims filed on or  after January 8, 2018, when the IRS issued a formal revenue ruling  putting taxpayers on notice that a mixture of butane and gasoline does  not qualify for the credit. However, this does not mean we agree that  such mixtures prior to January 8, 2018, qualify for the credit, and, in  fact, we are of the opinion that they do not. Do you agree Mr.  Chairman?    "
718,Todd Young,0.5441849827766418,R,young,young," Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my chief of staff,  Pamela Day. Next month, after 25 years of service--17 of them in my  office--Pam will begin her well-earned retirement.  Pam first arrived on Capitol Hill as a college student and served in  my office with my friend, the late Representative Ben Gilman of New  York. She first started in my office as a legislative assistant, and  her policy knowledge and genuine desire to serve my constituents  quickly became apparent.  Because of her hard work, determination, and positive attitude, Pam  was promoted to legislative director, deputy chief of staff, and,  eventually, she became my chief of staff. Her leadership in my office  has been invaluable.  It is no secret, as dean of the House, I have been here for a long  time. As a Member of this institution for nearly 20 years, Pam stuck  with me through thick and thin, and I will always be grateful for her  faithful service.  She is well respected by everyone, from alumni of my staff and her  colleagues on Capitol Hill, to leaders in the State of Alaska and  advocates far and wide. You simply do not achieve this level of respect  unless you set the gold standard for what a congressional staffer  should be. Pam has gone above and beyond at every turn.  Mr. Speaker, a chief of staff doesn't just assist the Member; they  have an entire team of employees who, at any given time, are working on  countless issues. My staff would agree, Pam is admired, respected, and  will be deeply missed.  Pam's tenure has seen many of the victories I am proud of. She served  in my office while I served as chairman of the Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure and passed our landmark highway bill,  SAFETEA-LU. She also helped pass reauthorization of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery and Conservation Management Act. And her commitment to  constituents has helped secure millions of dollars for organizations  that serve Alaskans and Americans from all walks of life.  Aside from legislative victories, Pam understood the importance of  the relationships in Congress. She made sure that my office was always  in good spirits. And as many will attest, she ensured that our annual  office Christmas parties were the best on the Hill.  Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of Pam, and I am saddened to see her go.  She served me, our State, and our Nation with professionalism,  commitment, and a sincere love of country. She has always been  committed to the next generation of congressional staff and has been a  respected mentor to many of the staffers, both in my office and around  Capitol Hill. Her leadership in my office was invaluable, and she will  be missed by her colleagues as well as myself.  Mr. Speaker, it has been my great honor to call her my chief of staff  and an even greater honor to call her my friend.  Pam, I wish you the best in your retirement. You have certainly  earned it. God bless you, Pam, and thank you for your service.    "
