{"Mr. MENENDEZ": " Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, we have just passed the Armenian  genocide resolution recognition. It is fitting and appropriate that the  Senate stands on the right side of history in doing so. It commemorates  the truth of the Armenian genocide.  On Monday, we commemorated the International Day of Commemoration and  Dignity of the victims of the crime of genocide and of the prevention  of this crime. The UN General Assembly established this day of  remembrance to commemorate and honor the victims of genocide and  highlight efforts to combat and prevent genocide. Passing this  resolution is a fitting tribute to this day of remembrance.  I have come to the floor on various occasions to talk about the  history of the Armenian genocide. An Armenian priest, Krikoris  Balakian, recorded some of the massacres against the Armenians. He  said:  In Ankara and its surroundings, only a couple hundred miles   east of Constantinople, the killing was done with ``axes,   cleavers, shovels, and pitchforks.'' It was like a   slaughterhouse; Armenians were hacked to pieces . . . infants   were dashed on rocks before the eyes of their mothers.  It was indescribable horror. Even when Armenians were supposedly  deported, the conditions they were forced to live in made clear that  Turkey's ultimate goal was to eliminate the Armenian people.  A visitor to one Turkish city in October of 1915 wrote: ``The 16,000  deported Armenians who were living in the tents have been sent to Konia  in cattle trucks. At night, while thousands of these unfortunate  people, without food or shelter, shiver with cold, those brutes who are  supposed to be their guardians attack them with clubs. And push them  towards the station. Women, children, and old men are packed together  in the trucks. The men have to climb on to the top of the trucks, in  spite of the dreadful cold. Their cries are heart-breaking, but all is  in vain. Hunger, cold, and fatigue, together with the Government's  deeds of violence, will soon achieve the extermination of the last  remnant of the Armenian people.''  Henry Morgenthau, the U.S. Ambassador for Turkey, from 1913 to 1916,  understood full well what was transpiring. He left his post in early  1916 because, as he later recalled, ``My failure to stop the  destruction of the Armenians had made Turkey for me a place of  horror.''  American diplomats like Henry Morgenthau were on the ground in  Turkey, and they made heroic efforts to help the Armenian people, but  here in Washington at the time, no one did anything in the face of this  heinous crime.  As former UN Ambassador Samantha Power wrote in her Pulitzer Prize- winning book, ``A Problem from Hell,'' ``America's nonresponse to the  Turkish horrors established patterns that would be repeated.''  As my colleague from Texas, my cosponsor who has been such a stalwart  advocate with me, has very often noted, this is the first genocide to  be recorded in this century. We know all too well the horrors in the  20th century with the Holocaust and other genocides around the world.  So here in the Senate today, we break those patterns. We join the House  and voted to do so by passing a resolution affirming the facts of the  genocide, 405 to 11. Today, the Senate shows the same resolve.  I am deeply grateful to Senator Cruz for his stalwart leadership on  this issue and to the 27 other Senators from both parties who have  cosponsored the resolution and demonstrated their commitment to the  truth, and the truth finally will set us free.  I am thankful that this resolution has passed in a time in which  there are still survivors of the genocide. We will be able to see that  the Senate acknowledges what they left.  Madam President, I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. INHOFE": " Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, after visiting our southern border  countless times, most recently in August when I toured the Mexican side  of the border with their deployed National Guard units, I know that we  face a dire situation that is only improving because of the aggressive  action taken by President Trump. As he and I both know, more needs to  be done. Securing our border is vital to national security.  In our discussions with the Mexican Government following my recent  trip, they expressed strong support for doing work on their southern  border to stem the tide of illegal immigrants from other nations in  Central America. Accordingly, I am proud to introduce the Mirador- Calakmul Basin Maya Security & Conservation Partnership Act, which will  provide critical resources to the region to supplement the efforts made  by the Government of Mexico to secure its own southern border. These  resources will be critical because increased insecurity and lack of  economic opportunity in this region are drivers of emigration from  Guatemala and Mexico to the United States as local communities face  pressure to participate in deforestation, logging, narcotics  trafficking and other illicit activities. It is in the best interest  for the national security of the United States to support political  stability, reduced migration, reduction of poverty, and enhanced  economic development around the basin in Guatemala and Mexico.  The Mirador Basin features beautiful Mayan ruins with networks of  pyramids, palaces, and ancient cities that many consider to be the  eighth wonder of the world, and I would agree. I used to fly my plane  over the Mirador Basin, and I have seen the magnificent structures with  my own eyes. My legislation will support efforts made by the Department  of the Interior, the Department of State, the Mexican Government the  Guatemalan Government and various universities and research  institutions to secure this region and ensure future generations are  afforded the same opportunity to see these magnificent Mayan ruins.  One of the most important things we can do to secure this region is  support the local communities surrounding the Mirador Basin by  providing economic opportunity and ensuring that this community  receives direct economic benefit. If the members of the local community  are able to find work in the region, it will greatly reduce the  incentive to attempt the arduous journey to illegally immigrate to the  United States.  Mr. President, it is critical that we secure our southern border.  Border security is national security. It is just that simple. There are  many proposals targeting this issue, and I support many of them-- including building the wall. This additional legislation is a targeted  approach, and I thank Senators Udall and Risch for joining me in this  initiative.    ", "Mr. HEINRICH": " Mr. HEINRICH. I ask for the yeas and nays.    ", "Mr. THUNE": " Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in 1906, two brothers named Nikolai and  Matthew Gjelsvik arrived at Ellis Island from Norway. The only English  they knew were the words ``apple pie'' and ``coffee,'' which evidently  they learned on the boat on the way over.  The immigration officials at Ellis Island thought that their name  would be too difficult to spell and pronounce in this country, so they  asked them to change their name. The names, when they got to this  country, were Nikolai Gjelsvik, spelled G-J-E-L-S-V-I-K, and his  brother was named Matthew.  So the immigration officials asked them to change their name, and  they picked the name from the farm where they worked near Bergen,  Norway, which was called the Thune farm. So Nikolai Gjelsvik became  Nick Thune, my grandfather.  He and his brother worked on the railroad as they built it west  across South Dakota. They learned English and saved up enough money to  start a small merchandising company and then later a hardware store in  Mitchell, SD. To this day, there is a Thune Hardware in Mitchell,  although the family sold it many years ago.  In 1916, Nick Thune married an Iowa girl who had moved to South  Dakota to teach school, and they had three sons. The middle son,  Harold, will turn 100 in a few days, and that middle son happens to be  my dad.  Like many of my colleagues, I send congratulatory notes to  constituents for big birthdays and anniversaries. I never thought I  would have the occasion to send one to my dad. I figured for this one,  instead of writing a letter, I would come to the floor.  My dad is a World War II veteran. He is a member of that ``greatest  generation,'' and he shares the qualities of so many in that  generation--humility, patriotism, quiet service. Dad was a Navy pilot  who flew Hellcats off the USS Intrepid, and he was an excellent pilot.  He received the Distinguished Flying Cross for shooting down four enemy  planes in one engagement. As a side note to that, that accommodation  was issued to him by none other than ADM John McCain, Senator John  McCain's grandfather.  But my dad didn't and still doesn't talk about his own exploits. In  fact, had it not been for my mom, I am quite sure I never would have  known about my dad's record in World War II. I did have the opportunity  to interview him for the Library of Congress's Veterans History Project  a few years back, and he shared some wonderful details about his  service. As usual, his focus was never on his own achievements but on  those of his fellow pilots.  I also probably would never have learned what an outstanding athlete  my dad was, had it not been for my mom. My dad grew up in the small  town of Murdo, SD, during the Great Depression. They didn't have a lot,  but there were a lot of basketball hoops around Murdo. They put them on  barns, poles, garages, and my dad learned to play. In fact, he learned  to play so well that he took his high school basketball team to the  State championship game where, although they lost narrowly, he was  named the tournament's most valuable player.  My dad had hoped to attend college in South Dakota, but there was a  doctor in Murdo named Joseph Murphy who thought my dad was good enough  to play at the University of Minnesota and used his contacts to get my  dad up to Hibbing Junior College in hopes that the Minnesota Gophers  would notice him. Well, they did. He went to the Twin Cities on a  scholarship and played three seasons for the Gophers. He was the team's  most valuable player in his junior year. In fact, he was high point man  in Madison Square Garden on his birthday, December 28, 1940.  In another example of how things have changed through the years, my  dad said that when his team came out to play for the second game that  night at the Garden, you couldn't see the upper deck because of all the  cigarette smoke. Some things do change for the better.  While at the University of Minnesota, my dad met a girl who served  sodas at a drugstore just off campus. They were married within a couple  of years while my dad was in flight training for the Navy, and they  spent the next almost 69 years together.  After the war, they came back to South Dakota. My dad had been  thinking about a career in the Navy, but his dad asked him to come back  and run the family hardware store. My dad said that his heart sank, but  he knew that is what he had to do. So he went home and went to work for  his dad. The hardware store did OK for a while, but started to  struggle. My dad sold it and went back to school and got a teaching  degree.  All parents are teachers for their kids, but my parents were teachers  several times over. Kids usually get a break from their parents when  they are at school. My dad was a teacher at my high school. He was also  a coach and the athletic director, and he drove the bus. My mom was the  school librarian. So I think it is safe to say that my brothers and  sister and I were pretty much always under the watchful eye of my  parents. I have to say that I never had my dad for a class in high  school, but my brother Rich did. Rich was the valedictorian of his high  school class, and the only B he got in high school was from my dad.  That was my dad for you. He never showed any preference or gave any of  his kids better treatment than anybody else. In fact, some of us might  argue that he gave us a harder time because we were his kids. But he  believed very firmly that you had to earn your achievements.  As a coach, my dad taught us about being a team player. He made it  clear that being on a team was not about building your personal  statistics but about making the players around you better. It is a  lesson I have carried throughout my life and one that I try to live by  every day.  A few years ago, the Jones County School District in Murdo named the  auditorium in Murdo after my dad in recognition of his service and  achievements at the school. It was particularly special since my dad  was one of the volunteers who originally built the auditorium back in  the 1950s. My dad would tell me the story that he was more scared up on  the scaffolding of that building than he had ever been flying off a  carrier during World War II.  You might think that with my dad as coach and athletic director,  sports were the main focus around our house. They certainly were a big  part of our lives. But my mom was determined that we would grow up to  be well-rounded people, and my dad always supported her in that. They  worked hard to ensure that we grew up with a perspective on life that  went beyond just the latest sporting event. Mom made us take piano  lessons and, during the summers, come in from outside and read for an  hour every day. We complained at the time, but I know all of us today  are grateful to her and my father for their investments in that.  Mom and Dad made a good team. Mom was an optimist, and Dad was a  pessimist--or, as he would put it, a realist--and they balanced each  other out well. We didn't have material riches growing up, but we were  beyond rich in those things that money can't buy but that lend purpose,  joy, and meaning to life. All of us Thune kids are very, very grateful  for that heritage.  I can't close without talking about something that was life-changing  for my parents, and that was their strong faith in Christ. My dad  always had real discernment and wisdom in no small part because of his  daily dependence upon God in his life. God blessed him with it. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7223\">Page S7223</a>, ]  As we celebrate my dad's 100th birthday, I want to say thank you to  you for the example of faith, integrity, character, and humility that  you have given to me and to Bob and to Rich and to Karen and to Tim.  Thank you for faithfully serving God's purpose for your generation and  happy 100th birthday.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. SCHUMER": " Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, last night, the House of Representatives  voted to impeach President Donald Trump. It is only the third time in  our Nation's history that the President of the United States has been  impeached.  The articles of impeachment charge that President Trump abused the  powers of his office by soliciting the interference of a foreign power  in our elections, not for the good of the country but to benefit  himself personally. The articles also charge that the President  obstructed Congress in the investigation of those matters. Together,  these articles suggest the President committed a grave injury to our  grand democracy.  The conduct they describe is very much what the Founders feared when  they forged the impeachment powers of the Congress. The Founders, in  their wisdom, gave the House the power to accuse and the Senate the  power to judge. We are now asked to fulfill our constitutional role as  a court of impeachment.  Now that the House of Representatives has impeached President Trump,  the Nation turns its eyes to the Senate. What will the Nation see? Will  the Nation see what Alexander Hamilton saw--a body of government with  ``confidence enough . . . to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the  necessary impartiality,'' or will the Nation see the Senate dragged  into the depths of partisan fervor?  The Nation just witnessed how the Republican leader sees his role in  this chapter of our history--demonstrating both an unfortunate descent  into partisanship and demonstrating the fundamental weakness of the  President's defense.  Leader McConnell claimed that the impeachment of President Trump is  illegitimate because the House voted along party lines. Forgive me, but  House Democrats cannot be held responsible for the cravenness of the  House Republican caucus and their blind fealty to the President.  Leader McConnell claimed that the impeachment was motivated by  partisan rage--this from the man who said proudly, ``I am not  impartial. I have no intention to be impartial at all'' in the trial of  President Trump. What hypocrisy.  Leader McConnell accused the House Democrats of an obsession to get  rid of President Trump--this from the man who proudly declared his  ``number one goal'' was to make President Obama a one-term President.  Leader McConnell claimed that Democrats impeached the President for  asserting Executive privilege. President Trump never formally claimed  Executive privilege; he claimed ``absolute immunity,'' and the White  House Counsel wrote a letter stating simply that the administration  would not comply with any subpoenas.  Leader McConnell claimed that the Democrats' ``obsession'' with  impeachment has prevented the House from pursuing legislation to help  the American people. Leader McConnell knows very, very well that the  House Democratic majority has passed literally hundreds of bills that  gather dust here in the Senate, condemned to a legislative graveyard by  none other than Leader McConnell himself, who proudly called himself  the Grim Reaper.  Members of the 116th Senate have been denied the opportunity to  legislate by Leader McConnell. We aren't even allowed to debate the  issues that would impact the American people: healthcare,  infrastructure, prescription drugs. We could have spent the year  debating these issues. We weren't doing impeachment. Leader McConnell  has chosen not to focus on these issues and to put none of these bills  on the floor. As he reminds us often, he alone decides what goes on the  floor. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7171\">Page S7171</a>, ]  Leader McConnell claimed that the House did not afford the President  due process. The leader knows well that President Trump refused to  participate in the process, despite invitation, and blocked witnesses  and documents from Congress in unprecedented fashion.  Leader McConnell claimed that the House ran the ``most rushed, least  thorough, and most unfair impeachment inquiry in modern history.'' I  know that is the Republican talking point, but here is the reality:  Leader McConnell is plotting the most rushed, least thorough, and most  unfair impeachment trial in modern history. His plan to prevent House  managers from calling witnesses to prove their case is a dramatic break  from precedent.  We heard a lot about precedent from the leader. Never has there been  a Presidential impeachment trial in which the majority prevented the  House managers from fairly presenting their case, to have witnesses  explain their knowledge of the alleged malfeasance. Will Leader  McConnell, breaking precedent, strong-arm his caucus into making this  the first Senate impeachment trial of a President in history that heard  no witnesses?  We ask: Is the President's case so weak that none of the President's  men can defend him under oath? Is the President's case so weak that  none of the President's men can defend him under oath? If the House  case is so weak, why is Leader McConnell so afraid of witnesses and  documents? We believe the House case is strong, very strong, but if the  Republican leader believes it is so weak, why is he so afraid of  relevant witnesses and documents, which will not prolong things very  long in our proposal--four hours for each witness?  It is true, as the leader has said, that the Framers built the Senate  to provide stability and to keep partisan passions from boiling over.  However, their vision of the Senate is a far cry from the partisan body  Senator McConnell has created.  I hope America was watching the Republican leader deliver his speech.  I really do, because most glaring of all was the fact that Leader  McConnell's 30-minute partisan stem-winder contained hardly a single  defense of the President of the United States on the merits. Almost  none have defended President Trump because they can't.  In the wake of an enormous amount of evidence uncovered by House  investigators--much of it in the form of testimony by top Trump  officials whom the administration tried to silence--the Republican  leader could not rebut the accusations against the President with  facts. The Republican leader complained about the process. The  Republican leader made very partisan and inflammatory accusations about  Democrats, but he did not advance an argument in defense of the  President's conduct on the merits. That, in and of itself, is a damning  reflection on the state of the President's defense.  Our goal in the Senate, above all, should be to conduct a fair and  speedy trial. I have proposed a very reasonable structure that would do  just that: four witnesses, only those with direct knowledge of the  charges made by the House; only those who could provide new, relevant  and potentially illumination testimony; strict time limits on each  stage of the process to prevent the trial from dragging out too long.  It is eminently reasonable; it is eminently fair. A group with no  partisan bias would come up with this type of proposal.  I have yet to hear one good argument as to why less evidence is  better than more evidence, particularly in such a serious moment as  impeachment of the President of the United States. In Leader  McConnell's 30-minute screed, he did not make one argument as to why  witnesses and documents should not be a part of the trial.  President Trump protests that he did not receive due process in the  House impeachment inquiry. Due process is the ability to respond to  charges made against you and present your side of the case. The  President was invited to provide witnesses and provide documents at  every stage of the process. He chose not to.  Still, Democrats are offering the President due process again here in  the Senate. The witnesses we suggest are top Trump-appointed officials.  They aren't Democrats. We don't know if their testimony would exculpate  the President or incriminate him, but their testimony should be heard.  If the President's counsel wants to call other witnesses with direct  knowledge of why the aid to Ukraine was delayed, we say that they  should be able to do so. President Trump claims he wants due process. I  suspect he would rather hide or name-call because if he really wanted  due process, he could get it easily. One phone call to Leader McConnell  telling him to let his aides testify, one phone call to his chief of  staff telling him to release the documents to Congress--both of these  actions would let the truth come out. I ask again: Can none of the  President's men come defend him under oath?  To my Republican colleagues, our message is a simple one. Democrats  want a fair trial that examines the relevant facts. We want a fair  trial. The message from Leader McConnell at the moment is that he has  no intention of conducting a fair trial, no intention of acting  impartially, no intention of getting the facts.  Despite our disagreements, I will meet with Leader McConnell soon to  discuss the rules, but each Senator will influence whether the Senate  lives up to its constitutional duty to serve as an impartial court of  impeachment. In the coming weeks, Republican senators will face a  choice. Each Republican Senator will face a choice. Do they want a fair  trial or do they want to allow the President free rein? Each Senator  must ask himself or herself: Do you want a fair trial or do you want  the President to do whatever he wants, regardless of the rule of law,  regardless of the consequences to this great Nation?  The Nation turns its eyes to the Senate. What will it see?  The President of the United States has spent the past several months  telling Congress that it has no right to oversight and no right to  investigate any of his activities; that he has absolute immunity; that  article II of the Constitution gives him the ``right to do whatever he  wants.'' Those are the President's words. Past Senates have disagreed  with such views and strongly, proudly stood up for the notion that the  President is not omnipotent. Democrats have done it; Republicans have  done it--and often Presidents of their own party.  The Senate has said in the past that the President serves the people,  not himself; that he is not a King. Will it do so again or will it  shirk from that responsibility?  If the Republicans lead with the majority leader's scheme to sweep  these charges under the rug and permit the President to ignore  Congress, they will be creating a new precedent that will long be  remembered as one of the Senate's darkest chapters. It will be  remembered as a time when a simple majority in the Senate sought to  grant two new rights to the President: the right to use the government  for personal purposes and the right to ignore Congress at his pleasure.  Here I agree with Senator McConnell: ``Moments like this are why the  Senate exists.'' If the President commits high crimes and misdemeanors  and the Congress can do nothing about it, not even conduct a fair  tribunal where his conduct is judged by dispassionate representatives  of the people, then the President can commit those crimes with  impunity. This President can; others can.  I have little doubt that if we tell the President that he can escape  scrutiny in this instance, he will do it again and again and again.  Future Presidents will take note and may do worse. The most powerful  check on the Executive, the one designed to protect the people from  tyranny, will be erased.  This chapter in our history books could be a lesson about the erosion  of checks and balances in our modern age or it could be a proud  reaffirmation of those founding principles. This chapter in our history  books could be about the overpowering partisanship of our times or it  could be about the Senate's capacity to overcome it. Again, moments  like this are why the U.S. Senate exists.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. GRASSLEY": " Mr. GRASSLEY. I do agree. The IRS got the law correct when it issued  Revenue Ruling 2018-2, and our clarification makes clear that it is our  intent for the IRS interpretation of the law to be controlling for all  claims. This is the basis of the ``no inference'' language in the bill  that states: ``Nothing contained in this subsection or the amendments  made by this subsection shall be construed to create any inference as  to a change in law or guidance in effect prior to enactment of this  subsection.''  I thank the ranking member for engaging in this colloquy to discuss  this important issue and the clarification included in the pending  appropriations bill.    ", "Mr. CORNYN": " Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, following the longest government shutdown  in history earlier this year, it seemed to be a bipartisan consensus  that we need to get back on track with the regular appropriations  process. Both parties knew there was a funding crisis at stake this  fall if we could not come together and reach a compromise, so this  summer, that is exactly what we did--or at least we thought we did. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7138\">Page S7138</a>, ]  At the time we reached an agreement that set top-line funding levels  for defense and nondefense spending, there was a promise not to derail  the appropriations process with poison-pill policy riders, and we got  it done in August with plenty of time to spare. It wasn't perfect. No  negotiated product ever is, but we knew this agreement would provide us  the time and the space and the framework to get the appropriations  process back on track and leave room for necessary debate on government  spending habits. As our national deficit continues to grow, that could  not be more critical. I actually remember a time when concern about the  deficit and debt was a bipartisan concern, but apparently, it is not  currently.  Before we hit the first funding deadline, our Democratic colleagues  backed out of the commitment they made in August of 2019. The open  debate we hoped for did not happen. We were forced to pass two short- term funding bills known as continuing resolutions, and now, here we  are, just days away from the current continuing resolutions expiration,  reading text of these funding bills that total nearly $1.4 trillion. We  are reading these for the first time.  When it comes to the appropriations process, I have learned from  experience; you are never going to be 100 percent happy. That is just  the nature of compromise. You have got to weigh the good, the bad, and  the ugly and decide how the scales tip. There is certainly a lot of  calculating when it comes to these appropriation bills, but let me  start with the good. I think the national security appropriations  package goes a long way to rebuilding our military, providing them the  resources they need to maintain readiness, and providing our Armed  Forces with the resources they need to face growing threats around the  world. From adversaries like Russia and China, to rogue regimes like  North Korea and Iran, our military must be prepared to counter a  diverse range of threats.  This funding bill will continue the work of Congress under President  Trump to invest in our military by providing a nearly $20 billion  increase over last year's defense funding levels. It will provide funds  to both modernize and grow our aging fleet so we can continue to send  our troops around the world where they are needed. One of the major  challenges we face is the development of new technologies by our  adversaries. We cannot have our enemies deploying hypersonic glide  vehicles, artificial intelligence, and missile defense systems that  rival or perhaps surpass our own. That would be destabilizing. That may  produce a miscalculation, which would be dangerous.  This bill sends funding toward the research and development of new  technologies so we can stay on the leading edge. We should not be  satisfied with anything other than America being in the lead when it  comes to our national security.  I am glad this package also includes a number of provisions that  support our men and women in uniform, including a 3.1 percent pay  increase, which is the largest in a decade. Above all, this defense  funding answers our commanders' request for steady and predictable  funding so they can address and plan for the threats of today and  prepare for those we will face tomorrow.  In addition to strengthening our national security, this package will  also make our community safer here at home. It sends vital funding to  the Department of Justice law enforcement grant programs and invests  $1.4 billion in the border wall system on the Southwest border. As a  border State Senator, I can tell you the Border Patrol, whom I consider  the experts when it comes to border security, say there are three  components of border security: There is physical infrastructure; there  is technology; and then there is the personnel, the boots on the  ground. This appropriation bill invests $1.4 billion in this system  that includes a border wall.  Despite concerted attempts from our Democratic colleagues, the  President's authorities to transfer funds that he deems necessary for  border security remain intact.  Now, the domestic spending bill takes strides to address some other  challenges. It allows us to bolster our fight against the opioid  epidemic, expand mental health access, and improve our crumbling  transportation infrastructure. It includes $400 million for farmers and  ranchers in Texas and elsewhere affected by drought, trade wars, and  low commodity prices. It would also send an additional half a billion  dollars to the Army Corps of Engineers that can be used for  infrastructure projects right here at home.  With less than a year until the next election, it would provide more  than $400 million in additional funds to safeguard our election systems  so that voters can head to the polls with the confidence that their  vote will be counted correctly.  As we continue to bring down healthcare costs for the American people  by providing them more choice and competition for their premium dollar,  this legislation permanently repeals some of the three most oppressive  ObamaCare taxes that are burdening American families: the premium tax,  the Cadillac tax, and the medical device tax.  This bill also extends funding for critical healthcare programs like  community health centers. This is the safety net in our healthcare  system, the community health center. It is something I have long  supported.  Despite pushes from our colleagues across the aisle, appropriators  also managed to fight off an electric vehicle tax credit expansion,  which would be nothing more than a taxpayer subsidy for wealthy  Americans who want to purchase electric vehicles.  There are a lot of great provisions in these appropriations bills to  address some of our top priorities, but I remain concerned that, with  some of the shortcomings, these could also be described as the bad part  of this appropriation process.  The domestic funding bill includes a range of controversial  provisions that will move us further away from our goal of decreasing  the national debt. It significantly increases deficit spending without  offsets or pay-fors for long-needed reforms for mandatory spending  programs, which are the primary cause of our deficits and debt,  accounting for about 70 percent of Federal spending.  This bill also includes a terrible provision, which is a retroactive  tax on American energy companies. We did this without any sort of  consideration by the committee of jurisdiction--the Finance Committee,  upon which I sit--with no opportunity to provide amendments or even a  debate on this massive retroactive tax. The only choice we are given  now that it has been included as a result of the negotiations among  five people is the choice to vote either up or down on this massive  piece of legislation.  This bill also extends other tax benefits, without addressing  problems with the Tax Code, which actually have a negative impact on  American businesses and families.  This funding bill would also extend the National Flood Insurance  Program, which is long overdue for reforms. This sidesteps the need for  those reforms entirely. The program is hemorrhaging money, and we need  to be looking at ways to improve it, instead of continuing to flush  good money down the drain.  As I mention, we started this process on a strong path with the  budget agreement that was reached in August. I know I wasn't alone in  thinking that would help us get the regular appropriations process back  on track, but things quickly took a turn--not for the good, not for the  bad--but for the ugly. Our colleagues let government funding come  second to their disagreements with the President. They tried to inject  the very poison pills they vowed to steer clear of and derailed the  process that they committed to restoring.  Rather than having an open debate and votes on spending, as we  planned, the process fell to just a handful of people negotiating  behind closed doors. This is reminiscent of the smoke-filled backroom  deals that Congress has long been criticized for, and we really have no  alternative but to vote up or down on this massive $1.4 trillion  spending package without any opportunity to debate it or, more  importantly, to change it by offering amendments.  The way I see it, this has been the plan of Speaker Pelosi and the  minority leader here in the Senate all along. If you think about it,  this really puts the power in their hands, which is exactly what they  want, and they can extract concessions and other things that [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7139\">Page S7139</a>, ] are important to them, rather than allow the process to work as it was  intended to do through regular order, through the regular  appropriations process.  This also takes power from their very own Members because no Democrat  or Republican can offer any amendment to this which can change it at  all under this closed process. So this really isn't just an affront to  the Members on this side of the aisle; it is an affront to their own  Members who have no opportunity to offer amendments or have meaningful  debate and modify the bill.  Our Democratic colleagues have held these appropriations process  hostage for the past several months. Over what? I think that is an  important question. Well, as it turns out, it was their obsession with  .3 percent of our Nation's budget. That is not how this process should  work, and it is certainly not how to make decisions that are in the  best interest of the country.  As further evidence of the rush to get this done without adequate  consideration or debate or amendment, our House Democrats even had to  violate their own 72-hour posting rule for major legislation just to  get this legislation done before we leave this week.  It is frustrating to see our colleagues across the aisle undermine  what could have been a very productive discussion about our Nation's  spending habits, about deficits and debt and what our priorities should  be, and, instead, chose to move forward with these bills, which fall  short in any number of places.  I must say that the majority leader, the Senator from Kentucky, was  committed to a process of getting these appropriations back on track so  we could give a voice to all Members in these negotiations and take  them up in an orderly fashion so amendments could be offered, and they  could be debated and voted on, all of which has now been swept to the  side.  I am also grateful for the tireless work of the chairman of the  Appropriations Committee in the Senate, the Senator from Alabama, Mr.  Shelby, as well as the other members of the committee who have been  negotiating an agreement to support our national defense and avoid  book-ending the 2019 year with a second shutdown.  As we move closer to a vote on these appropriations bills tomorrow, I  am going to continue to review their text. They are massive pieces of  legislation, and we have only recently gotten access to them. I will be  making my individual decision--as I trust each Member will--on whether  to support these appropriations bills and whether they represent the  best interests of their States and of the American people.    ", "Mr. RUBIO": " Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague Senator Scott  for offering this and all of our colleagues and, of course, all of the  Senators who voted for it unanimously.  My colleague from Florida has already mentioned the three names of  those in the service of our country who lost their lives in Pensacola.  I will talk about them more in a moment.  I do want to say a couple of things. First, Pensacola really is one  of the hidden gems of the State that Senator Scott and I represent. To  understand Pensacola, you must understand that is it not just a city in  which a naval facility is located. The Navy is very [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7137\">Page S7137</a>, ] much a part of the fiber of that community. I would almost equate it to  a college town's relationship with a university; that is how much its  identity is connected to this naval air station. This attack wasn't  just an attack on this facility, but it was an attack on the heart and  soul of Pensacola as a community.  As I had an opportunity to visit in the aftermath of the attack, I  was not just deeply saddened by the loss of life but impacted, first,  by the way the community responded and, second, by some of the stories,  which I hope we will learn more about as the information comes out, of  extraordinary bravery--not just the first responders but others who  happened to be there at that time who exhibited extraordinary stories  of heroism in the face of evil in this terror attack. People rushed  into the building the gunshots were coming from instead of running away  as most people would do. I want to point out some of those things.  ENS Joshua Kaleb Watson, who was mentioned earlier, happened to be  the officer on deck at the time of the shooting, and he ran toward the  shooter and was yelling for people to get out of the way. He actually  proceeded to tackle the killer and fought him in an attempt to disarm  him, all while being shot at least five separate times. He was wounded,  but he, nevertheless, happened to make his way out to flag down first  responders and be able to give an accurate description of the shooter,  which ultimately allowed him to be neutralized.  Amn Mohammed Haitham's family moved to St. Petersburg from New  Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. His school's assistant principal  called him ``the Perfect One'' because he was a good student, a track  star, and basketball player. This is a quote from the assistant  principal:  [He] would walk into any room and it would light up. He had   this magnetic personality--big smile, always happy. And   people would always gravitate toward him.  His commanding officer told his father that it was his son Mohammed  who had also bravely attempted to take down the gunman and lost his  life.  Then there was Cameron Walters of Georgia, described as ``an amazing  guy, he always had something good to say to everybody, and was always  smiling.''  The morning of the shooting, Airman Walters was randomly assigned to  watch duty in Building 633. He had been stationed in Pensacola for only  2 weeks before this attack.  Again, I want to thank Senator Scott, my colleague of Florida, for  offering this. It ensures that not only will we not forget the heroes  who sacrificed their lives while protecting fellow Navy members as this  tragedy unfolded, but it also reminds us of the obligation we have to  get to the bottom of how this happened and why this happened so that it  may never, ever happen anywhere again.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. UDALL": " Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, Werner Gellert survived the Holocaust and never forgot that terrible injustice. Werner went on to found a museum in Albuquerque dedicated not only to educating people about the Holocaust but dedicated to stopping intolerance wherever it is found. Werner Gellert was born on June 14, 1926 in Breslau, Germany. During November 9 and 10, 1938, Nazi paramilitary forces carried out a pogrom throughout Germany demolishing and ransacking Jewish homes, businesses, synagogues, schools, and hospitals. At that time, 267 synagogues in Germany and surrounding areas and 7,000 Jewish businesses were destroyed and over 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and incarcerated in concentration camps. That pogrom was called Night of the Broken Glass, or Kristallnacht, meaning ``Crystal Night,'' because of all the broken glass scattered throughout the streets from the shattered windows of Jewish buildings. After the Night of the Broken Glass, Werner and his adopted parents fled Germany for Shanghai, one of the only places in the world at that time that accepted Jews unconditionally. However, the Japanese who were occupying Shanghai became allied with the Germans, and, on February 18, 1943, they issued a proclamation establishing a restricted area where ``stateless refugees'' must live and work. Werner and his family were relocated to this restricted area, Hongkew, which became plagued with disease and starvation. On one of his birthdays, Werner asked only for a loaf of bread and jar of jam for himself, but he didn't get his wish. During this period, he suffered through starvation, typhus, yellow fever, and hepatitis, and he was brutalized by a bully and permanently lost most of the sight in one of his eyes. After the end of World War II, Werner remained in Shanghai, working as a typewriter repairman for the U.S. Army. The Army recognized his intelligence and linguistic skills--he spoke seven languages--and recruited him into Army intelligence as a civilian consultant. He worked undercover for the United States in China, Tibet, and the Philippines. The Chinese Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and early 1970s drove out Werner and his family, and they fortunately were able to escape on the last boat out of Shanghai to the United States. They relocated to Denver, where Werner attended Denver University and met his future wife, Frances Silverman--known as ``Frankie''--to whom he was married for 54 years, until her passing in 2007. After a successful career in the savings and loan business in California, Werner and Frankie retired to Albuquerque. Werner fervently believed that education was the most effective weapon against hate and intolerance. With that guiding principal in mind, in 2001, he and Frankie founded the Albuquerque Holocaust and Intolerance Museum. The museum is dedicated to educating the public through its exhibitions on the horrors and injustices of hate--from the Holocaust, to the African-American experience here in the United States to genocide of minority peoples around the world. Its goal is to promote ``upstanders,'' not bystanders: people who speak out and act to support individuals, groups, or causes attacked or bullied. The museum is home to the Library of Remembrance, a compilation of more than 4,500 books, documents, and videos about the injustice of genocide, bullying, and intolerance. As long as he was able, well into his eighties, Werner spoke to school groups at the museum and around the State teaching them about his experience during the Holocaust and as a refugee in Shanghai. Werner took his own terrible experience and set about to make a better, more understanding, more tolerant world for others. While we lost Werner on November 9, 2019, at age 93, [[<a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7206\">Page S7206</a>]] his commitment to ending genocide, intolerance, and bullying will live on through the Albuquerque Holocaust and Intolerance Museum.<bullet>   ", "Mr. LEAHY": " Mr. LEAHY.

May you all have a happy and  blessed holiday season.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. CARDIN": " Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we need to pass the Combating Global  Corruption Act. Today, I join with my colleague Senator Young to  reaffirm bipartisan support for this important legislation.  Corruption threatens international stability and security and poses a  serious threat to democracy and democratic values. Ten days ago,  December 9, was International AntiCorruption Day. This day provides an  annual reminder of the dire need to prioritize combatting corruption  here in the United States and around the world.  Corruption undermines democratic institutions, it compromises the  rule of law, and it erodes human rights protections. It damages  America's global competitiveness and hampers economic growth in global  markets. It fosters the conditions for violent extremism and weakens  institutions associated with governance and accountability. These are  direct threats to our national and international security.  Earlier this year, Transparency International published its  Corruption Perceptions Index for 2018. It underscored that the failure  to curb corruption is contributing to a worldwide crisis of democracy.  Not surprisingly then, Freedom House similarly reported that 2018 was  marked by global declines in political rights and civil liberties for  the 13th consecutive year. Sixty-eight countries suffered net declines  in political rights and civil liberties during 2018, with only 50  nations registering gains.  We have all seen the headlines in recent years--from scandals in  Liberia, Hungary, and Guatemala, to the doping by Russian athletes and  their subsequent ban from the 2016 Summer Olympics and using aid to  influence other nations' behavior.  It is clear that where there are high levels of corruption, we find  fragile states, authoritarian states, or states suffering from internal  or external conflict--in places such as Lebanon, Afghanistan and  Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Nigeria, and Sudan.  Different domestic issues may have sparked the wave of massive  protests we are observing today--whether they be increases in gas  prices or metro fares--but many of these uprisings have been sustained  by public desire to weed out leaders' corruption. Corruption is no  longer being tolerated or excused.  Corruption operates via extensive and entrenched networks in both the  public and private sectors. It is ubiquitous and pervasive, but we must  address it. The costs of not addressing it or rooting it out are just  too great.  Mr. President, we must be clear-eyed--any fight against corruption  will be long-term and difficult. It is a fight against powerful people,  powerful companies, and powerful interests. It is about changing a  mindset and a culture as much as it is about establishing and enforcing  laws.  While previous anti-corruption legislation has been crucial, the  Combatting Global Corruption Act takes our commitment to this value  further by bringing a whole-of-government approach to the issue and  bringing more transparency to the instances of corruption going on  unnoticed in every country around the world.  The Combatting Global Corruption Act requires the State Department to  produce an annual assessment, either by a briefing or by a report,  similar to the Trafficking in Persons Report, which takes a close look  at each country's efforts to combat corruption. The assessment will  measure indicators such as transparency, accountability, enforcement of  anti-corruption laws, and the extent to which public power is used for  private gain.  That model, which has effectively advanced the effort to combat  modern-day slavery, will similarly embed the issue of corruption in our  collective work and make other nations more conscious of their  corruption levels.  The bill includes clear definitions of corruption and corrupt  activities and underscores the importance of prioritizing corruption  into strategic planning--across our agencies, bureaus, and our missions  overseas.  It specifically increases coordination on anti-corruption efforts  between the Department of State and USAID and formally engages our  embassies in the fight against corruption by establishing anti- corruption points of contact at our Embassies in critical countries.  We work across multiple agencies and in multiple offices to combat  corruption. The roles of these points of contact, comprised of either  the chief of mission or personnel designated for the role by the chief  of mission, will foster greater coordination on anticorruption efforts  within the U.S. government.  It is time for the U.S. Congress to send a strong message to our  Nation and to the world that corruption cannot be accepted as the  status quo.  It is time that we back up our words--our commitment to supporting  democratization, human rights, and fairness globally--with action to  protect those critically important values. Let's pass the Combating  Global Corruption Act.    ", "Mr. WARNER": " Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to a group  of veterans who served this country decades ago but who continue to  suffer to this day as a result of their service. I am talking about  hundreds of thousands of veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange  during their service.  From 1962 to 1975, the United States sprayed over 20 million gallons  of Agent Orange across Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Millions of our  servicemembers, not to mention millions of Vietnamese civilians, were  exposed. Fifty years later, hundreds of thousands of Vietnam-era  veterans are still paying the price.  From the start, the Federal Government has tried to slow-walk  attempts to cover the care these veterans earned. It wasn't until 1991  that the VA recognized the connection between Agent Orange exposure and  several diseases and conditions, finally allowing these veterans to  seek treatment from the VA. Currently, the list of conditions at the VA  stands at 14, but science tells us the list is far from complete.  In 2017, then-Veterans Affairs Secretary Shulkin called for three  more conditions to be added to the list: bladder cancer, underactive  thyroid, and Parkinson's-like symptoms. Now, these weren't randomly  chosen. They were conditions found by the National Academy of Science  to be connected to Agent Orange exposure.  The science was there. The VA was there. Yet this White House and its  OMB Director, Mick Mulvaney, have blocked this effort to expand the  list of conditions.  Do you know what the deciding factor was? It wasn't scientific  evidence. It wasn't the advice of VA doctors. No, the White House  decided that the cost of providing care to 83,000 veterans suffering  from these conditions was just too high, and for that this  administration turned its back on 83,000 veterans who answered the call  to serve.  Unfortunately, this is just the latest example of the Federal  Government trying to avoid paying for the care of men and women our  Nation sent to war. My office hears regularly from veterans facing  problems like prostate cancer, Parkinson's, and other conditions that  have been linked to Agent Orange. Time and again, we hear how the VA  tries to deny benefits on the basis of a technicality. This is just not  right. Unfortunately, this administration is far from the first to  ignore evidence about Agent Orange in order to save a few bucks.  I want to share a few stories from my State of Virginia, where more  than 204,000 Vietnam veterans currently call home. In many cases,  veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange have been fighting multiple  administrations to get these life-or-death benefits--benefits they  earned by their service decades ago.  One veteran, William Badgett of Hampton, VA, was exposed to Agent  Orange during his service in Vietnam with the Army. He was in the 101st  Airborne, 1st Cavalry, where he served as a helicopter mechanic and  supply sergeant. He has been diagnosed with a number of health  conditions, including enlarged prostate, osteoporosis, kidney disease,  and hardened arteries, none of which are on the VA's presumptive list.  While the VA considers prostate cancer to be on the list, Mr.  Badgett's enlarged prostate is not presumed by the VA to be connected  to his exposure to Agent Orange simply because it is not cancer.  Another example: Sam Harvey from Newport News, VA, was exposed to  Agent Orange during the Vietnam war. He served in the U.S. Navy from  1966 to 1970 aboard the USS Constellation. He was diagnosed with  aggressive prostate cancer. Yet, with prostate cancer being on the  presumptive list, he struggled to get VA approval for the treatment he  needs.  Finally, I want to talk about Dorman Watts from North Chesterfield,  VA. He suffered for years to get the disability rating from the VA that  will qualify him for the comprehensive care from the VA. He has  prostate cancer and heart disease and is currently undergoing radiation  treatment from a private provider. This is unacceptable.  That is why I am glad Congress included important accountability  measures as part of the Defense appropriations legislation we passed  this week. Finally, after years of reluctance, years of ignoring the  science, these veterans are going to get some of the answers about the  conditions that have resulted from their service.  There is more than enough evidence to expand the list of Agent  Orange-related conditions. We should be thanking these veterans for  their service, not nickel-and-diming them. I urge my colleagues to  listen to the veterans in their States, and I urge the White House to  let the VA provide these veterans with the benefits they have earned.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    ", "Mr. KAINE": " Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Protecting  Critical Services for Mothers and Babies Act, with my colleague Senator  Perdue. Enacting this bill will help ensure that mothers and infants  across the country continue to receive access to important health  programs.  About 700 women die each year in the United States from complications  during or after pregnancy, a problem that disproportionately affects  Black and American Indian/Alaskan Native women. In the face of these  challenges, organizations like March of Dimes provide services that  disseminate health information to pregnant women and mothers and  support care for premature and ill infants.  Inflexible funding rules and historically low interest rates have  combined to result in a sharp increase in March of Dimes' pension  funding obligations next year. This Act will extend more flexible rules  to organizations that have a long track record of serving maternal and  infant health needs. These rules, already offered to other  organizations, will continue to protect plan participants while also  smoothing out pension funding obligations. This change will ensure that  resources are not diverted away from important maternal and infant  health programs.    ", "Mr. RISCH": " Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I rise today on a more somber note to pay tribute to members of the Hansen family who recently lost their lives in a tragic accident. For Jim Hansen, family is what mattered most in life. This past Thanksgiving, he was with his sons, grandsons, and great-grandson, participating in an annual hunting activity that had become a family tradition. On November 30, 2019, they were returning from this cherished family time, when a tragic plane accident took the lives of nine members of the Hansen family: Jim Hansen, Sr., Jim Hansen, Jr., Kirk Hansen, Stockton Hansen, Logan Hansen, Kyle Naylor, Tyson Dennert, Jake Hansen, and Houston Hansen. My wife Vicki and I offer our deepest condolences and our hearts go out to the remaining family members during this overwhelmingly difficult time. Their loss will not only be felt throughout their community in eastern Idaho, but also by countless others throughout the world who have been touched by their religious and philanthropic service. The miraculous survival of Josh Hansen, Matt Hansen, and Thomas Long is a tender mercy to their remaining loved ones and will hopefully bring a measure of healing for their families. Jim Hansen, Sr., spent his entire life building a legacy steeped in a strong sense of commitment to family, a touchstone to guide future generations. Being born into a family known for hard work and business acumen, as well as caring for people in need, Jim, Jr., and Kirk harnessed their entrepreneurial spirit to expand the family business into other successful ventures that had a significant impact on their home community of Idaho Falls. The success of their values and vision was manifest in the growth of their business endeavors and their global impact. Kirk and Jim were passionate about bringing hope to others, and that hope took shape in several forms. With the guidance and insight of their remarkable wives, Kirk and Jim helped found Kyani Caring Hands. For nearly a decade, this organization dedicated a significant portion of its time, energy, and financial resources to respond to disasters and support poverty-stricken [[<a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7108\">Page S7108</a>]] communities throughout the world, with a special focus on improving children's nutrition and education. The tragic plane accident that claimed the lives of these Idaho sons will forever cement the ideals and values that motivated these men to do good where good was needed. Idaho said farewell to several great men who were not only pillars of the community, but also beloved by employees everywhere. Jim Hansen, Sr., and his two sons, Kirk and Jim, Jr., were known throughout the world as men who were passionate about helping others and touching lives wherever they went. The Hansen men and children who lost their lives in this tragic plane accident will be deeply missed, but their legacy will not be forgotten.<bullet>   ", "Mr. CASSIDY": " Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the spending bill,  which we are about to vote on, which is going to increase our deficit  by almost a fourth of a trillion dollars over 10 years and of which I  think I might be the first speaker. We are going to vote on this. We  got it yesterday--Monday, maybe--and we are going to vote on it  tomorrow.  I smile because this is supposed to be the world's greatest  deliberative body, and we have not deliberated one bit on far-ranging  policies. Now, by the why, the mess is kind of bipartisan. We can  spread the blame around.  Let me bring up the heart of it. When ObamaCare passed, President  Obama famously said it would not increase the deficit by one dime. That  is gone. I think that replaces ``you can keep your doctor if you want  to'' as the greatest lie. What we did today is to repeal about $400  billion in payments to pay for all the healthcare that is going out. It  is kind of a joke on Republicans. We are getting ObamaCare, but we are  not paying for it.  On the other hand, as I will explain in a second, it may ultimately  be a joke on Democrats. Now, this concerns me because we didn't have a  committee hearing on it, and we haven't had a floor debate, but we just  committed that for almost $400 billion that have been used to fund  Medicaid expansion, people getting subsidies for their health  insurance, and many other things, we just went poof, and it is gone.  Now, some of it, like the health insurance tax, was a tax that the  insurance industry agreed to so that the Obama administration would  force ObamaCare upon the rest of us. But now that it has been agreed to  and ObamaCare is stuck, they don't want to pay the tax. They would  rather that go poof.  Now, people say: Wait a second. If we get rid of that tax, maybe  insurance premiums go down. One, they don't guarantee it, but,  secondly, what we could have done is we could have taken that money,  created reinsurance pools across the Nation, and that is estimated to  lower premiums by 10 to 20 percent. In that case, not only would the  insurance industry be fulfilling their bargain--hey, you stick the  Nation with ObamaCare, but we will help pay for it--you would actually  be able to use the money to lower premiums. That would be something  good. One, they would have kept their word, and, two, it would have  been good for the American patient, if you will.  The other tax that has gone just poof--$300 billion just gone without  debate, without deliberation, without a committee hearing, which is  still there on Friday, and today we walk in on Monday, and it is poof,  and we vote on it tomorrow, and I am the first person to speak on it-- is the so-called Cadillac tax.  Now, on the Cadillac tax, that is a provision under ObamaCare in  which for high-cost policies, if they go too high, you get taxed on  them. The whole idea is to encourage wiser purchasing of health  insurance. Now, frankly, I didn't care for the Cadillac tax. I get the  reason it was there. But 100 different economists have said that it  serves a purpose across the political spectrum. My preference is that  if we had replaced the Cadillac tax, one, we would have paid for it. We  shouldn't be getting ObamaCare without paying for it. Secondly, we  would have gotten [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7146\">Page S7146</a>, ] some reforms. They are reforms that actually would have been--if we  were not going to use the Cadillac tax to hold down the cost of  premiums--another mechanism by which we could hold down the cost of  premiums.  Why is this important? Because not only did we just go poof to almost  $400 billion, but because healthcare expenditures are driving our debt  and deficit. It is not just that we lost this $400 billion. We lost any  restraint upon policies going higher and higher.  Now, that is bad for the American patient. It is bad for the American  household because our country will continue its indebtedness.  I am a doctor. I know if you put more money into the furnace, it will  burn that much higher, and now there is just no excuse to try and rein  in those expensive policies.  It is not just that. One thing that my Republicans apparently have  agreed with Democrats on is to stop the Trump administration from  taking on something called ``silver loading.'' It is a little technical  here, but just hang with me. For the middle-class family in your State  who buys their insurance on the exchange and does not get a subsidy,  pop, there goes their premium.  How does this happen? When the Trump administration ended the  payments from the Federal Government to insurance companies, insurance  companies figured out a way around it. They are smart. They know how to  get out of taxes that they have agreed to pay for, as an example. So  they did what is called ``silver loading.'' They increased the cost of  so-called silver policies on the ObamaCare exchange. So if you are not  getting a subsidy, you are paying a lot more. But because if you are  not getting a subsidy and you are paying a lot more, that increased the  amount of subsidies for people who were. So if you are, you know,  getting a subsidy, you are probably pleased with it. If you are the  middle-class person making 400 percent of Federal poverty level and you  are paying your taxes and you are trying to do it right, you just got  stuck with a higher premium.  The administration was trying to take it on. This deal, which we have  not discussed, which was not heard in committee, which we have not  deliberated on at all, says to the administration: You can't take that  on. Yes, that middle class family not getting a subsidy is paying far  more, but you can't take it on. Stand down, administration, we are  going to stick it to that family, as well as saying poof to $400  billion.  Now, there are some other issues that are important to me in my  State. The National Flood Insurance Program is an important program. We  advanced some reforms that would make it more affordable for the  homeowner, more sustainable for society, and more accountable to the  taxpayer. We haven't had anything in there. We renewed it. I am pleased  that we renewed it.  We renewed it without reforms. You have had flooding in your State,  and I have had flooding in my State. You have had yours in yours, and I  have had it in mine. We need that program to be sustainable,  accountable, and affordable. We have lost the opportunity. I forget how  many short-term extensions we have had without reform. I think it is  like 10, 12, 14, or 16. You lose count after a while. We have missed  that opportunity.  So we started on Friday. Everybody goes home except for a few people.  They work on it over the weekend, they come in on Monday, and we get a  2,000-page bill on Monday. We will vote on it tomorrow, and I am the  first person to speak on it.  Now, I understand that impeachment is taking a lot of energy and  oxygen out of the Chambers. I understand that a lot of attention is  addressed elsewhere, but all I can say is that you have just imperiled  your country's fiscal health.  On one more thing before I wrap up, there is a little bit of an irony  here. Republicans are getting ObamaCare, but it is unpaid for. There is  another irony here as well. The courts today ruled that the individual  mandate in ObamaCare is unconstitutional. Now, I am not an attorney,  but I gather they did not rule that this was so-called severable.  If this is not constitutional, then the rest can stand because we  just sever it off. Imagine this. Imagine that the courts decide that  that portion of ObamaCare--which is related to Medicaid expansion and  is related to the exchanges in which people get subsidies to buy these  policies--is unconstitutional but would have allowed the mechanism by  which to pay for it to stand, because that is another part of the law.  We have just repealed that. Why is that important? Because if this  falls, we have to have the money to pay for a replacement.  Democrats have so long screamed that we need to have universal  access. By the way, I am a doc. I would like everybody to have  insurance. I fought for it, and I worked for it. But the other party,  which has said this is such a high priority, has just eliminated the  funding that could be used for replacement in Texas v. Azar, the court  decision that may strike down that portion of ObamaCare.  So, Republicans, we got ObamaCare that is not paid for. Democrats,  they may end up with no ObamaCare at all. Patients, whether they are on  Medicaid, getting a subsidy, or not getting a subsidy, will lose.  I hope that we can return to being the world's greatest deliberative  body, but as regards that, this has to be considered a low point.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. KENNEDY": " Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise briefly today to thank a number of  my colleagues--first, the senior Senator from Mississippi, Roger  Wicker, who has offered a bill called the 5G Spectrum Act.  I have offered a bill pertaining to the 5G spectrum, as well, and my  two Democratic friends, Senator Schatz and Senator Cantwell, have  offered a bill on that subject as well.  We have been working enthusiastically and in good faith for some time  to try to work out our differences on this legislation so that we could  pass it this calendar year. I regret that we are not going to be able  to work out our differences for the moment, but we are going to  continue our efforts in good faith.  The good news about all this legislation is that we all agree that  the FCC should conduct a public auction of the 5G spectrum.  What does that mean? We all have heard about 5G. It is  extraordinarily fast internet--100 times faster than we have right now.  But in order for 5G to work, there is a certain part of our spectrum,  or our radio waves, if you will, that the telecommunications have to  use to deliver the 5G service. It is called the C-band.  Of course, when we communicate between and among each other on the  internet or by cell phones through wireless technology, all we are  doing is sending electromagnetic radiation or radio waves from my  device to your device. It is obviously more complicated than that, but  at its fundamental level, that is what it is.  These radio waves and the airwaves through which though radio waves  travel--this electromagnetic radiation--belong to the American people.  It is called spectrum, and that is what we mean when we talk about 5G  spectrum. We can't lose sight of that fact.  The wireless telecommunication companies provide an extraordinary  service. They are going to make 5G possible with the help of the U.S.  Government and our other forms of government, but we cannot lose sight  of the fact that none of this would be possible without that spectrum,  and that is owned by the American people. That spectrum is essential.  As a result of the efforts of some swamp creatures both in and out of  government, we came that close to having this spectrum, which belongs  to the American people and is worth as much as $30 billion to $60  billion, given away in a backroom through a private auction to three  satellite companies that happen to be domiciled in foreign countries.  The excuse given was that these three foreign satellite companies can  conduct an auction themselves and allocate it to the American  telecommunication companies that need it for 5G faster than the FCC  can, even though the FCC has only conducted about 100 of these public  auctions generating about $123 billion for the American people. Why?  Because the American people own the spectrum that is being auctioned  off. It is theirs. But there was a proposal that came that close to  passing the FCC to just give this spectrum to these three companies and  let them keep the $30 to $60 billion that the spectrum auction would  have generated and let them decide who was going to get to participate  in the 5G throughout our country.  I thank the FCC. Fortunately, the FCC, at the last minute, said no,  and I want to thank them. Hence, we have the legislation by Senators  Wicker, Cantwell, Schatz, and myself, and the good news about the  legislation is that it would require a public auction by the FCC of the  spectrum that belongs to the American people. The auction [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7130\">Page S7130</a>, ] would be open to anybody who wants to bid. There would be a fair and  level playing field, and it would be conducted in front of God and  country in a public meeting. The best way to resist temptation is a  strong set of values, a proper upbringing, and witnesses. There will be  witnesses to this auction.  What we cannot agree on is how much money, if any, to give to the  foreign satellite companies. You ask: Why should we give them a dime?  Well, the foreign satellite companies, the three companies to which  this spectrum was almost given, are currently using this spectrum. They  don't need all of it. They don't even need close to all of it, but they  have been using it for a number of years. The FCC just gave it to them.  They didn't pay a dime for it.  Now, I am not criticizing. They put it to good use, but they don't  own it. They don't have a license. They have sort of a 30-day, month- to-month lease. That is the way I think of it. And the lease agreement  says that the FCC can take it back any time it wants to.  Since the satellite companies have been using the spectrum and they  have customers, we want to be fair to these companies. Certainly, when  we decide how to allocate the proceeds of the public auction in front  of God and country, which the FCC is going to conduct, we certainly  want to consider the satellite companies' interests. But I am not going  to support giving them half of the money this auction generates because  this money belongs to the American people. It can be used to extend 5G  and other forms of broadband to those of us who don't live in major  cities but happen to live in rural areas and are all still very much  Americans.  So I rise today to say thanks to Senator Wicker, and I mean that from  the bottom of my heart. I learned so much from working with him. I  thank Senators Cantwell and Schatz. We are going to keep working toward  a compromise in a way that will allocate this money to everybody fairly  and efficiently.  I am going to end as I began--that first and foremost in my mind is  the American people because the American people own this spectrum.  I don't own this spectrum. The U.S. Senate doesn't own the spectrum.  The three foreign satellite companies don't own the spectrum. The FCC  doesn't own the spectrum. The telecommunications companies, for which  we are grateful, don't own the spectrum. The American people own the  spectrum, and the vast majority of the money generated by this public  auction should go to them.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mrs. SHAHEEN": " Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to salute Walter Graff for his many years of dedicated service and forward-looking leadership at the Appalachian Mountain Club, AMC. Walter will soon retire from his role as senior vice president, the capstone to a career at AMC that began 45 years ago as a program manager in the mountains of northern New Hampshire. He leaves a legacy worthy of our praise and our gratitude. The Appalachian Mountain Club is a nearly century-and-a-half old organization with a mission of connecting people to the outdoors. Its staff and many supporters not only encourage people to explore the natural world through activities like hiking, paddling, cycling, and skiing. They are also at the forefront of conservation efforts that seek to protect our forests, mountains, rivers, and trails for future generations to enjoy and cherish. When Walter Graff was hired by the AMC in July of 1974, he spent his first months on the job screening environmental films for guests at what was then called Pinkham Notch Camp. The AMC was a much smaller organization back then with a few professional positions in New Hampshire and administrative services in Boston. But Walter had big dreams and an ambitious vision for the organization. He approached the Pinkham hutmaster at the end of the summer with the hope of developing a workshop program. He got signoff, as well as an excuse to venture outdoors. What began as a couple classes on topics like equipment maintenance and snowshoeing has since blossomed into one of the largest outdoor education programs in New England. Walter has held many titles within AMC since that summer 45 years ago. His colleagues note that his leadership has touched every facet of AMC's mission. As director of education, he was influential in launching the group's renowned outdoor skills and leadership training program. As head of the AMC's Maine Woods Initiative, he was responsible for developing a program that promotes outdoor recreation, protects natural resources, encourages responsible forestry and deepens community partnerships. To date, the program is responsible for purchasing and permanently conserving 70,000 acres of forestland and creating over 120 miles of recreational trails. As he nears his retirement, Walter is fond of looking to the past to see how much AMC has grown and how accessible our mountains, rivers, and lakes are to people across the region. He drives through the White Mountains and sees once-empty parking lots now full of people exploring the richness of the natural world. Yet Walter is also looking to the future as he approaches his final day as an AMC employee. He knows he will remain connected to the outdoors and will continue caring for the planet. On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in thanking Walter Graff for his years of service and wishing him all the best in the years ahead.<bullet>   ", "Mr. DURBIN": " Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we find ourselves in the usual December  doldrums. We are somewhere between the end of the baseball season and  the beginning of spring training. It is a time to reflect and a time to  dream.  A familiar offseason refrain from many die-hard Chicago Cubs fans is,  ``Wait `til next year'' or ``next season will be different.'' Well,  next season will indeed be different as Cubs fans will not, in the  immortal words of Steve Goodman, be able to ``catch it all on WGN.''  Chicago Cubs baseball is moving to the new Marquee Sports Network. I  want to take a moment to honor WGN's long-standing commitment to  unsurpassed sports coverage and their historic partnership with the  Cubs.  I think it is safe to say that, for the most part, Cubs fans are an  optimistic bunch. We have endured some very tough seasons and the  longest championship drought in Major League Baseball. Of course, in  2016, the Cubs rewarded their fans with a World Series championship,  the first in more than a century. Throughout much of that century, fans  could count on watching their favorite team on ``Chicago's Very Own,''  WGN-TV. In fact, for 72 years, WGN helped spread the thrills of Cubs  baseball through player milestones, including Mr. Cub Ernie Banks'  500th homerun, pennant races, October baseball, and more than a few  lean years.  The Cubs game on April 23, 1948, wasn't a particularly memorable one.  They lost 1-0 to the rival St. Louis Cardinals. History was made not on  the field but in the broadcast booth as WGN-TV aired its first Cubs  game and set in motion the longest baseball-TV relationship in baseball  history. Since then, WGN-TV has aired 7,115 Cubs games, reaching fans  across the country and around the globe.  It was a great risk for the Cubs to start airing all their games on  television. What if people stopped going to games and only watched from  home? After all, WGN-TV made it feel like you were at the game. The  Zoomar lens brought long shots and close-ups into focus as a television  cameraman swung quickly from views of the whole diamond to close-ups of  batting, pitching, and action in the bullpen. But the gamble was worth  it. The Cubs drew 1.2 million fans to Wrigley Field in 1948, despite  losing 90 games that season.  It became a tradition for kids to come home after school to watch the  Cubs on WGN. Hall of famers Ernie Banks, Billy Williams, Ron Santo, [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7195\">Page S7195</a>, ] Fergie Jenkins, Andre Dawson, Ryne Sandberg, and a host of Cubs stars  became household names to fans across the country. Many a big leaguer  today will tell stories about watching the Cubs on WGN-TV and dreaming  of playing at Wrigley Field.  Generations of fans grew up knowing the sights and sounds of WGN-TV's  Jack Brickhouse yelling, ``Hey-hey!'' or Harry Caray's ``Holy cow!''  and his famous rendition of ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game.'' Both of  these hall of famers informed, entertained, and thrilled us for decades  with their play-by-play. They dazzled in the booth even when the action  on the field fell a bit short. WGN legendary producer/director Arne  Harris was behind the scenes from the 1960s through 2001, bringing us  baseball history from Wrigley Field. A distinguished list of announcers  also graced the WGN-TV broadcast booth including Milo Hamilton, Lou  Boudreau, Vince Lloyd, and Lloyd Pettit. Today, Len Kasper and Jim  Deshaies faithfully continue that tradition and are our trusted guides  to Cubs baseball. They will continue, along with WGN-TV director of  production and author Bob Vorwald, on the new network in 2020.  I want to take this opportunity to thank WGN-TV president general  manager Paul Rennie and all the good people at WGN who brought us the  sights and sounds of the Cubs and the Friendly Confines for 72 years.  In addition to those already mentioned, we acknowledge longtime  sports editor Jack Rosenberg, who routinely pulled off the impossible  in support of the telecast; directors Chris Erskine, Jack Jacobson,  Bill Lotzer, Skip Ellison, and Marc Brady; and videographer Joe  Pausback. My friend, Shaun Sheehan, was WGN's ambassador to Washington  and to the Congress for nearly three decades. And countless assistant  directors, technical directors, camera operators, audio engineers,  video shaders, and sales, business, and station executives, including  Jim Tianis, Frank Leone, Mike Aiello, Scott Jones, Steve Casey, Mike  Clay, Mark Stencel, Marty Wilke, Errol Gerber, Marissa Rudman, Jake  Fendley, Mark Boe, Jeff Shaw, Ward Quaal, Joe Loughlin, Dennis  FitzSimons, Peter Walker, John Vitanovec, Tom Ehlmann, Greg Easterly,  Jim Dowdle, Sheldon Cooper, Jim Zerwekh, Bob Ramsey, Tom Boyd, and  Terry ``Whitey'' Pearson truly made Cubs baseball on WGN-TV special.  As Bob Vorwald said just before the final games on WGN, ``We want to  tip our hat to Jack Brickhouse and Harry Caray and all the people that  have announced and the thousands of men and women that have worked on  the games. But, the best way to do that is by having a great telecast.  That's always been our mission, and it's important that we uphold that  to the very end.''  As WGN-TV and all the people who made Chicago Cubs baseball telecasts  possible sign off, let me join the countless fans in thanking them for  creating an American standard of broadcasting excellence.

Mr. President, this month we recognize the 100th  anniversary of the founding of the American Meteorological Society,  AMS, which spent the last century advancing the atmospheric and related  sciences. The work of AMS contributed to technologies and services that  expand our understanding of the world and the risks associated with our  water, weather, and climate.  AMS was founded in 1919 in Milton, MA, to advance, promote, and  disseminate information about these important sciences. The society now  has over 13,000 members, including researchers, educators, students,  enthusiasts, broadcasters, and other professionals in weather, water,  and climate. Its rigorously peer-reviewed scientific publications and  scientific conferences have contributed to knowledge growth across the  geosciences, especially in the prediction of environmental phenomena  that has led to lifesaving services. AMS also offers nationally  recognized certifications that serve the public's need to identify  broadcast and consulting meteorologists who have achieved a high level  of competency in communicating complex weather, water, and climate  information.  AMS has been a leader in promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion  in the science, technology, engineering, and math STEM fields. Its  activities in support of STEM education and development activities for  K-12 teachers have positively impacted millions of students nationwide.  Its leadership in education also brings AMS to the Halls of Congress,  where the society supports congressional fellows, research studies on  environmental policy, and policy briefings to ensure that policies are  developed using the best available knowledge and understanding.  AMS has also been crucial in developing the extensive scientific  evidence of manmade climate change and has helped us understand the  threat it poses to society if we do not act. AMS has been an  international leader in providing peer-reviewed information to support  evidence-based decision making related to climate change. Congress owes  a debt of gratitude to AMS for its advocacy and education on this  global threat.  With the scope and size of the challenge that climate change  presents, Congress and the American people will undoubtedly depend on  another successful century of leadership and scientific advancements  from the American Meteorological Society. We congratulate and thank AMS  for its century-long effort to understand the natural world, and we  pledge our continued support to the important sciences AMS aims to  advance.

Madam President, today I rise with a heavy heart to honor and pay tribute to three exemplary National Guard Members from my home State of Minnesota. On Thursday, December 5, SGT Kort M. Plantenberg, CW2 James A. Rogers, Jr., and CW2 Charles P. Nord lost their lives when their Black Hawk UH-60 helicopter went down southwest of St. Cloud, MN, during a routine maintenance flight. They had just returned home from the Middle East in May after a 9- month deployment conducting medical evacuations. Once back in Minnesota, they had continued serving our Nation by ensuring that our Forces would be prepared to respond the moment they were needed. After this tragic loss, Governor Walz, a Minnesota National Guardsman for nearly 25 years, remarked that ``we will forever be in the debt of these warriors.'' I couldn't agree more. Today, I would like to honor these brave men for giving what President Lincoln called, ``the last full measure of devotion.'' We are forever grateful for heroes like Sergeant Plantenberg, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Rogers, and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Nord. Some who knew these extraordinary men described Sergeant Plantenberg as ``one of the most professional individuals . . . [who] had unlimited potential.'' Chief Warrant Officer 2 Rogers was said to be a ``calming presence'' who could always make those around him laugh. Chief Warrant Officer 2 Nord was described as ``lighthearted--and kind-hearted.'' Like many who serve this country, these men all had so many gifts, and our Nation is better today because of their service and sacrifice. During this time of unimaginable grief, I would also like to offer my prayers and condolences to the families of these fallen heroes. I hope they take comfort in the fact that their lives weren't lost in vain but in support of their common goal: to serve the Nation they loved. They will be missed, but never forgotten, as their service has inspired us all. So now, it is up to us to preserve their memory and support all of our brave men and women who make such an immense sacrifice to keep our Nation strong. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones and with the entire Minnesota National Guard community, at home and overseas. There is no limit to the respect they have earned, no cap to the honor they are due, and no time when we will not be in their debt. Thank you.<bullet>   ", "Mr. BENNET": " Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wanted to spend a few moments to  recognize my colleague and friend, Senator Isakson from Georgia.  When I first came to the Senate in 2009--a decade ago, it surprises  me to say--I was on the Banking Committee. We were in the middle of the  worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and millions of  Americans were losing their homes each month.  We held a hearing on housing, and I remember Senator Isakson coming  to testify because, before he was in politics, he had spent several  years in the private sector working in real estate. I appreciated that  moment because, one, I had also spent some time in business before  politics, and two, because it was so refreshing to hear from someone  who actually knew what they were talking about.  Over the past 10 years, I have had the benefit of Senator Isakson's  experience, friendship, and wisdom on both the HELP and Finance  Committees.  In Johnny, so many of us have had a model for how to get things done  even in this moment of partisan division. He was a welcome throwback to  a time when people didn't come to this town just to spend every moment  on cable news but to get things done for the people they came here to  represent.  Johnny's record suggests there is nothing quaint or naive about that  approach to the work because over his 15 years in the Senate, he has  managed to secure quite a few bipartisan accomplishments, including  several things we have worked on together.  I remember Johnny really digging in and getting his hands dirty on  the SAVE Act, our bill to make Federal mortgage loan agencies consider  the returns from energy efficiency when they determine your ability to  make your monthly payments. We passed that out of the Senate, and it  was a [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7201\">Page S7201</a>, ] tremendous credit to Johnny's determination and focus.  We passed a bill to modernize the FDA's medical device inspections  and to strengthen patient access to rehabilitation hospitals in  Colorado and Georgia. We passed an amendment to strengthen funding for  early learning programs. And we introduced bills together to provide  tax relief for AmeriCorps members who earned Segal Awards to help pay  for college.  I could go on, and it is a credit to Johnny's broad record of  bipartisan work.  Johnny has been a particular champion for our veterans. As a former  member of the Georgia Air National Guard, Johnny has been a steady and  effective advocate for those who have served. Last year, he was  instrumental in passing a bipartisan bill to make it far easier for  veterans to take their benefits to private doctors for care, among  other long-overdue reforms. With our large population of veterans in  Colorado, we were especially grateful to Johnny for his leadership.  There is a lot more I could share, but the point is, Johnny has used  his time here well--with real results for the people of Georgia. He  didn't do it through bullying or shouting or threatening to bring the  Senate to its knees if he didn't get his way. He did it Johnny's way-- with unfailing kindness, grace, humor, and dogged persistence. It would  be easy to mistake Johnny's kindness for a lack of intensity or  determination, but behind his easy smile is a fierce devotion to  Georgia and a welcome impatience with the inaction of this town.  That approach is how Johnny leaves this body not only with a  considerable record of accomplishment but with a long list of admirers  on both sides of the aisle who are now wondering who is going to host  the annual bipartisan BBQ. We are sad to see him go, and we wish him  all the best as he returns to Georgia to focus on his health and spend  time with his wife, Diane, their three kids and eight grandkids.  Johnny, I wish you the very best. Know that the Senate will feel your  absence and cherish the example you set here.    ", "Mr. JONES": " Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I want to first thank Senator Inhofe and  Senator Reed and their staff for their amazing work on this National  Defense Authorization Act. What we are about to accomplish is truly  remarkable, not only for America but for individuals and families.  I am rising today as grateful and as humbled as I could ever imagine  being in this Senate Chamber, but I am also just the opposite--I am  excited like a kid at Christmas waiting to have the final passage of  this because it means so much. We are at the finish line, about to run  through the tape in a race, a marathon that so many folks thought we  could never finish. I am talking about this momentous and historic  National Defense Authorization Act upon which we are about to vote and  pass in just a few moments.  The NDAA includes so many of our collective priorities to bolster the  defense of our Nation, to modernize our military, and to take care of  our servicemembers and their families. But included very deep within  this incredibly thick piece of legislation is a provision that has been  repeatedly introduced over the past 18 years, but it has never gotten  across that finish line. I am speaking about the Military Widow's Tax  Elimination Act.  For the past four decades, the military widow's tax has prevented  surviving military spouses from receiving the full benefits they are  owed by the U.S. Government. Legislation to repeal this unfair law has  been repeatedly introduced in Congress for the last 18 years, but money  and budgets and points of order have always won out over the commitment  we have made to these families. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7068\">Page S7068</a>, ]  When I introduced it with my friend and colleague Senator Collins  earlier this year, we knew it was going to be an uphill battle. We knew  that the fight had been going on for so long and that we faced a steep  climb, but we took a great deal of strength and motivation from the  impacted widows themselves who have fought and advocated for this bill  for nearly two decades. They have been a regular presence on Capitol  Hill, asking year after year for Members of Congress to lend an ear to  their cause. I was heartbroken when one of them told me they felt like  they were easy to brush off because they were ``just a bunch of little  old ladies.''  I was heartbroken when Cathy Milford said every time she came up here  it was like digging up her husband and burying him all over again.  After 18 years without success, yet all the while being told how  supportive Members of Congress are for their service and sacrifice,  time and time again, you could see how disheartening that might be when  they would go home emptyhanded.  So when I told them this was the year--Senator Collins and I had made  it our mission that this was going to be the year we were finally going  to get this done--there were more than a few of them who were  skeptical, but they were, of course, always optimistic.  We knew we had to fight harder than ever before if we were going to  be successful. We had to make our case that this injustice could no  longer stand. As we did, one by one, Senators and Members of the House  joined this cause with us. By summertime, in this body, we had earned  an unprecedented number of Senators' support for this bill.  Today, as we are about to vote, there are over three-fourths of the  U.S. Senate who have cosponsored this legislation. Think of that. In  such a partisan time as we live in right now, in this moment, three- fourths of the U.S. Senate has voiced their support.  Because of the momentum we built, this is the year, this is the day,  we will finally honor the commitment we made to these families who have  given everything to our country. This is the year, this is the day, we  will let our actions speak louder than words, the year we finally put  our money where our mouth is when it comes to honoring our  servicemembers and their families. This is the year, this is the day,  we finally repeal the widow's tax once and for all.  It is, to be candid, difficult to articulate what it means to me to  be able to help bring this legislation across the finish line for these  surviving spouses.  Their strength, their devotion, and their grit have made this all  possible. Their loved ones gave what Abraham Lincoln called ``the last  full measure of devotion'' to our country, and the continued commitment  to that devotion by their surviving spouses is a daily reminder of why  I am here, why we are all here.  In their own way, these widows have also fought to advance the ideals  and values of the Nation we all love so much. Instead of becoming  bitter or jaded when learning of this injustice, these incredible women  worked to make things right. Year after year, they would gather in  Washington to meet with Members of the House and the Senate to beg  Congress to right this wrong, only to be told that as unfair as this  may be, eliminating the widow's tax would just cost us too much. For 18  years, they were told it could never get done, but they never ever gave  up.  It kind of reminds me of a movie that was one of my favorite movies  years ago called ``Network,'' in which the late actor Peter Finch  starred as a somewhat crazed newscaster who was so fed up with the  state of affairs in this country that he implored all those watching to  go to their windows and throw open the windows and just yell: ``I'm mad  as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore,'' and they did.  That is essentially what these widows did as well. Year after year,  they screamed that they were not going to take it anymore, and they  built momentum that led to this historic vote today.  I am so glad this fight is finally coming to an end. I am going to  miss their regular visits and their friendship. I truly hope they know  how much it has meant to me and my staff as well. My staff has been all  in. Everybody has been so dedicated and so passionate about getting  this across the finish line.  I am deeply grateful to Senators Inhofe and Reed, who have been  critical to this effort to get this done. Without them, it would not  have been possible. For their support, I am truly appreciative.  More important, I am especially grateful to my partner in all of  this, Senator Collins, whose deeply held commitment was vital to our  success.  Today we will celebrate the end to our four-decades-old fight. We  will take stock in this great achievement together, but tomorrow we  must turn our attention to the next big issue because there are so many  others who need our help, our attention, and our courage to do the  right thing.  For now--for now we can celebrate because today those military  spouses who had once proclaimed they were mad as hell and not going to  take it are watching this proceeding with a more joyous feeling. These  widows are watching in the quiet of their homes, perhaps in the  Gallery, many of them grasping a photograph of their loved ones, their  late husbands, but they all have tears in their eyes, saying to each  other and to us in this body: Thank you because now I am happy as hell  that I don't have to take it anymore.  I assure my colleagues that right now their spouses, those who gave  the ultimate sacrifice for this country, are watching from that  heavenly perch above, standing at full attention, and saluting the  Members of this Congress and saying: Thank you. Thank you for  recognizing the ultimate sacrifice I made for this country. Thank you  because you have demonstrated a commitment to me and my service, and  with that final commitment from you, the commitment I made to my loved  ones, the commitment to care for them even after I am gone, has finally  been fulfilled, and I can truly rest in peace.  To my colleagues in the Senate, by your vote today, you are doing so  much more than modernizing our military providing for the Nation's  defense. By your vote today, you are returning their salute--the salute  to those brave servicemembers who gave their all in service to this  country.  Folks, this is a really, really big deal, and I salute all the  Members of this body for their efforts.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mrs. FEINSTEIN": " Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the resolution that  Senator McSally and I introduced to declare January as ``National One  Health Awareness Month.''  ``One Health'' is a term used by health experts--including those at  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--to focus on the  connections between human, animal, and environmental health.  Our resolution will help raise awareness for the ``One Health''  approach and promote efforts that simultaneously improve the health of  people, animals, plants, and the environment.  By using the One Health approach, global health problems including  antibiotic resistance, infectious disease spread, and sequestered  medical knowledge can be addressed.  Antibiotic resistance is of grave concern for both people and  animals. Public health specialists are working with physicians and  veterinarians to minimize inappropriate antibiotic usage in their  patients.  By 2050, according to the United Kingdom's 2014 Review on  Antimicrobial Resistance, experts expect that more people will die from  antibiotic resistant microbes than die from cancer today. The best way  to solve this growing problem is for specialists across a variety of  disciplines to collaborate to reduce antibiotic use by promoting good  sanitation and developing alternatives for antibiotics.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up to 75  percent of new or emerging infectious diseases in people are spread by  animals. Examples include Ebola, Zika, Rabies, Tuberculosis, and  Plague. By destroying natural animal habitats through deforestation,  natural disasters, and climate change, we are forcing animals and  insects to migrate to new areas, thereby exposing humans to new  diseases.  In 2013, a two-year-old boy was the first victim of the Ebola  epidemic in Western Africa. In his small village, deforestation forced  the bats suspected of carrying the Ebola virus to move closer to  people.  Collaboration between physicians, nurses, physician assistants,  nurse's aids, veterinarians, hygienists, anthropologists,  epidemiologists, community engagement specialists, and military workers  helped end the Ebola epidemic by attacking it from different angles.  This was an example of One Health in action. Today, a similar  collaborative approach is working to end the current Ebola epidemic in  Central Africa.  In the United States, diseases such as Lyme disease, Anaplasma,  Bartonella, and Zika carried by ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes,  respectively, are also spreading to new areas.  In 2015, an 11-year-old Louisiana boy was accidently scratched by a  kitten with fleas. He was misdiagnosed by more than thirty doctors and  he became wheelchairbound. However, a ``One Health'' approach saved his  life. The boy was finally correctly diagnosed with a bacterial disease  acquired by the kitten's scratch once he met with a medical team that  included both a physician and a veterinarian. The veterinarian  understood that fleas can give cats bacteria and the physician  understood that a cat's scratch can transmit the bacteria to humans.  The boy was prescribed the antibiotics he needed, and he can now walk  again.  It is time that everybody understands the importance of One Health.  With diminishing resources in the environment and a growing human  population, now more than ever, fighting problems with a One Health  approach must be encouraged.  Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.    ", "Ms. COLLINS": " Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:37 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, December 23, 2019, at 10 a.m.    ", "Mr. BLUMENTHAL": " Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Dan Freedman on the occasion of his retirement. Throughout his impressive 32 years as a correspondent in the Hearst Washington Bureau, Dan set an example of tireless, honest reporting. He undertook the monumental task of covering the Connecticut and New York delegations with rigor and expertise. Even as the media environment grows more [[<a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7205\">Page S7205</a>]] partisan, Dan has remained fair and dedicated to the facts. Dan has helped build an essential professional foundation for countless reporters, mentoring hundreds of newcomers and interns and holding everyone--including himself--to the highest standards. Regarded with immense respect by his colleagues, he routinely challenged himself in order to set a better example for his team and raise the expectations for outstanding reporting. In DC, legislators trust Dan to deliver a truthful and balanced story. This integrity is essential for the people of Connecticut who rely on reporters like Dan to inform them about the Nation's Capital with a focus on the stories that matter most to them and their communities. Constituents need to know their voices are being heard, and Dan is there to ask the tough questions and to deliver the most complete and honest reporting possible. During an over four-decade career in journalism, Dan did it all-- everything from dodging bullets in wars and insurrections in Central America to covering eight Supreme Court confirmation hearings and even a stint on the George W. Bush Presidential campaign in 2000. His unfailing commitment to his profession was recognized in 2018, when he won the David Lynch Memorial Award for Regional Reporting. Dan's outstanding record of thoughtful, honest, and determined reporting sets a model and demonstrates the critical role of reporters in keeping people throughout the country well informed. I applaud his lifetime of dogged devotion to bringing the truth to light through fair, fact-filled pieces, and I know my colleagues will join me in thanking Dan for his extraordinary contributions to regional reporting.<bullet>   ", "Mr. DAINES": " Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week I have the honor of recognizing Charlotte Kinnoman of Lake County for her dedication to Montana's first responders during Christmas. When Charlotte met a law enforcement officer at an event with her family, she learned of the sacrifices our first responders make to protect Montana's families and communities. After that meeting, and at just 12 years old, Charlotte decided she wanted to give back to our first responders. She has been writing 125 Christmas cards a day to give to every first responder she meets. She even has a goal of writing 12,000 total. Charlotte's mom and classmates have also been helpful in writing Christmas cards to make sure they are spreading holiday cheer all across Big Sky Country. I commend Charlotte for her compassion. Charlotte is a great role model for all young Montanans, and I thank her for supporting our first responders this Christmas season.<bullet>   ", "Mr. REED": " Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the fiscal year 2020  National Defense Authorization Act. After several weeks of debate and  negotiation, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have  completed the conference report, which addresses critical issues facing  our military and our country's national security.  I would like to thank Senator Inhofe, Chairman Smith, and Ranking  Member Thornberry for their thoughtfulness, hard work, and cooperation  throughout the process.  This was not an easy conference. There were many difficult issues and  differences of opinion that had to be worked through. I think it is  safe to say that many have misgivings about one provision or another,  but there are so many other positive provisions that many will consider  a legislative successes, in my view. That is the art of compromise.  Overall, it is a very good conference report that helps the military  and the American people. Last week, this conference report passed by a  vote of 379 to 48 in the House, and I hope it will have the same strong  support in the Senate.  As we consider the conference report, I would like to highlight  several areas that I am particularly pleased with and address several  items that have been of concern to some Members.  In accordance with the budget agreement, the NDAA conference report  authorizes $658.4 billion for the Department of Defense and national  security programs of the Department of Energy, $71.5 billion for  overseas contingency operations, and $5.3 billion in emergency funding  to restore installations that were damaged by extreme weather and  natural disasters.  The conference report includes a number of important provisions to  support our servicemembers, their families, and the civilian employees  of the Department of Defense who support them, including a 3.1-percent  pay raise for troops and the authorization of a number of bonus,  special, and incentive pays to encourage enlistment and reenlistment in  the Armed Forces.  We continue our efforts to eliminate sexual harassment and assault in  our military. Over the last 12 years, we have legislated nearly 200  changes in law to combat sexual assault. In this conference report, we  direct the Comptroller General to assess the implementation and  effectiveness of these requirements.  We also include a number of new provisions to continue our fight  against this scourge, including increasing investigative resources to  expedite investigations, increasing access to Victims' Legal Counsel  and Victim Witness Program liaisons to support survivors of sexual  assault, requiring additional training for commanders, and requiring  more transparency with sexual assault survivors about the progress of  court-martial and administrative processes. We also include new  provisions to more effectively address domestic violence and child  exploitation. We cannot rest. We must continue to insist that we do all  we can to prevent this scourge from permeating our military forces.  The conference report also includes the Fair Chance Act, which  ensures that applicants for positions in the Federal Government and  with Federal contractors are treated fairly by restricting requests for  criminal background information until the conditional offer stage.  As everyone is aware, the conference report includes 12 weeks of paid  parental leave for the Federal civilian workforce, an important benefit  that will help the Federal Government recruit and retain the very best  civilian talent.  The conference report authorizes a number of important Army and Air  Force programs. The final bill supports funding for 73 UH-6M Blackhawks  and 48 AH-64 Apache helicopters in the Army.  In addition, the conference bill authorizes an additional $75.6  million to accelerate the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft Program,  which is a top modernization priority for the U.S. Army. The agreement  also fully supports upgrading 165 Abrams tanks and includes an  additional $249.2 million to integrate a medium caliber weapon system  onto the Stryker platform. This was an unfunded armor requirement which  we were able to meet.  With regard to the Air Force, the conference report includes $1  billion for 12 additional F-35A aircraft, which was an unfunded  requirement for the Air Force, as well as $392 million for 4 additional  C-130J aircraft to support increased inter-theater airlift capability.  The bill also includes language that extends the Department's authority  to protect critical facilities and assets from unauthorized operation  of unmanned aircraft. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7066\">Page S7066</a>, ]  I am pleased the conference agreement includes key provisions and  authorizes critical funding that will strengthen naval readiness and  submarine production. This conference report reaffirms that we must  maintain a minimum of 11 aircraft carriers to protect our national  interests around the world and authorizes the first year appropriations  for the midlife refueling of the USS Harry S. Truman.  It continues the construction of two Virginia-class submarines per  year and supports the nine-boat multiyear contract, with an option for  a tenth boat, that the Navy and Electric Boat signed earlier this  month.  The report also supports full funding for the Columbia-class  ballistic missile submarine.  I am particularly pleased that the conference agreement also  authorizes additional funding to continue to support the expansion of  the submarine industrial business, as well as workforce development.  The conference report further bolsters maritime sealift and  mobilization by reauthorizing the Maritime Administration, including  authorizing a new cable security fleet program and requiring the  Secretary of the Navy to seek to enter into a contract for additional  sealift vessels.  Finally, in order to keep our existing ships ready for deployment,  the conference agreement authorizes additional funding for Navy ship  and submarine depot maintenance to ensure key shipyard availabilities  are not further delayed due to the existing maintenance backlog.  The conference agreement authorizes full funding for the President's  request to continue modernizing our nuclear deterrence and its triad of  delivery platforms, which are rapidly aging out. This modernization  effort began in 2010 and will continue for the next 15 to 20 years. Our  ballistic submarines will begin to age out in the 2030s. Our heavy  bombers will be replaced in the 2040s, after having served for over 80  years. And our ICBMs will start to be replaced in the 2030s, after  having been on alert 24/7, 365-days a year, for over 60 years.  On the issue of low-yield nuclear weapons, while I opposed the  deployment of the low-yield submarine ballistic missile in last year's  bill and supported the provision in this year's House bill, which again  would have prohibited deployment, that provision was not included in  this year's conference report. I maintain that this is one weapon that  will not add to our national security but would only increase the risk  of miscalculation with dire consequences, and regret the House  provision was not included in the House report.  Perhaps the most bipartisan topic in the fiscal year 2020 NDAA was  privatized housing reform. Over 30 provisions were included to help the  Defense Department reinvigorate its oversight of housing companies.  Over the last year, the Armed Service Committee received hundreds of  calls for help directly from military families. Their stories of  hardship, photos of substandard home conditions, and reports of  nonresponsive customer service by the housing companies spurred this  comprehensive package of reforms.  While this will likely not be the last NDAA to address housing  problems, the fiscal year 2020 bill makes a significant first step in  several key areas. For example, we begin by requiring several standards  in the ``tenant bill of rights.''  We ensure that DOD has a single individual in charge of privatized  housing and, in the event housing companies are found to be responsible  for causing medical problems, there will be a way for families to be  compensated appropriately. Families will now be guaranteed access to  work order systems and see what kind of home they are inhabiting prior  to moving in, much like consumers get a Carfax report before they buy a  used car. Companies must now disclose their bonus structures, document  a complaint database made by families online, and are prohibited from  forcing families to sign nondisclosure agreements.  The DOD must also create and implement a standardized formal dispute  resolution process and a uniform lease across all installations.  We still have a long way to go as a Congress to ensure military  families are getting the kinds of quality homes and living conditions  they deserve, but the fiscal year 2020 NDAA sets everyone on the right  path, and we will continue to be watching both DOD and the housing  companies.  In another area of importance to the safety of all families, after  too many years of status quo, the NDAA includes a number of new  authorities and requirements for the DOD to confront its use of toxic  PFAS chemicals. While we were ultimately unable to reach an agreement  with the House establishing new regulations through the Safe Drinking  Water Act and other substantial improvements, like cleanup via CERCLA  and declarations of hazardous substances, the NDAA does make a number  of new changes. For example, the Department of Defense must phase out  the use of PFAS in firefighting foams on its installations. The bill  restores the National Guard's access to defense environmental  restoration accounts, presses DOD to enter cooperative agreements with  local entities contaminated by PFAS chemicals, and extends the ongoing  CDC human health study of PFAS in drinking water.  With respect to countering the continued threat by ISIS, the bill  extends the train-and-equip programs that underpin our partnerships  with the Syrian defense forces and Iraqi security forces, while  ensuring appropriate congressional oversight of the use of such funds.  Specific to Iraq, the bill also begins to normalize security  assistance to Iraq by transitioning funding to enduring authorities.  The conference report also includes the bipartisan Caesar Syria  Civilian Protection Act, which is intended to help facilitate an end to  the conflict in Syria and hold responsible those who have perpetrated  war crimes. Specifically, the bill sanctions foreign persons who  knowingly provide significant financial, material, or technological  support to or knowingly engage in a significant transaction with the  Syrian Government and authorizes the Secretary of State to provide  support to entities conducting criminal investigations, supporting  prosecutions, or collecting evidence against those who have committed  war crimes or crimes against humanity in Syria.  With regard to Afghanistan, the bill extends several authorities to  train and equip the Afghanistan National Defense and Security Forces.  It also authorizes the Department of Defense to provide support for  bottom-up, Governor of Afghanistan-led reconciliation activities and  mandates that the Secretary of State, in coordination with the  Secretary of Defense, advocate for the inclusion of Afghan women in  ongoing future negotiations to end the conflict in Afghanistan. It is  in the interest of all parties to forge a negotiated settlement that  brings this conflict to a close while also protecting U.S. security  interests and basic human rights.  The bill also includes 4,000 additional special immigrant visas and  the extension of the SIV Program so we can continue to honor  commitments made to our wartime allies in Afghanistan.  As recent press reports indicate, after almost 18 years of combat and  capacity building, Afghan military and political institutions are  fragile, and the Taliban remains a serious threat. Moreover, terrorist  groups like al-Qaida and ISIS continue to pose a potential threat to  the region and beyond. The Armed Services Committee and other  committees of jurisdiction must undertake a comprehensive evaluation of  the causes of the current situation and help facilitate a thoughtful  way ahead.  The conference report also contains a number of provisions to address  the continuing threat of foreign malign influence from Russia and  others countries. Deterring and countering this threat to our democracy  is critical ahead of the 2020 Presidential elections.  The bill requires an update to our strategy for countering Russian  malign influence, which needs to be better coordinated across U.S.  Government Departments and Agencies, and expands that strategy to cover  China, Iran, and other malign actors.  To guard against malign foreign actors seeking to gain access to  sensitive information through DOD contractors, the conference report  includes a provision that I sponsored to enhance requirements for DOD  contractors and [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7067\">Page S7067</a>, ] subcontractors to disclose beneficial ownership information, including  whether companies are subject to foreign ownership, control, or  influence.  The Intelligence authorization bill, which is part of the conference  report, also includes key provisions to counter foreign malign  influence that have been of particular interest to me.  First, it authorizes establishing a Foreign Malign Influence Response  Center, which would bring together all elements of the intelligence  community and serve as a primary organization for analyzing and  integrating intelligence on foreign malign influence to provide a  common operating picture across the government.  The Intelligence authorization bill also authorizes the Director of  National Intelligence to facilitate the establishment of an  independent, nonprofit, Social Media Data and Threat Analysis Center to  bring tech companies and researchers together to analyze indicators of  foreign adversary threat networks across social media platforms.  Finally, the conference report authorizes funds for research on  foreign malign influence trends and indicators, including on foreign  weaponization of ``deepfakes''--that is, videos or other media that is  digitally manipulated by foreign governments to spread disinformation.  Turning to Ukraine, the conference report authorizes an increase in  funding for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative to provide  critical aid, including lethal assistance, to this strategic partner to  defend itself against Russian aggression against its sovereignty and  territorial integrity.  With respect to Turkey, the conference report prohibits Turkey's  participation in the F-35 aircraft program as long as it possesses the  Russian S-400 air defense system. It expresses the sense of Congress  that Turkey's purchase of the S-400 system triggers congressionally  mandated sanctions and urges the administration to impose those  sanctions, which are long overdue.  As everyone is aware, this conference report does create a sixth  service within the Air Force for a Space Force. Its mission will be to  deter hostile actions in space against the United States and its  allies.  I would note that the organization created in this conference report  is far more robust than was originally passed in the Senate bill. I  believe this bill may be trying to do too much, too fast, and will  require significant oversight. That being said, I do believe the  attention we have paid to space and protecting our national security  assets in space is vitally important. I will continue to work on this  issue in the coming years.  Finally, with respect to substantive provisions, I would like to  touch on an issue I find very problematic. I am deeply disappointed  that, despite my strong support, provisions intended to prohibit U.S.  involvement in the civil war in Yemen, including arms transfers to the  Saudi-led coalition, are not included in the conference report. The  civil war in Yemen is the world's worst ongoing humanitarian crisis,  and the administration should be playing a more active and constructive  role in ending the conflict and achieving a sustainable peace.  I strongly support a prohibition on offensive arms transfers and  other offensive support for the Saudi-led coalition and will continue  working to stop the bloodshed and suffering in Yemen.  We must redouble our efforts in support of the Yemeni people and  increase humanitarian assistance. Iran, al-Qaida, ISIS, and others  continue to benefit from the chaos of this protracted conflict, and  ending the war is in the long-term security interests of both the  United States and Saudi Arabia.  Stronger U.S. support for peace talks can and should set the  conditions for Yemenis to negotiate a durable peace and for the  international community to begin the difficult but critical work of  restoring stability and basic services to the people of Yemen. These  objectives will remain significant priorities going forward.  Let me conclude by again thanking Senator Inhofe for his superb  leadership and Chairman Smith for his superb leadership of the  conference, which is a very challenging responsibility. They discharged  it with great skill. I also thank Ranking Member Mac Thornberry, who  was extraordinarily thoughtful and professional in his deportment, and  all the conferees for their bipartisan support throughout the process.  This process has been collegial and has been an example of a strong  piece of legislation that addresses concerns of Members on both sides  of the aisle.  I would also like to thank the staffs of the Senate Armed Services  Committee and the House Armed Services Committee for all their fine  work on drafting a thoughtful and comprehensive bill. Their diligent  work throughout the NDAA process has been integral in producing the  strong bill before us today.  Let me say this: They are not identified enough, in my view. The work  they did and continue to do has been superb--absolutely superb. I want  to personally thank them. Let me thank John Bonsell, Elizabeth King,  Jen Stewart, and Paul Arcangeli for their help. They are the staff  directors of the committees in both the House and the Senate.  If my colleagues would bear with me, I want to recognize all of our  staff members because they don't get the credit they deserve.

Thank you.  I strongly support this conference agreement and hope that it will  receive the support of my colleagues in the Senate.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. ROUNDS": " Mr. ROUNDS. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    ", "Mr. MERKLEY": " Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I wish to state for the record that  although an important engagement in Oregon kept me from being present  in the Capitol to participate in the cloture vote on this year's  National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, I would have voted nay had I  been present.  I am pleased that the NDAA would phase out the reduction of survivor  benefit plan annuities to ensure that the families of our fallen  servicemembers receive the Federal support they need and deserve; would  guarantee 12 weeks of paid family leave for Federal employees; fence  funds for the introduction of new Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces,  INF; limit nuclear cooperation agreements under section 123 of the U.S.  Atomic Energy Act with countries that lack safeguards; and support the  legally-binding and verifiable limits of the New START Treaty as being  in the national security interest of the United States. However, other  aspects of the bill are cause for serious concern, outweighing these  strong points, and must not be overlooked.  I am deeply concerned by this legislation's failure to prohibit funds  for unauthorized war with Iran. There is no doubt that war with Iran  would be a reckless, disastrous mistake. Yet the President has made a  number of impulsive, provocative public statements that risk escalating  tensions. Congress must protect its authority to declare war, and that  means no blank checks to the administration for an unauthorized war  with Iran.  It is also unthinkable that the final NDAA does not prohibit funds  for intelligence support to the Saudi-led coalition in a war that has  caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Communities have  crumbled as a result of this conflict, and an acute cholera outbreak  and famine have killed more than 85,000 children under the age of 5.  The United States has no place supporting, prolonging, or being  complicit in this war's widespread civilian casualties.  In addition, I am concerned that the NDAA does not prohibit funds for  the deployment of a low-yield warhead on a submarine-launched ballistic  missile. The use of this powerful and aggressive tool could drastically  increase the risk of instigating a destabilizing nuclear arms race. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7090\">Page S7090</a>, ]  Here at home, the final NDAA conference report removed provisions to  address PFAS water contamination. More than 16 million Americans  currently drink water contaminated with PFAS chemicals, which can  affect every major organ in the human body and put humans at higher  risk of a wide variety of health conditions and complications including  liver and kidney damage and thyroid disease. The decision to reject  remedies to this urgent public health issue in the NDAA is deeply  disturbing and completely unacceptable.  Finally, this NDAA does not include adequate safeguards to ensure  accountability for wasteful defense spending. At a time when America  far outspends every other nation in the world militarily, while working  families are grappling with stagnant wages and rising costs of living,  it could not be more important that the Pentagon and its contractors  are accountable to American taxpayers. We should be doing far more to  scrutinize defense spending and to evaluate whether we could maintain a  strong military while redirecting badly needed funding to the American  people's priorities on health care, housing, education, and  infrastructure.  Mr. President, I wish to state once again that I would have voted nay  had I been present. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues  to resolve these critical issues in future bills and to advance the  health, safety, and well-being of all Americans.    ", "Mr. CASEY": " Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of 1LT  Michael Cleary from Dallas, PA. It has been 14 years since his death.  Michael is one of some 288 Pennsylvanians killed in action in the wars  in Iraq and Afghanistan.  First Lieutenant Cleary served as platoon leader of the Explosive  Ordnance Disposal Team in E Company, 1st of the 15th Regiment, 3rd  Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division of the U.S. Army.  On December 20, 2005, First Lieutenant Cleary was killed in action  while working in a bomb factory near Samarra, Iraq. His platoon was  ambushed outside the facility. He was just 24 years old.  Even prior to joining the Army, Michael Cleary was an active member  of his community. He graduated from Dallas Senior High School in  Dallas, PA, and was a 4-year varsity athlete in both soccer and tennis.  He was captain of both teams in his senior year. He received the Dr.  Pepper Soccer MVP Scholarship and a history scholarship at high school  graduation and was offered academic scholarships at Ursinus College,  Gettysburg, as well as Dickinson and Lafayette--all very strong  academic institutions of higher education in Pennsylvania.  He followed his father's footsteps and chose Hamilton College in New  York. While at Hamilton, First Lieutenant Cleary participated in  varsity soccer and lettered in varsity tennis. After the September 11,  2001, attacks on our Nation, he wanted to enlist in the Special Forces  but chose to follow the advice of his mother and stayed in school until  completing his studies.  In May 2003, he graduated from Hamilton with honors. During his  senior year, he applied to and was accepted into the Marine flight  officer program. He was notified that his class would be deferred until  January. Not wanting to wait any longer to serve his country, Michael  Cleary decided to enlist in the U.S. Army. Three weeks after college  graduation, he went to basic training and earned his airborne wings and  sapper tab and graduated from the Special Air Service Antiterrorist  Course.  The news of First Lieutenant Cleary's death came just before he was  scheduled to return home during the Christmas season. He was also  planning to get married 2 months after he returned home to his high  school sweetheart. First Lieutenant Cleary earned the following awards  and decorations: the Army Achievement Medal, National Defense Service  Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army  Service Ribbon, and Overseas Service Ribbon. His family also received  First Lieutenant Cleary's U.S. Army Bronze Star and Purple Heart.  Following his death, First Lieutenant Cleary's father, Jack,  described his last conversation with his son the day before he died.  Jack Cleary is someone I have gotten to know since his son's passing,  but here is what Jack said at that time. I am quoting him directly.  ``He''--meaning Michael--``was very upset that they were sending home  some of his men without their awards . . . for things like promotions,  and he was fighting for his men. That is the kind of officer he was.  Michael was a fine man. He cared about all people, great and small.''  Jack Cleary knows of what he speaks because he, himself, served in  Vietnam and, as I mentioned earlier, was also a graduate of the same  college. 1LT Michael Cleary's legacy lives on with his family. His  mother, Marianne, is a member of Gold Star Mothers where she works to  support veterans, military families, and her community every day.  Jon Bellona, Michael's college roommate, is a director and founder of  the 1LT Michael Joseph Cleary: Run for the Fallen, a run across America  to raise awareness about the lives of those who fought to activate  their memories and to keep their spirits alive. Run for the Fallen  supports organizations that help wounded veterans, as well as the  families of those killed, and helps aid the healing process for those  Americans whose lives have been affected by war.  All Americans are grateful for the friends and family of fallen  servicemembers who not only continue the legacy of service to the  Nation, but who take their tragedy and turn it into a force for good.  1LT Michael Cleary is one of so many bright, talented, and dedicated  young men and women who have died in service to our country. While I  speak specifically of Michael today, his story is the story of  thousands of men and women across our country, hundreds of them in  Pennsylvania who have given their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan and  also have given their lives in service of American values, values like  democracy and liberty and rule of law.  As we remember Michael Cleary, we should also remember the words of  Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln reminded us that people like Michael  Cleary gave, as Lincoln said, ``The last full measure of devotion to  our country.'' It is at times like this when we should remember not  only those words, but also other words from the Gettysburg Address,  where he said, ``It is us, the living, rather, to be dedicated here to  the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly  advanced.''  So that was our charge from President Lincoln all those generations  ago. We must strive every day, whether we are citizens or public  officials, whatever our station in life, we must strive every day to  complete that unfinished work that Lincoln talked about, so that, as we  discuss major security issues like U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan or  combating the resurgence of ISIS in the Middle East or exercising  oversight over U.S. military engagements overseas and look increasingly  to try to resolve complicated global crises, we must not forget that  those who have given the ultimate sacrifice and service to our country,  particularly in the most recent wars, are those we should remember.  Just consider these numbers of Americans who have lost their lives in  the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, with an additional seven killed in  African Command operations since 2001. That number is 6,989 Americans  just in those conflicts, just in that timeframe. These 6,989 Americans  includes some 300 servicemembers from Pennsylvania, the fifth highest  total of any State. No. 2, over 49,000 in that time period have been  wounded, including more than roughly 2,000 from Pennsylvania. So 6,989  killed since 2001 nationwide and over 49,000 wounded in that time  period.  Third, although the administration refuses to be transparent in its  deployment tracking, press reports indicate that approximately 19,000  Americans are currently serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, with an  additional 65,000 serving the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia.  This year, Pennsylvania lost MSG Benjamin Hines of York County, PA,  assigned to the 25th Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division, Marine  Forces Reserve. He was killed by a roadside bomb on April 8 in Parwan  Province, Afghanistan, along with two other marines: SSG Christopher  Slutman and SGT Robert Hendricks. Staff Sergeant Slutman also had  family ties to my home State of Pennsylvania.  While we are so grateful that Pennsylvania did not suffer more losses  this year, any loss of life is not only devastating, but should also  cause us to reconsider the nature of our military commitments overseas.  These fighting men and women are born into families, [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7017\">Page S7017</a>, ] not into divisions and brigades. They are sons and daughters, husbands  and wives, fathers and mothers. Their love for their families are  matched only by their devotion to our country, but many more bear the  scars of war.  Some families have a loved one who served in Iraq or Afghanistan and  were returned home, but who were one of the more than 49,000 who were  wounded. We must not overlook the unusually high percentage of Iraq and  Afghanistan veterans who have died since returning home, whether from a  drug overdose or suicide or the effects of combat. Thousands of  American families continue to pay a terrible price for the courage and  dedication of their family members who gave life and limb for this  country.  We have much to think about, not only on this day, but, of course, in  this season--this season of hope, this season of gratitude, this season  of our time together with our families back home, but we should  especially remember those families who have loved and lost, those who  have lost someone in combat, those who have lost someone who served so  nobly, served on behalf of the rest of us.  At this time, Mr. President, I know you have personal experience with  this, having served yourself, and I know that you understand this. It  is an important time to remember those who have given so much for our  country, with the spirit of gratitude for their service, hope that we  don't have more losses in the coming year, and with confidence that  they have set a great example for us.  I yield the floor.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    ", "Mr. BARRASSO": " Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mary Eileen  Manning, a State Department fellow in Senator Sullivan's office, be  granted floor privileges for the remainder of the Congress.    ", "Mr. MURPHY": " Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am on the floor briefly today to remind  my colleagues to remind their constituents that December 15 is the open  enrollment deadline for healthcare at healthcare.gov. This is  incredibly important because if you are uninsured or you are currently  on an Affordable Care Act plan, if you don't renew or sign up by the  15th, you will be frozen out of the marketplace unless you have what is  called a qualifying event.  As we head back for the weekend, I want to ensure we do everything we  can to make sure there are aren't more people who go into the New Year  without insurance than absolutely necessary. This is especially  important because we have seen a big decline in the number of people  who have insurance in this country since President Trump took office.  Obviously, we made enormous progress after the passage of the  Affordable Care Act. We were able to get the percentage of Americans  without insurance down to around 5 percent. That is really  extraordinary. Yet we have seen that progress reverse. We have seen  more and more people go without insurance since this administration  started to wage what is a pretty consistent, remarkable war on the  Affordable Care Act.  As we speak today, the Trump administration is in court trying to get  the court system--the Federal court system--to strike down the entirety  of the Affordable Care Act. If they are successful in that endeavor,  then next year's deadline will not matter because the Affordable Care  Act will be gone; 20 million people will lose their health insurance;  insurers will once again be able to charge you more because you have a  preexisting condition or your kid has cancer or you are a woman.  As we fight that court case, we need to remember that the Affordable  Care Act is still out there and is still very affordable for millions  and millions of Americans. Seventy percent of enrollees who go on to  healthcare.gov find they qualify for financial help, meaning the  sticker price is not actually what you pay. The tax credits in  ObamaCare will help you get that premium lower.  In fact, on average, folks are getting pretty sizable premiums--in  the neighborhood of $500. That could make healthcare incredibly  affordable, even if the sticker price looks out of your range.  A woman in Hartford, named Deborah, visited a local enrollment fair  after receiving a letter saying her premiums actually might be going  up. She said this:  That scared me a little bit so I wanted to come in and have   someone explain it to me whether it was going to go up,   decrease, you know, what were my options. What ended up   happening is that actually my premium went down for the same   plan but I also learned that just because they renew you that   I had the opportunity to go in and say no, I don't want that   plan, I want to choose this plan. I am ecstatic with my new   plan. . . . I got educated on the insurance process and I   like that.  You can still get that help. You can still get somebody on the phone  to walk you through your choices. I really encourage people to do that  by this Sunday.  For folks who do find an affordable plan, I hope you will also step  up and try to help us maintain the protections and the coverages we  have. We have been fighting a battle with the Trump administration. It  doesn't like the Affordable Care Act simply because the President's  name is on it, despite the fact that Americans don't want the  Affordable Care Act repealed. But the administration has been doing  everything within its power to try to make it harder for people to sign  up. The administration has rolled back the advertising for the  Affordable Care Act.  This is what qualifies for advertising today--charts on the floor of  the U.S. Senate. The administration has rolled back the money for the  navigators--the people who help you pick which plan is right for you.  The administration, for a period of time, threatened to stop paying  insurance companies, which chilled the interest of insurers to actually  offer plans on these exchanges. As I mentioned, the administration is  going to court to try to unroll and unwind the entirety of the act  through a court case.  Lastly, though, what you will find, if you go and enroll in some  States, are plans that look like an Affordable Care Act plan on these  websites but actually aren't. They are what we call junk plans, short- term plans--plans that don't really cover anything. They might not  cover maternity care or addiction care or mental health or prescription  drugs. Some of these junk plans don't cover you if you get admitted  into the hospital on a Friday or Saturday.  Be careful of those plans because the sticker price is going to look  really low, but that is for a reason. It is because they don't cover  anything.  The President has allowed for those junk plans to be shown right next  to [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7015\">Page S7015</a>, ] the Affordable Care Act plan. Make sure you are signing up for a  regulated, Affordable Care Act plan. That is a plan that is bronze or  silver or gold, not one of these junk short-term plans that is not  going to be right for the vast majority of Americans.  It is not too late. Sunday is the deadline. If you are in  Connecticut, make sure to go to Access Health CT or your State  exchange, if your State runs an exchange.

", "Ms. HIRONO": " Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago today, the State of Hawaii was  in shock as an active shooter took the lives of two workers at Pearl  Harbor Naval Shipyard and wounded a third worker.  Located on Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam, the shipyard is a pillar  of our community. It employs over 6,400 workers who labor every day to  keep our Pacific Fleet ``Fit to Fight.''  Hawaii is a small place where we have deep connections to one  another. Almost everyone in Hawaii either is related to or knows  someone who works on base or in the shipyard. In my State office in  Honolulu, a member of my staff has a son who is an apprentice at the  shipyard and who was there that day. These connections are part of the  reason why the shooting has impacted our State so deeply. Too many  families were waiting that day for news of their loved ones in harm's  way.  The investigation into what happened is ongoing, and there is no easy  explanation for what happened and why.  It is clear that no community in our country is immune from the  tragedy of gun violence. Today, I rise to honor the lives of those we  lost--Roldan A. Agustin and Vincent J. Kapoi, Jr.  Mr. Kapoi and Mr. Agustin were both dedicated Department of Defense-- DOD--civilian shipyard workers and members of the International  Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers Local 121.  Roldan Agustin was 49 years old and lived in Ewa Beach. He was adored  by his family, who describe him as a ``true American patriot'' who  dedicated his career to his country. After serving honorably in the  U.S. Navy, Mr. Agustin also served in the Army National Guard, retiring  as a staff sergeant, having deployed to Afghanistan and Kuwait.  At Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, he served as a DOD civilian employee,  working as a shop planner in nondestructive testing and a metals  inspector.  In paying tribute to their lost loved one, Mr. Agustin's family said  in a statement:  He was a loving son, brother, uncle, and friend to many.   Having grown up in Waipahu, Roldan enjoyed working on cars   with his friends and spending time with his family and adored   his nieces. We will forever remember Roldan to be humble and   honest, and a generous and patient man.  Vincent Kapoi was 30 years old and lived in Honolulu. He grew up in  Waianae and graduated from Kamehameha schools. His father, brother,  sister, and sister-in-law are also civilian employees at the shipyard,  where he served as a metals inspector apprentice. He was dearly loved  by his family, which includes his wife, parents, siblings, aunties,  uncles, grandmother, cousins, and friends.  His wife offered these loving words:  I have been through a lot of tragedy in my life, but   nothing compares to losing the love of your life. I will miss   you truly, and I will always love you Vincent J. Kapoi Jr.  His sister Theona said in a family statement:  He will always be that easy going, fun loving, ``let's do   this'' man that will remain in our hearts. There are so many   unanswered questions. We all have to be honest, it changes   nothing because we can't bring him back. What we must do is   honor his memory, keep him alive in our hearts.  I also want to honor Roger Nakamine, who was wounded in the attack.  Mr. Nakamine was working as a civilian apprentice at the shipyard when  he was wounded.  Upon leaving the hospital about a week after the attack, Mr. Nakamine  said:  My family and I would like to express our gratitude to the   first responders and the expert medical staff at Queen's, as   well as to all the friends and extended `ohana who have been   reaching out to offer their support physically, emotionally   and spiritually. Our deepest condolences go out to the   friends and family of Vincent Kapoi Jr. and Roldan Agustin.  Roldan and Vincent, like thousands of their fellow workers, dedicated  themselves to the shipyard's critically important mission of repairing,  maintaining, and modernizing the U.S. Pacific Fleet in defense of our  country.  In recognition of their service and in keeping with the words of  their families, I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring the  lives of those we lost: Roldan Agustin and Vincent Kapoi, Jr.  This is a photograph that depicts the memorial, which was set up the  day after this tragedy, where friends and family brought lei to honor  their fallen heroes, their loved ones.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mrs. MURRAY": " Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    ", "Mr. TESTER": " Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, we have had a fruitful day here today. We  passed a lot of bills. We did it in a bipartisan way. I want to thank  both Leader McConnell and Leader Schumer for their good work, as well  as Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Leahy for their good work on  these bills.  Today, I am going to do something that I have never done before. I am  going to read an obituary about a man I don't believe I have ever met,  even though I was in the Veterans' Home of Columbia Falls while he was  there. This obituary was passed on to me by my wife, who got it from a  friend. It is incredibly powerful because, quite frankly, it is about  one man, but it is actually about a generation of men and women who  served in Vietnam.  This guy's name was William Ebeltoft. The obituary goes like this:  ``Not everyone who lost his life in Vietnam died there.''   The saying is true for CW2 William C. Ebeltoft. He died on   December 15, 2019 at the Veteran's Home in Columbia Falls,   Montana. He died 50 years after he lost, in Vietnam, all that   underpinned his life. He was 73 years old.  Everyone called him ``Bill.'' He was loved by the nursing   staff who cared for him. He was loved by the fellow veterans   with whom he lived; those he helped when he was able and   entertained with funny German slang and a stint at the piano   when he could. He was a virtuoso when playing ``Waltzing   Matilda.''  His small family loved him dearly. He was preceded in death   by his parents, Paul and Mary Ebeltoft of Dickinson, North   Dakota, whose devotion and care for their war-damaged boy was   strong and unfailing. He is survived by his brother, Paul   Ebeltoft, and the one he loved as the sister he never had,   Paul's wife, Gail. . . . It is difficult to write about Bill.   He lived three lives: before, during and after Vietnam.   Before Vietnam, Bill was a handsome man, who wore clothing   well; a man with white, straight teeth that showed in his   ready smile. A state champion trap shooter, a low handicap   golfer, a 218-average bowler, a man of quick, earthy wit,   with a fondness for children, old men, hunting, fast cars,   and a cold Schlitz. He told jokes well.  During Vietnam, he lived with horrors of which he would   only seldom speak. Slow Motion Four, Bill's personal call   sign, logged thousands of helicopter flight hours performing   Forward Support Base resupply landings, medical evacuations,   exfils and gun ship runs. We know of him there mostly through   medals for valor he received, and these were many. . . .   While attempting to resupply B Company, [Warrant Officer]   Ebeltoft's co-pilot became wounded. Realizing the importance   of the mission WO Ebeltoft elected to attempt completion of   the mission. Due to his superior knowledge of the aircraft,   the helicopter was kept under control during the period in   which the pilot was wounded and the ship was under fire.   Remaining under attack from automatic weapons fire, the   supply mission was successfully completed. While unloading   the supplies, WO Ebeltoft received word that there were five   emergency medical evacuation cases located 200 meters to his   rear. WO Ebeltoft re-positioned his helicopter and picked up   the wounded personnel. While evacuating the wounded, the   commanding officer of Company B was injured. WO Ebeltoft   again maneuvered his aircraft to enable evacuation of the   injured officer. WO Ebeltoft then proceeded to evacuate all   injured personnel by the fastest possible means. Upon   completion, examination of the aircraft revealed that the   aircraft had sustained nine enemy .30 caliber hits.  Bill got the medal, of course, but he would have been the   last to say anything about it. The citation shows the type of   man that he, and many of his brothers-in-arms in Vietnam   were; and still are today, albeit battered hard and unfairly   by the cruel winds of the time in which they fought.  After being discharged as a decorated hero, Bill had a   rough re-entry into civilian life. It is not necessary to   recount Bill's portion of what is an all-too-common story for   wartime veterans, particularly those of the Vietnam era. It   may be sufficient to say that after a run at business, a   marriage and while grappling daily with his demons, his   mental faculties escaped him. Bill became a resident of the   Veteran's Home in Columbia Falls, Montana in 1994. He lived   there for the next 26 years.  At the Home, the patina of his memory covered life's   sorrows, and it was a blessing. Bill was happy there, living   a life that was a strange mixture of hunting stories, pickup   trucks and memories of some of his better times with women,   friends and the outdoor life. Bill denied that anyone he   loved had died; could not understand why anyone would fill   with gas at four bucks a gallon when ``Johnny's Standard   sells it for 27 cents;'' and still ``drove'' his 1968 Dodge   Charger. He was unfailingly courteous. His largest concerns   were making his smoke breaks and finding his wallet (a search   of 26 years.)  In the past year, Bill's shaky grip on physical health also   slipped through his fingers. Yet, despite this, what we loved   in him remained, if only sometimes as a shadow. Even after   his serious decline, suffering fractures because of falls,   Bill would tell the staff that he was ``just fine'' and not   to worry about him. Thin, hunched over, propelling himself   with one foot, he would wheel himself into the room of a bed-  ridden veteran and sit there, next to the bed, unspeaking.   The nursing staff was certain that Bill thought that the man   in bed was lonely and needed company.  Bill was always a proud man, remembering himself as he was   in 1969, not as he became. Who are we to suggest differently?   His was not a life that many would wish for, but in some   ways, Bill was a lucky man. He was surrounded to the end by   staff who enjoyed and respected him. He had a chance to be   helpful to others who were doing less well than he. And the   passing of the seasons never diminished his plans for another   elk hunt or to ``see that beautiful girl again this   weekend.''  When a small slice of reality penetrated his pleasant   confusion, Bill struggled to understand why he was where he   was. Prematurely aged, his worldly goods in a small dresser,   not knowing who the President might be or remembering why he   should care, Bill's losses were greater than most of us could   endure. Yet, to those who love him, his brother and his   brother's wife, and their sons, he will always be a brave,   accomplished man, more generous than was wise, more trusting   than was safe.  It is not possible to wrap your arms around a loved one who   leaves. But it is possible to wrap your heart around a   memory. Bill's will be well taken care of.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mrs. FISCHER": " Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues to honor  my friend, the senior Senator from Georgia. At the end of this year,  Senator Isakson will retire after 20 years of service to the people of  Georgia in Washington.  After protecting our Nation in the Georgia Air National Guard,  graduating from the University of Georgia, and serving as a  representative in his State legislature, the door opened for a son from  Atlanta to run for Congress. Georgia saw in him then what we see in him  now: a principled leader, a skillful communicator, and a man worth  trusting. It is no surprise that the people of Georgia have renewed  their trust in him time and time again. And I know I speak for my  colleagues when I say that we are grateful they did.  After six years representing Georgia's Sixth Congressional District,  the Senate gained a true statesman when he entered in 2005. When I was  preparing for these remarks, I came across one of his Senate reelection  speeches. I thought it was particularly revealing to his character and  how he carries himself in the Senate. He told the crowd that was  cheering him on:  I promise you I am ready . . . I am ready to tackle   whatever problem life brings to us as Americans.  With my feet rooted in conservative principles, my belief   in God the Father Almighty, and my belief in the people of   Georgia.  Mr. President, that is who Senator Isakson is.  No matter the obstacles that came his way, he has always been a  steady hand--strengthened by his enduring faith and deep respect for  his constituents. One of those mountains to climb was working on behalf  of our veterans to improve conditions at the VA and end the backlog  that was building for years. Under his leadership on the Veterans'  Affairs Committee, I was proud to work with him to pass the CHIP-In for  Vets Act into law in 2016. The bill allows local communities to take  the lead on new projects by permitting the VA to accept private  contributions to ensure VA projects are finished both on time and on  budget. His support of this bill meant that Nebraskans have the  opportunity to save millions of dollars when constructing the new Omaha  VA Ambulatory Clinic. A GAO report indicates that our new facility is  now $34 million under budget and 4\\\\1/2\\\\ months ahead of schedule. I  know generations of Nebraskans will be grateful for his help in getting  this bill across the finish line.  On a more personal note, one of my fondest memories of Johnny was our  trip to Normandy, France, this year to commemorate the 75th anniversary  of D-Day. As a veteran himself, everyone in this body understood the  abounding respect and gratitude he carried for our Nation's  servicemembers as he led the delegation--the same respect and gratitude  he shows to our veterans everyday as he leads the Senate in providing  resources to meet our veterans' needs.  Mr. President, I think if there is any moment that foreshadowed  Johnny's service to Georgia and our Nation, it was his speech  immediately after being sworn in to the House of Representatives. He  turned to his new colleagues and said, ``I hope, in years to come, I'll  be a respected friend, and one who joined with you to make a difference  in the United States of America.'' What a respected friend he has  become. What a difference he has made. It has been a honorable journey,  and it ends with us confirming that the legacy he has worked hard to  achieve from the very beginning has now come true in the end.  Johnny, you are a great leader, a careful listener, and a gifted  legislator. It has been a privilege to work with you and call you  friend. You have served the State of Georgia and our country well. I  wish you and Diane all the best on this next chapter in your lives.  Godspeed.    ", "Mr. BROWN": " Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Robert Greenstein, founder and president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, for his work over nearly four decades, fighting for a more just and equal society. Bob founded CBPP in 1981 to push for policies that expand opportunity for the lowest income children and families, and ensure that this country's prosperity is shared with the workers who create it, not just the wealthiest CEOs and the largest corporations. He built CBPP from the ground up and transformed it from a tiny organization with a shoestring budget to one of the most influential policy shapers in the country. Under Bob's leadership, CBPP combined in-depth analysis and research with clear-headed strategy to drive the debate and deliver results. We worked together to spearhead efforts to permanently expand the earned income tax credit and child tax credit in 2015, and Bob was vital to our success. It is probably the most important thing we have done to life people out of poverty in the last 25 years, and it could not have happened without Bob's leadership on this issue, stretching back decades. Of course it is not only tax credits; from passing the Affordable Care Act to strengthening SNAP, from protecting and expanding Medicaid, to fighting for more affordable housing, Bob's work at CBPP has meant that millions of ordinary Americans have more food on the table, more money in their pockets, and a little more economic security. Over his career he has touched so many lives, and he has so much to be proud of. We know we have a lot more work to do, and while Bob has earned his retirement, I have faith that he will continue to be a force for the progressive change that our country needs.<bullet>   ", "Mr. SCHATZ": " Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.  Let's get clear about what is happening here. The first thing is we  did something momentous as a group. We, on a bipartisan basis, decided  to provide paid parental leave of 12 weeks for the Federal workforce-- 2.1 million Federal workers--so that individuals who are new parents  don't have to make that impossible choice between receiving a paycheck  and being a new dad or a new mom. Now, this is catching us up with the  rest of the world. The rest of the industrialized world understands  that this isn't just a humane thing to do for families. This is the  right way to manage the workforce because you get higher productivity;  you get better morale; and you get lower turnover. This is a smart  thing to do.  There were 2.1 million people covered by this momentous change of  Federal policy agreed upon over the last 48 hours on a bipartisan  basis. There was a technical problem, and so the following Federal  employees are not going to be covered unless we make this technical  fix: employees of the DC courts, public defenders, Presidential  appointees, FAA, and CSA employees, and article I judges. Everybody  else is going to get 12 weeks of paid parental leave, except for these  people. We can solve that today.  That is what my unanimous consent request is all about. What the  Senator from Pennsylvania has decided to do is take a hostage and say,  These are the only Federal employees who are not going to get this  benefit because of a technical and drafting error because I didn't get  something totally unrelated that has to do with a tax bill that was  passed on purely partisan lines in a hurry, written primarily by  lobbyists in the middle of the night.  Now, I do not mind entertaining a change to the Tax Code to deal with  this question of how you expense the renovation of restaurants and  retail operations, but I think Senator Wyden is exactly right. I guess  the Senator from Pennsylvania thought this was a talking point on the  Republican side. Heaven forbid if there should be a negotiation. Heaven  forbid something that is as important to the Republicans that is as a  result of their screw-up and would cost tens of billions of dollars  would not be given away for free.  The argument being made is, hey, technical for technical. This is an  actual technical fix. This is a bill we just enacted in the last 48  hours. I am not even sure if the President has signed it yet, but it is  about to be enacted into law, and nobody is arguing that we should not  cover some small portion of the Federal workforce.  Nobody is arguing that was the legislative intent. Nobody is arguing  that is public policy. What the Senator from Pennsylvania is saying, If  I don't get my thing, then these people don't get the help that they  deserve. These people, by happenstance of a drafting error, don't get  paid parental leave. Now, this has human consequences.  I object to the Senator's modification of my unanimous consent  request, and I am deeply disappointed that we can't fix this simple  thing. I am happy to work with the Senator from Pennsylvania on a quick  fix. I think we will get there at some point next year, but this has to  be part of a broader bipartisan deal, and he knows that.  This is going to cost tens of billions of dollars, and no one gives  tens of billions of dollars for nothing. Everything of that magnitude  has to be negotiated on a bipartisan, bicameral basis. That is not what  he is trying to do. He is trying to say because we made a technical  error that was monumentally wrong and, as a result of the flawed  process, why don't we trade technical fixes. This is a relatively small  technical fix, and he wants to trade it for a massive technical fix  that is now 2 years old.  The only thing I would say is this may be small in the context of how  we operate in the U.S. Senate. It is not small if you work for the FAA  and you are a new dad. It is not small if you are an article I judge  and you are a new mom. It is not small for these people who deserve  paid parental leave like every other Federal employee will get soon.    ", "Mr. BOOZMAN": " Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of  Fayetteville, AR, Police Officer Stephen Carr, who made the ultimate  sacrifice in the line of duty on Saturday, December 7.  Officer Carr was sitting in his patrol car in the parking lot behind  the police station when he was shot and killed. The 27-year-old had  been a member of the Fayetteville Police Department for 2\\\\1/2\\\\ years  and was assigned as a patrol officer in the Dickson Street  entertainment area.  In that short time with the police department, he demonstrated his  professionalism and duty to upholding the rule of law. The Fayetteville  police chief described Carr as an exemplary officer who was an all- American boy. The chief said at a press conference over the weekend:  ``If I had 131 Stephen Carr's, I wouldn't be more ecstatic.''  Carr grew up in a law enforcement family. He witnessed the  dedication, service, and commitment to protecting the community by  people he loved. His friends described him as a strong and kind person,  whose lifelong dream was to serve as a police officer.  He loved spending time outdoors hunting and fishing. A graduate from  The Woodlands High School in The Woodlands, TX, Carr played football  and earned recognition as an all-district offensive lineman. He went on  to play football at Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, MO, and  his former coach described him as a young man who made a big impact on  campus.  We rely on law enforcement officers to keep us safe. Each day they  put on their uniform, knowing the risks that come with public duty to  serve and to protect. Officer Carr's death is a reminder of the dangers  these first responders face daily and how quickly a situation can go  from ordinary to deadly, which is why those willing to take on this  role deserve both our gratitude and our respect.  The outpouring of support from the Fayetteville community has been a  tremendous strength to the police department as they mourn the loss of  a brother in blue. I pray they we will find comfort from this  encouragement during this very, very difficult time.  My thoughts and prayers go out to Officer Carr's family and friends.  I also stand with all Arkansans in expressing our gratitude for Officer  Carr's service and commitment to honoring the sacrifice that he and  others have made to protect us. We will forever remember him as a true  American hero.  With that, I yield the floor.    ", "Ms. MURKOWSKI": " Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a long-time  Senate staffer who recently retired, Nathan Bergerbest.  Many Members and staff who have worked on judiciary, military and  veterans, homeland security, public safety, foreign relations,  intelligence, or Native American issues and national and international  disasters likely had the opportunity to work with Nathan during the 16  years he served the people of Alaska and the Nation. I am sure that  many can share stories of the help Nathan offered, ideas he pushed to  fruition, and wise counsel he provided. My statement today will offer  just a slice of the many contributions this accomplished man has made  in the lives of so many.  Nathan began his interest in good public policy and politics at a  young age growing up in New York City. I believe he once said that he  got involved in his first political campaign in elementary school  because he was searching for the candidate who could improve his  neighborhood. His quest for what was right, what was fair, and what was  useful public policy has never subsided.  An attorney, Nathan has been a litigator, represented an Alaska  Native regional corporation, and worked at FEMA. He started in my  office in 2003 as legislative assistant and retired as senior counsel  and deputy chief of staff. Throughout his service here in the Senate,  Nathan was the quintessential Senate staffer--working late, knowing his  subject cold, understanding the ways of the Senate and navigating them  brilliantly.  His portfolio was huge, complex, and important. Yet he never shirked  from pitching in where he could be useful. Nathan served not only as a  mentor to young staffers in my office but as the conscience of Federal  agency employees, military personnel, and elected leaders--constantly  challenging us to do better, to be better versions of ourselves.  While a tribute from a former employer is always gratifying, Nathan  made a lasting impression on so many who have worked here in the Senate  over the years. I would like to share some of their stories. Several of  the military fellows who have served in my office and worked closely  with Nathan shared these words:  Nathan was part of the original group that came to be known   as the Fairbanks Tiger Team, leading the red-shirted charge   with the Fairbanks community against the Air Force's proposed   plan to remove the F-16 Aggressor Squadron from Eielson Air   Force Base. He rallied community leaders, helped leverage the   effort on the Defense Appropriations Committee, and   ultimately helped the Alaska delegation save Eielson. Then,   only a year later, he worked to support the Alaska   delegation's strong push to bring the F-35 to Eielson. In   just over a year, the delegation was able to take Eielson   from a near-shuttered installation, to one that will soon   have the most capable fighter aircraft in the world, with   significant infrastructure investment to support it.  The Tiger Team still meets over telephone or in person   every other Friday to discuss housing and other local   community issues related to the military. The team has   evolved over the years with new members joining and old   members retiring or moving to different lines of work. Nathan   will be missed on these calls but his legacy will be forever   forged in the Fairbanks community and the national defense of   our country.  New commanders coming to Washington, DC, for their Hill visits would  often ask my military and veterans affairs liaison in Anchorage for  advice about how to prepare. The advice they received was ``Don't try  to BS Nathan, because he'll be able to sniff it out.'' Several of these  commanders were relieved when the meeting with Nathan was over.  But Nathan would bend over backwards to help the military or a  servicemember. ``A Colonel who served in Alaska attributed Nathan for  saving his career. He didn't give any details. Only that he owed him  everything.'' That is just like Nathan--to do good for an American and  move on to the next task.  Nathan was a true friend to the Alaska National Guard as   well, very close to the Adjutant Generals, and always quick   to help support their needs or tout their accomplishments.  Nathan was extremely proud that Alaska boasts the highest   rate of veterans per capita and worked to ensure strong   representation of the Total Force military and veteran   communities, always working to advance veterans' rights and   benefits. His efforts helped lead to improvements in VA   hospitals in Alaska as well as advances in telemedicine and   other support to veterans in remote Alaskan communities.  Public safety and support for law enforcement were always priorities  for Nathan. He helped to lead collaborative efforts among the Federal  agencies and State and local law enforcement to keep drugs out of  Alaskan communities, and he never missed honoring the fallen at the  National Fallen Officers Memorial ceremonies. He cared deeply for all  those who put themselves in harm's way.  While he was a policy expert in so many areas, Nathan was never one  to ignore a plea for help from an individual Alaskan. There are  countless examples of ``casework'' that he took on in addition to his  legislative duties. From arranging military honors for veterans'  funerals, persuading the Canadian Border Security Agency to reinstate  24-hour border crossings between Hyder, AK, and British Columbia,  ensuring Alaskans' concerns were heard by the Navy prior to Northern  Edge exercises, protecting National Guard members from retaliation  during an investigation of sexual misconduct complaints, improving the  standard of care at VA medical facilities, or any number of efforts,  Nathan started with the question ``What does the individual need?'' and  went about getting it done. In many instances, Nathan would help my  staff in Alaska navigate the bureaucracy to help solve an Alaskan's  problem.  A former attorney for FEMA, Nathan was also the Alaska delegation's  go-to staffer whenever disaster struck. After the November 2018  earthquake struck Anchorage, Mat-Su, and the Kenai Peninsula, Nathan  helped disentangle municipalities, school districts, business owners,  and individuals from the byzantine red tape that often characterizes  FEMA. In call after call, Nathan translated FEMA's language and  policies for Alaskans and worked with FEMA officials to do a better job  assessing and responding to the damage. When FEMA sought to respond to  a flood in Galena but lacked a sense of the challenges of rural Alaska,  Nathan helped prod and guide the agency in improving the response.  Nathan took the same sense of dedication to his work on Indian,  Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian issues. Leading Alaska tribal rights  attorney Lloyd Miller called Nathan ``one of the most knowledgeable and  talented lawyers to ever work on the Hill. He combined an unmatched  mastery of Alaska Native legal history with a deep sensitivity to  Alaska Native issues gained from working inside one of the major Alaska  Native regional corporations. And while his background before coming to  the Hill was predominantly with Alaska Native corporations, he was  equally knowledgeable about the unique challenges confronting Alaska  Native Tribes, and the importance of supporting the critical role that  Alaska Tribes play alongside their corporations. Nathan's remarkable  intellect and sage advice will be deeply missed.''  Over the years, as protestors filled the halls of Capitol Hill and  individual offices, Nathan would stay late to talk with those who  visited my office. He would sit with them for long periods and talk  about how they can best navigate the issues, and how they, as  advocates, could best approach offices for meetings and how they can  present their issues in such a way that they were truly being heard on  both sides of the aisle. On at least one or two occasions, I have seen  him go and literally sit on the floor with protestors outside of my  office for an hour or two--just listening to what they had to say so  that he could ensure I understood the concerns of Americans who are so  passionate about the important issues of the day.  No matter what the time of day or day of the week, Nathan made  himself available to me, to other members of my staff, and to Alaskans.  As my constituent services director in Anchorage put it, ``I remember  one time in particular in 2011 where he and I each took 12-hour shifts  around the clock so we could help Alaskan constituents after the 9.0  magnitude earthquake struck in the Pacific Ocean off the northeast  coast of Japan. A massive tsunami was triggered that flooded Japan's  coastal [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7203\">Page S7203</a>, ] communities and damaged infrastructure. We spent several days in  communication with constituents stranded in Japan that were trying to  navigate the treacherous environment, communicate with the State  Department, and ultimately obtain transportation home. He was also  helpful in working with stranded Alaskan constituents after the 2015  severe earthquake in Nepal. He reached out to the lobbyist for Orbitz,  since many of the foreign air carriers on their website raised prices  drastically when trying to book flights out of Nepal after the  earthquake.''  There are so many stories illustrative of Nathan's positive influence  here in the U.S. Senate and in Alaska.  I thank Nathan Bergerbest for his service to Alaska and the Nation  and wish him well.    ", "Ms. FEINSTEIN": " Ms. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the  ``California Desert Protection and Recreation Act of 2019.''  This bill represents a decade-long collaborative effort between  conservationists, the off-road vehicle recreational community, State  and local governments, small businesses, and public utilities. Through  this collaborative effort, we have developed a path forward to  sustainably and comprehensively manage California's fragile desert  resources.  Before I continue, I would especially like to thank Senators Lisa  Murkowski and Maria Cantwell, as well as their staff, for all of their  hard work to move this bill forward last Congress. With their  assistance, this legislation passed out of the Senate Energy and  Natural Resources Committee in October 2018 and was included in a  bipartisan public lands package.  Despite the disappointing outcome of last Congress, we have come  farther with this bill than ever before, and I look forward to working  once again with Senator Murkowski, as well as the newly designated  Ranking Member Joe Manchin, to maintain our momentum and pass this bill  as quickly as possible.  I also would like to express my gratitude to Representative Paul Cook  and his staff for their tremendous work and collaboration on this  legislation over the past two years.  The California desert is as special as it is unique. Unlike many  deserts in the world, our desert is abundant with plant and animal  species, many of [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S105\">Page S105</a>, ] which are only found in California. From the iconic Joshua Trees to the  desert tortoise, big horn sheep, and scores of wildflowers, the beauty  of the California desert is unrivaled.  I have heard from thousands of constituents who share a love for the  peace and tranquility of this majestic area, such as young students  from urban areas exposed to the desert for the first time and veterans  returning home from warzones finding much-needed quiet in California's  desert landscapes.  When I first came to Washington twenty-six years ago, Senator Alan  Cranston asked me to assume the mantle and carry on his efforts to  protect the desert by introducing and passing a desert protection bill.  Despite opposition, and even filibuster attempts, the California  Desert Protection Act of 1994 passed and was signed into law by  President Clinton. Since then, we have all watched the unique desert  plants, animals, and surrounding communities flourish, attracting  visitors from around the world.  The 1994 bill permanently protected more than 7.5 million acres of  pristine desert land in national parks and preserves, and I worked  closely with President Obama in 2016 to designate three new desert  National monuments that protected a further 1.8 million acres.  The original Desert Protection Act was a crowning achievement for  desert conservation, establishing 69 new Wilderness areas, creating the  Mojave National Preserve, and converting Death Valley and Joshua Tree  National Monuments into National Parks. All told, we were able to  protect, or increase protections for about 9.6 million acres.  I am proud to have been a part of these achievements for the desert,  and I remain steadfast in my commitment to get this legislation across  the finish line.  As I mentioned earlier, this bill represents the varied interests of  desert stakeholders and balances the many uses of the California  desert. I'll highlight some of what's in the bill now.  The bill designates approximately 375,500 acres of wilderness,  including eight new Bureau of Land Management (BLM) wilderness areas.  It expands Death Valley National Park Wilderness by approximately  88,000 acres and adds 7,141 acres to the San Gorgonio Wilderness within  San Bernardino National Forest.  This bill also expands Joshua Tree National Park by 4,518 acres and  Death Valley National Park by approximately 35,292 acres. The additions  to Joshua Tree National Park include 1,600 acres donated by the Mojave  Desert Land Trust.  The legislation also officially designates six existing Off-Highway  Vehicle Recreation Areas totaling 200,580 acres to provide certainty  that these recreational uses will be protected and maintained in a  manner similar to conservation areas.  Two more additions are the Alabama Hills National Scenic Area in Inyo  County and the Vinagre Wash Special Management Area in Imperial County.  The Alabama Hills National Scenic Area preserves 18,610 acres for  continued recreation and conservation. The Vinagre Wash Special  Management Area covers approximately 81,800 acres of Bureau of Land  Management land to provide for wilderness preservation, vehicular use  on designated routes, and limitations on extractive uses of the land  within the management area.  Lastly, this bill designates 77 miles of Wild and Scenic Rivers.  Desert conservation has never been a partisan issue. Over the years,  legislators have come together across party lines to preserve and  protect California's desert.  Considering our progress and bipartisan efforts last Congress, I am  hopeful this Congress will take this legislation up and move it forward  as quickly as possible.  This bill represents years of collaborative work and the interests of  a wide variety of groups and communities with the shared goal of  protecting and sustainably managing California's desert. This area is a  true national treasure, and I look forward to continuing our work to  protect it for generations to come.  Thank you.    ", "Ms. SMITH": " Ms. SMITH. Madam President, today I wish to recognize and celebrate  the lives of James Rogers, Charles Nord, and Kort Plantenberg, all  members of the Minnesota National Guard, who tragically lost their  lives in a helicopter accident on Thursday, December 5. After returning  home safely from deployment to the Middle East in May, this loss is  especially heart wrenching. These men conducted medical evacuations in  the Middle East, and their service to our troops and allies will not be  forgotten. I am grateful for their service and sacrifice for Minnesota  and our country.  CW2 James Rogers, often remembered for his curious nature, served 10  years in the Minnesota National Guard, having enlisted before his high  school graduation. CW2 Charles Nord enlisted in 2007, and he leaves  behind his wife, young daughter, and a child on the way. SGT James  Plantenberg enlisted in 2016, was a member of the Guard's biathlon  team, and was preparing to start flight school. We are all indebted to  these men for their service, and I wish their families peace during  this time of tragic loss.    ", "Mr. LANKFORD": " Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, very shortly, the Senate will vote on  the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to  accompany \", H.R. 1865, ', Further Consolidated Appropriations Act. As part  of this appropriations package. a [[', <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7182\">Page S7182</a>, ] version of my bill, the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of  Terrorism Act of 2019, is included in section 903. This bipartisan bill  seeks to restore U.S. court jurisdiction over the Palestinian  Authority, PA/Palestine Liberation Organization, PLO, while promoting  U.S. foreign policy interests in the Middle East through the resumption  of U.S. security assistance to PA security forces. It is a testament to  the hard work of my Democratic and Republican colleagues in this  Chamber that we are about to take up this important legislation.  In 1992, Congress passed the Anti-Terrorism Act, ATA. This law, as  well as future amending legislation, sought to deter and defeat  international terrorism by giving American citizens who are victims of  terrorism overseas the power to sue perpetrators in U.S. court. I was  privileged to work with the original ATA's author, Senator Grassley, in  drafting the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism  Act of 2019.  What our bill--also sponsored by Senators Duckworth, Coons,  Blumenthal, and Rubio--does is strike a balance between Congress's  desire to provide a path forward for American victims of terror to have  their day in court and the toleration by the Members of this body to  allow the PA/PLO to conduct a very narrow scope of activities on U.S.  soil--such as activities pertaining to official business at the United  Nations, engagements with U.S. officials necessary to our national  interest, and legal expenses related to adjudicating or resolving  claims filed in U.S. courts--without consenting to personal  jurisdiction in civil ATA cases. This delicate balance is supported by  a bipartisan coalition of Members of Congress, the executive branch,  and American victims of international terrorism and their families.  For 25 years, the Federal courts struck this balance by holding that  the PLO's and PA's presence and activities in the United States subject  them to jurisdiction in our courts unless they can demonstrate that  their offices in the United States deal exclusively with the official  business of the United Nations and that their activities in this  country are commensurate with their special diplomatic need for being  present here.  The courts correctly held that the PLO's and PA's fundraising and  public relations activities such as press releases and public  appearances, whether characterized as diplomatic public speaking or  proselytizing, are not essential to their diplomatic functions at the  United Nations Headquarters. The bill codifies the distinction  recognized in these cases while giving the PLO and PA a clear choice.  Unless they limit their presence to official business with the United  Nations and their U.S. activities commensurate with their special  diplomatic need to be in the United States, they will be consenting to  personal jurisdiction in ATA cases.  In this regard, the exception in the language for ``ancillary''  activities is intended to permit only essential support or services  that are absolutely necessary to facilitate the conduct of diplomatic  activities expressly exempted in the bill.  By applying the bill to any case pending on or after August 30, 2016,  we are making clear Congress's intent that courts have the power to  restore jurisdiction in cases previously dismissed for lack of  jurisdiction after years of litigation. It is to be liberally construed  to carry out the purposes of Congress to provide relief for victims of  terrorism, and it specifies Congress's intent to enable victims to  pursue justice without being subjected to repetitive, unnecessary, or  protracted litigation, which would just reopen the pain that many  Americans have already suffered through.  As the Congress finishes its final week of the first session of the  116th Congress, I look forward to voting in favor of this important  legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same.    ", "Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina": " Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. President, today I would like to take a moment to recognize Ms. Nancy Whitworth of Greenville, SC, for her over 40 years of service to Greenville County. I extend my congratulations to her on her upcoming retirement and wish to reflect on her successful career. As the longtime economic developer and deputy city manager for the city of Greenville, Nancy was responsible for commercial and neighborhood revitalization, downtown development, business recruitment and retention, planning and zoning, and building codes. She has also authored articles on Greenville's award-winning downtown and meets frequently with other cities to share Greenville's success story. Last year, she was awarded with the 2018 Local Economic Developer of the Year award. Ms. Whitworth is to be commended for her role in spurring the dramatic growth and revitalization Greenville [[<a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7026\">Page S7026</a>]] has seen in the past decades. Through her leadership and dedication to her community, she has been an invaluable asset to the Upstate of South Carolina. Ms. Whitworth is a shining example of a dedicated public servant and should inspire us all to give our best to our communities. I would like to personally commend and thank Ms. Whitworth for her decades of service that encouraged Greenville's economic prosperity and success.<bullet>   ", "Mr. WHITEHOUSE": " Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, we are rapidly running out of time  to protect our future and that of our children and grandchildren from  worsening climate upheaval. America ought to be taking every measure  available to rein in greenhouse gas emissions from legislative action  to legal action, to diplomatic action, to regulatory action, which is  going to be a theme of this talk tonight. We are not doing those  things, and, frankly, it is because of corruption, plain and simple.  Regulatory action, that means enforcing the laws on the books. We  have a Clean Air Act that requires the Environmental Protection Agency  to stop dangerous pollutants from fouling our air. The EPA has found  that greenhouse gases are pollutants under the Clean Air Act, and the  Supreme Court has upheld that finding. That means we ought to be  regulating methane. Methane is among the most potent of greenhouse  gases. When released into the atmosphere, it traps about 30 times more  heat than its chemical cousin, carbon dioxide. Oil and gas extraction  releases massive methane pollution. In fact, a growing body of research  suggests methane pollution from natural gas extraction may completely  offset the climate gains of switching from coal to natural gas.  To fulfill its duties under the Clean Air Act, as a matter of law,  EPA needs to prevent methane pollution. It is the law; it is not  optional. But the corrupt Trump EPA won't fight methane pollution. This  corrupt EPA is run by the fossil fuel industry, which could not care  less about methane emissions.  Within weeks of Scott Pruitt taking control of the Agency, the  corrupted EPA withdrew its request that oil and gas companies even  report methane emissions. The industry knew a true report on methane  leakage would damage their case for natural gas as a less dangerous air  pollutant, so they went to a line of attack, taken directly from the  Big Tobacco playbook: Silence the science. The fewer facts the EPA has,  the less action it needs to take under law--the corrupt Trump EPA  deliberately made itself ignorant and stopped the reporting so it could  avoid its duty.  Step 2 came in March 2017 with the corrupt Trump effort to roll back  existing greenhouse gas regulations, including methane regulations.  Trump's Executive order reads like a fossil fuel lobbyist's dream,  probably because fossil fuel lobbyists wrote it. He called on the EPA  to ``review existing regulations that potentially burden the  development or use of domestically produced energy resources and  appropriately suspend, revise, or rescind those that unduly burden the  development of domestic energy resources.''  Regulations to limit methane pollution were among those that Trump's  Executive order singled out, saying, ``As soon as practical, suspend,  revise, or rescind [them].''  Step 3 was to write a do-nothing replacement. After lots of dawdling,  Trump's corrupt EPA decided to draft a fake rule, a rule they could  point to if challenged in court for doing nothing, but a rule that  would conveniently do nothing to limit methane emissions. The fake rule  exempts a huge chunk of oil and gas production from regulation, leaving  the industry with an effective blank check to pollute as much methane  as it likes.  As I speak, the corrupt Trump EPA is preparing to issue its final  rule, and the corrupted fossil fuel industry is poised to grab  everything it wanted. The final rule is one that industry stooges could  have written themselves because, well, it looks like they did write it  themselves. They bought that privilege the old-fashioned way, by buying  it.  Even before Trump took office, the fossil fuel industry began  showering him with money. Trump raised a record amount for his  inauguration--nearly doubling the previous record--and Hess, Chevron,  BP, Citgo, ExxonMobil, Consol Energy, Continental Resources, Murray  Energy, and Valero all made six- or seven-figure donations. The oil and  gas and mining sector was the second largest source of donations,  providing more than $10 million to Trump's inaugural committee. That  money still flows as the 2020 election ramps up.  Fossil fuel companies are among the largest donors to the political  group supporting Trump's reelection. A pipeline company is the largest  single donor to the Trump victory political action committee, more than  $700,000 as of this November. The oil, gas, and mining industries  account for more than $5 million to the Trump Victory PAC.  Fossil fuel executives are some of the largest individual donors to  the Trump Victory PAC. One executive alone gave $360,000. These known  donations likely represent the tip of a big dark iceberg. Dark-money  political organizations accept unlimited donations and provide no  disclosure, and Super PACs accept unlimited donations with little  disclosure. So the bottom line is we cannot tell exactly how much  fossil fuel money is flowing to groups supporting Trump, but it is a  lot. When you consider the $650 billion annual subsidiary the fossil  fuel polluters enjoy, they have every reason to buy control over  government from a corrupt Trump administration.  Money isn't the only way the fossil fuel industry exerts control.  Oklahoma oil king and Scott Pruitt patron Harold Hamm set up a Trump  leadership council to advise Trump. The fossil fuel industry was the  heart of the council, with coal giants Alliance Resource Partners and  Murray Energy, oil services company Baker Hughes, and natural gas  company Devon Energy all active members. Of course, there was the  National Association of Manufacturers, a trade association recently  identified as America's worst climate obstructer.  With all these obstructers and polluters on board, the fossil fuel  friendly [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7122\">Page S7122</a>, ] council fed Trump a steady diet of talking points about slashing  regulations and achieving ``complete American energy independence.''  These fossil fuel industry talking points became the Executive order  I mentioned earlier, an order to kill any environmental protection that  ``unduly burdens the development of domestic energy resources.'' Do you  want to know who the winners were from that Executive order? Check the  list of attendees at the signing ceremony: fossil fuel executives and  fossil fuel industry trade association executives, come to celebrate  the freedom to pollute that their influence and money had bought them.  Chevron has recently been identified as one of the companies that has  done the most to damage our oceans. They are one of the top ocean- wrecking companies on the planet. In February of 2017, Chevron wrote to  the corrupt Pruitt with a list of deregulatory proposals the company  wanted to see implemented at the EPA. Included was a request to  ``refocus methane regulations, particularly those that impact existing  sources, to encourage voluntary approaches.'' For sure, you can trust  one of the world's worst ocean polluters with voluntary approaches.  The corrupt Trump EPA was stocked with fossil fuel industry cronies  ready to implement whatever the industry wanted. Pruitt rose to  political power on a wave of fossil fuel money and demonstrated a  willingness to sell his office by putting fossil fuel industry asks  verbatim onto his official letterhead.  Andrew Wheeler, Pruitt's successor as Administrator, had been a  leading lobbyist for the coal industry. The head of the EPA Air Office,  Bill Wehrum, rose to prominence by helping build and run an array of  trade associations and front groups for--guess what--the fossil fuel  industry.  Beyond Pruitt and Wheeler and Wehrum, the EPA's political leadership  crawled with fossil fuel flunkies, like the one who left to set up the  fossil-fuel dark energy group Energy 45 to help promote fossil fuel  energy policies; or the lawyer-lobbyist for energy interests Dominion  Energy, Koch Industries, and TransCanada overseeing Air Office  compliance, of all things. It has been an infestation.  It is easy for the fossil fuel industry to spend big money to corrupt  the EPA because the corruption payback is so big; the dirty methane  work alone is estimated to save oil and gas companies hundreds of  millions of dollars.  Meanwhile, the American Petroleum Institute, the largest trade  association for the oil and gas industry, announced a new seven-figure  ad campaign called ``We're on it.'' ``We're on it.'' These ads--on the  Internet, TV, and billboards--they are all over the Washington, DC,  airport. They are designed to fool the public and to fool policymakers  that the oil industry is ``on its'' methane emissions problem. Of  course, they are not. Of course, they are lying. It is what they do.  Science tells us that methane emissions are far higher than the  estimates out of the corrupt Trump EPA. The investigative journalism  group Unearthed found that leading oil companies are emitting  unprecedented methane pollution. In just three producing basins, in  just 1 year, oil companies emitted methane equivalent to the annual  emissions of 10 coal-fired power plants or 8 million cars.  There is a recent New York Times article that you can link to showing  infrared imagery--it is really impressive to see, actually, if you  click through to it--infrared imagery of methane billowing out of what  they call super-emitter fossil fuel facilities.  A recent article described one methane blowout in Ohio leaking as  much ``methane than the entire oil and gas industries of many nations  do in a year.''  ``We are on it.'' Yeah, they are ``on it.'' What they are on is a  binge of lying about emissions, corrupting our politics, and blocking  climate action. These massive polluting industries have a long track  record of climate denial and deceit. It is how they roll.  A top climate obstructer, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, pays for a  phony study, claiming the Paris agreement would cost jobs and economic  growth, and Trump pulls out a pass. Oil companies lobby to gut auto  fuel efficiency standards, and Pruitt and Wheeler gut the standards.  The natural gas industry objects to rules limiting methane emission.  The corrupt Trump EPA rolls them back.  Just now, on the Senate floor, we are looking at a tax extenders  package that wipes out the tax extenders for solar going forward, wind  going forward. They gave us 1 year looking backwards. Great, thanks a  bunch. Electric vehicles, storage, and batteries, all of that had been  in a tentative agreement. The fossil fuel industry and the Trump  administration kiboshed all of it. ``On it,'' indeed.  Will Attorney General Barr look into any of this? Of course not. In  the corrupt Trump administration, fossil fuel money and influence puts  that industry above the law. They can pollute and corrupt more or less  at will. We cannot afford this self-dealing from polluters any longer.  This is flat-out wrong. Indeed, it is flat-out crooked. It is not only  time to wake up, Madam President, it is time to clean up. This behavior  is a disgrace.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. WYDEN": " Mr. WYDEN. Thank you for that background, Mr. Chairman. I agree with  you that it is clear that the benefit some in the oil and gas industry  are seeking from this provision is illegitimate. However, given the  significant amount of taxpayer dollars at stake should these companies  somehow prevail in litigation, it is also important for Congress to  provide clarity in this area, to protect the public purse. The tax  package under consideration in the spending bill addresses this by  amending the alternative fuel mixture credit to more explicitly deny  the credit for butane mixed with gasoline, consistent congressional  intent. This clarification is effective for any claims filed on or  after January 8, 2018, when the IRS issued a formal revenue ruling  putting taxpayers on notice that a mixture of butane and gasoline does  not qualify for the credit. However, this does not mean we agree that  such mixtures prior to January 8, 2018, qualify for the credit, and, in  fact, we are of the opinion that they do not. Do you agree Mr.  Chairman?    ", "Mr. SULLIVAN": " Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is that time of week in which I get  to come down to the floor of the U.S. Senate--a great privilege--and  talk about a special person in Alaska, somebody who helps to make my  State the greatest State in the country, in my opinion. We call this  person our Alaskan of the Week. It is one of the best things I get to  do all week. I know that the pages really enjoy it as well because they  get to hear about Alaska and all of the things that are happening.  Before I recognize our special Alaskan, let me tell you a little bit  about what is going on in Alaska right now.  We have had some strange weather in Southcentral Alaska--warm by our  standards--that being wet and windy, with gusts over 100 miles per hour  in some places. In Fairbanks, which is in the interior--I was just up  there last week and am going to talk about that, for it is where our  special Alaskan of the Week is from--it feels a lot more like winter.  It got down to 27 below zero last week, and now it is in the single  digits.  When it comes to Alaska's interior weather, there is some debate as  to what the lowest recordbreaking temperature was in Fairbanks. Some  say it was 66 below zero in 1934, and others say it was in the negative  70 and 70-below-zero territory.  The numbers do matter. Take it from Dr. Hugh ``Bud'' Fate, who is our  Alaskan of the Week--we call him Bud--who, during the time he was  working construction on the North Slope in the early 1950s, once had to  walk a mile for shelter after a tractor he was operating froze up.  ``When I got to the station, they told me the official temperature  was 70 degrees below zero,'' he said. ``I was dressed for it''--Bud is  a tough guy--``but my fingers and my toes were getting cold. I don't  think I could have made another mile,'' Bud said.  Bud, we know you could have. We know you could have.  That is just one of many stories that Bud tells about his 70 years of  living in the great State of Alaska.  So let me talk about Bud Fate--a legend across our State. He just  turned 90 years old last week. He has been a rodeo cowboy, a college  football player, a roughneck, a soldier, a gold miner, a carpenter, a  hunter, a commercial and subsistence fisherman, a dog musher, a bush  pilot, a dentist, a businessman, a State representative, an author, an  artist, an all-around rabble-rouser, and an Alaskan renaissance man  through and through.  But most importantly, he is a dedicated father, grandfather, husband  to his wife, Mary Jane, for 65 years, and a man who has lived his life  in service to his country, his State, and his community--very worthy of  being our Alaskan of the Week.  So Bud Fate was born on December 4, 1929--90 years ago last week--and  raised in Eastern Oregon--Cowtown, he called it. He began riding a  horse when he was just 6 years old, eventually riding on the rodeo  circuit, getting bucked off horses all across the American West.  He went to college at the University of Washington, where he  initially played football. After he got hurt, he enrolled in a drama  class and had dreams, when he made his way to California, to Hollywood,  to work as an actor or as a stuntman in cowboy movies and films.  As it turned out, it wasn't California that called him; it was Alaska  that called him--specifically, a good job in the far north of Alaska, a  place called Umiat, working on oil rigs not too far away from what  would become the biggest oil find ever in North America, the mammoth  field at Prudhoe Bay. Bud was 20 years old, working 12 hours a day, 7  days a week. Even though it was a barren and cold, cold place--this was  in the winter--he fell in love with it. Alaska grabbed him, as it does  to certain types of adventuresome, intelligent, and fiercely  independent individuals.  It grabbed Bud, and it didn't let go--never let go. He was one of the  drillers working on the shift which brought the first oil to the  surface that came out of this rig in Umiat. Bud likes to describe it as  this almost beautiful orange color, some of the first oil in Alaska in  the fifties, early fifties--pretty exciting.  He was working on the slope when, in 1950, a radio message came in  where they were working that the United States was at war in Korea.  Bud said:  I remember thinking it wouldn't affect me way up here on   the North Slope of Alaska. Nobody is going to find me, a 20-  year-old, but 2 weeks later, I got my first draft notice.  That is what Bud said. I guess it goes to show you Uncle Sam can find  you anywhere if he wants you.  As a U.S. Army corporal, Bud was attached to the 11th Airborne  Division when he got deployed not to Korea but actually back to Alaska.  He was charged with riding the lead Jeep to conduct the combat survey  on all the twists and turns of the newly constructed, 1,700-mile-long  Alcan Highway, advising the mission commanders about the Arctic, cold  weather, and Alaska.  A couple of years later, he was out of the Army, back in Alaska, and  he was having a drink one night at the famous Rendezvous Club in  Fairbanks, a tongue-tied veteran, he was, and in walks a Miss Alaska  contestant--or should I say, from Bud's perspective, in walks destiny.  Whom am I talking about? Who was the destiny?  Well, it is Mary Jane Evans, a young, smart--according to Bud-- ``Hollywood beautiful'' Athabaskan woman from the small Yukon River  village of Rampart. She took his breath away. As a matter of fact, she  took everybody's breath away.  Now, Bud, at this event, was wearing moccasins. Mary Jane was wearing  stilettos, and she promptly stepped on his toes, but it was still love  at first sight for both of them, and according to Bud, it still is, 65  years later. For 65 years, they forged a life together, Bud and Mary  Jane, the theme of which centered around public service.  Always working together, they raised three beautiful, kind and keenly  intelligent daughters--keenly intelligent--and they worked to  fundamentally change Alaska for the better, both through institutions  and volunteering at organizations and through individual actions that  profoundly impacted so many Alaskans over the years. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7023\">Page S7023</a>, ]  Eventually Bud, using the GI bill, went back to college, and then he  went to get his degree in dentistry. He was a beloved dentist not only  in Fairbanks but all across the region.  Now, he was a bush pilot, and he had a plane, so he and Mary Jane,  who was a trained dental assistant, traveled all around the small  villages in the interior.  Trust me, these villages do not and certainly back then did not have  any dental care, so they provided dental care throughout the interior  to tiny, little communities for free, for anybody who needed it.  As their three daughters were growing up--Janine, Jennifer, and  Julie--it was a big time, a momentous time, in Alaska.  The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act was being debated. One of the  biggest land settlements in American or all history took place right  here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.  Bud and Mary Jane were both highly involved in this monumentally  important bill for Alaska and in the overarching efforts to attain  rights and lands for the Alaska Native people.  One of Bud's best friends was Ralph Perdue, a strong Alaska Native  leader, who, along with Mary Jane and Bud, founded the Fairbanks Native  Association. Working together, they focused heavily on education for  Alaska Natives, particularly high school education, something most  Americans take for granted. Until 1970, rural Alaska--a huge swath of  America--by and large did not have any high schools. The small  communities, small villages, did not have any high schools. To get a  high school education, young students and even children had to leave  their homes and their villages and travel to boarding schools in very  faraway places in Alaska and in the lower 48.  Now, that was an injustice--one, among others, that the Fairbanks  Native Association decided to tackle. They produced studies. They gave  lectures. They talked to State officials. They talked to Federal  officials. They and so many others across the State helped lay the  groundwork for the seminal lawsuit brought by a group of Alaskans that  resulted in a State-signed consent decree to provide high schools in  communities throughout the State--communities with at least 15  students--rather than sending their children all across Alaska,  hundreds of miles away, or to the lower 48, thousands of miles away.  At the time, this education settlement was the largest education  settlement in American history, but Bud's commitment to education  didn't stop there--not even close. He was on the Board of Regents for  the University of Alaska, eventually serving as president of the  university. It should be noted that later, Mary Jane, his wife, also  served on this very important board.  With a combined 24 years of service together, Bud and Mary Jane were  on the University of Alaska Board of Regents. Bud helped run the  university when the president abruptly resigned.  He and Mary Jane also opened their home to villagers all across the  State who came to Fairbanks and just needed a place to stay. They knew  that Bud and Mary Jane would take them in. ``Our house was always  full,'' their lovely daughter Julie said.  There were always people living with us who were empowering   themselves through education. To this day, I still have   Alaskans stop to tell me how they were helped and given a   second chance by my parents.  As Julie also noted, there was always a huge amount of smoked salmon  strips on the table for all to share--the best smoked salmon in Alaska,  I might add.  There is so much more to Bud Fate's life. For instance, at the young,  tender age of 70, he decided he was going to run for office. He ran for  the State legislature, and he won in a landslide. He served two terms.  He was immediately elected chairman of the Natural Resources Committee,  which is a huge, important committee in Alaska, and was highly  respected on both sides of the aisle.  The list of boards and commissions that he sat on is way too long to  go into here, as is the list of service organizations he has  volunteered for and led.  He has known Presidents of countries and dignitaries from all over  the globe. He is as comfortable at his fish camp on the Yukon River as  he is in the board room.  As I mentioned, he is a rabble rouser with very strong opinions--I  have heard them for many years, but at heart all of his opinions are  focused on a commitment to treat everybody with respect and kindness  and provide every Alaskan--every American--an opportunity to better  themselves.  He is a good man--Bud Fate--one of the best. The measure of Bud and  the impact of his life is probably best reflected in his family and his  friends, so many of whom gathered in Fairbanks on December 4 for his  90th birthday, where people from all walks of life all across the State  came together--well over 100--talked about his generosity, how it  impacted them, how it impacted families, and how it impacted people all  around him.  People gave speeches about how he and Mary Jane took in people from  all walks of life--veterans coming back from Vietnam who needed comfort  and respect, people who needed a helping hand, food, warmth, just love.  He lifted people up, so did Mary Jane, and they saved lives.  I was actually one of those people giving a speech in Fairbanks at  Bud's 90th birthday party, and I talked about the profound impact Bud  has had on my own life--after all, Bud Fate is my father-in-law, and I  can't imagine a better one.  He has taught me so much. Bud and Mary Jane, along with my own mom  and dad, have provided me a model--actually, for me and Julie, my wife,  of what a true partnership looks like. He is a model for how fulfilling  a life of service can be, especially a life in the great State of  Alaska.  As I mentioned, he is not just a model for me but for the whole State  of a life well lived and a life lived in full.  So, Bud, thanks for all you have done for Alaska, for America, for  Fairbanks, for our family, for our great State, and all you continue to  do. Thanks for being a great father-in-law and a friend, and, Bud,  congratulations on being our Alaskan of the Week.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. ENZI": " Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory  limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to  those limits. In addition, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to  establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels  consistent with those adjustments.  The Senate will soon consider two measures: the House amendment to  the Senate amendment to ', H.R. 1158, ', the Consolidated Appropriations Act,  2020, and the House amendment to the Senate amendment to ', H.R. 1865, ', the  Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020. These measures contain  spending that qualifies for cap adjustments under current law.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 includes multiple instances  of cap adjustment eligible spending. The measure includes $70,855  million in spending designated as being for overseas contingency  operations, OCO, funding pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of  BBEDCA. This budget authority, all of which falls into the revised  security category, would result in $40,336 million in outlays in fiscal  year 2020. The measure further includes $17,503 million in spending  designated for disaster relief pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(D) of  BBEDCA. This budget authority, all of which falls into the revised  nonsecurity category, would result in $984 million in outlays. The  measure also includes $1,771 million in revised security category  budget authority that is designated as an emergency pursuant to section  251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA. CBO estimates that this budget authority, as  well as other emergency designated changes, would increase net outlays  by $914 million this fiscal year.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, also includes $2,500  million in nonsecurity budget authority that is designated as being for  the periodic U.S. Census pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(G) of BBEDCA.  CBO estimates that this budget authority will result in $1,800 million  in outlays in fiscal year 2020. Earlier this year, I made an adjustment  to accommodate funding in this amount for this purpose and reaffirm  those funds for use for this measure.  The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 also includes  multiple instances of cap adjustment eligible spending. The measure  includes $8,645 million in spending designated as being for OCO funding  pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of BBEDCA. This budget authority,  $645 million of which falls into the revised security category and  $8,000 million falls into the revised nonsecurity category, would  result in $2,327 million in outlays in fiscal year 2020. The measure  includes $1,842 million in spending designated for program integrity  pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(B), section 251(b)(2)(C), and section  251(b)(2)(E) of BBEDCA. This budget authority, all of which falls into  the revised nonsecurity category, would result in $1,481 million in  outlays. The measure also includes $6,764 million in revised  nonsecurity category budget authority that is designated as an  emergency pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA. CBO estimates  that this budget authority, as well as other emergency designated  changes, would increase net outlays by $1,705 million this fiscal year.  The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 also includes  $2,250 million in nonsecurity discretionary budget authority for  wildfire suppression operations pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(F) of  BBEDCA. This budget authority and its associated outlays of $2,250  million qualify for an adjustment under the law. Earlier this year, I  made an adjustment to accommodate funding in this amount for this  purpose and reaffirm those funds for use for this measure. As such, I  am revising the budget authority and outlay allocations to the  Committee on Appropriations by increasing revised nonsecurity budget  authority by $27,880 million, revised security budget authority by  $79,500 million, and general outlays by $47,747 million in fiscal year  2020. Further, I am increasing the budgetary aggregate for fiscal year  2020 by $107,126 million in budget authority and $47,534 million in  outlays.  I ask unanimous consent that this notice and the accompanying tables,  which provide details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows: ", "Mr. KING": " Mr. KING. Mr. President, on rollcall vote No. 397, I voted no. It was  my intention to vote yea; therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I be  permitted to change my vote since it will not affect the outcome.    ", "Ms. BALDWIN": " Ms. BALDWIN. I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. JOHNSON": " Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to ask the Senate to confirm  Mr. Chad Wolf to be the Under Secretary of the Office of Strategy,  Policy, and Plans at the Department of Homeland Security.  The Under Secretary of the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans  leads an office of over 150 employees with an annual budget of over $37  million to develop and implement DHS policy, long-term goals, and  strategic plans. Chad Wolf has extensive experience in homeland  security policy, starting in 2002 working as the chief of staff helping  to stand up the new Transportation Security Administration after 9/11  and then as the Assistant Administrator for that agency.  He left government and spent over a decade working on homeland  security policy issues as a consultant in the private sector. Mr. Wolf  returned to public service and the Department of Homeland Security in  2017, serving as chief of staff at TSA, chief of staff to the  Secretary, and now as the Assistant Secretary of Strategy, Plans,  Analysis & Risk. Since February of this year, he has been the senior  official performing the duties of the Under Secretary of the Office of  Strategy, Policy, and Plans, the office for which we are now  considering his nomination.  The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  approved his nomination on a bipartisan basis on July 24. As we all  know, the Department has a number of Senate-confirmed leadership  positions vacant. Currently, 7 of the 18 DHS offices requiring Senate  confirmation are vacant. Three of those vacant positions have nominees  that have been languishing on the Senate floor for months after being  approved by my committee with bipartisan support.  Mr. Wolf's nomination has been pending in the Senate for almost 9  months. Troy Edgar, the nominee to be the Department's Chief Financial  Officer, has been pending in the Senate for 8 months, and William  Bryan, the nominee to be Under Secretary for Science and Technology,  has been pending for over 4 months. All three nominees were approved by  my committee with bipartisan support. We are holding a hearing to  consider Mr. Peter Gaynor as the President's nominee to head FEMA this  week.  Dedicated Americans serving at DHS in acting positions are doing  admirable jobs under oftentimes difficult circumstances. I trust that  Chad Wolf will do the same if he is asked to step aside from his role  as Under Secretary to serve temporarily as Acting Secretary upon Kevin  McAleenan's departure.  I fully expect and I call upon the President to nominate a permanent  Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security. When he does, my  committee will consider the nominee expeditiously. We need confirmed  leadership at DHS to help direct the Department as it works to keep  Americans safe.  We need confirmed leadership at DHS to help direct the Department as  it works to keep Americans safe. I am grateful to Chad Wolf for his  willingness to serve in this position, and I encourage my colleagues to  support his confirmation.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    ", "Mr. CARPER": " Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want to share with the Senate my reasons  for opposing the nomination of Aurelia Skipwith to serve as the  Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Let me begin by saying that I am disappointed to find myself in this  position. When I had the privilege of serving as Governor of Delaware,  I was able to assemble my own leadership team, so I appreciate how  important it is that people in executive positions, including  Presidents, have that same ability.  However, in article II of the Constitution, our Founders set up a  system in which the President would nominate individuals to the top  posts in our government and Senators would provide ``advice and  consent'' on those nominees.  In order for the Senate to fulfill that constitutional role, those  nominated individuals must cooperate with the confirmation process.  And, unfortunately, Ms. Skipwith has not provided information requested  by the Democrats during the nomination process.  Despite my repeated requests for the nominee to be more forthcoming-- requests made twice in writing and twice in person. during her  nomination process--Ms. Skipwith has refused. Instead, she has given me  the impression that she does not take this confirmation process  seriously.  Her lack of candor has elevated questions that already existed about  her qualifications, her commitment to environmental conservation and  whether she can ethically lead the Fish and Wildlife Service.  Therefore, I cannot support this nomination.  Ms. Skipwith first joined the Trump administration in April 2017.  when she was appointed as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Fish and  Wildlife and Parks, a non-Senate-confirmed political appointment at the  Department of the Interior.  During her tenure there, the Fish and Wildlife Service proposed and  finalized controversial regulations that drastically altered  implementation of the Endangered Species Act.  The Service has also issued a legal opinion that changes the way the  Department of the Interior enforces the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.  Former senior Interior officials from every administration since the  early 1970s, both Republican and Democrat, have strongly opposed this  Migratory Bird Treaty Act legal opinion. At her confirmation hearing,  Ms. Skipwith vehemently defended it.  Prior to her controversial tenure at the Interior Department, Ms.  Skipwith had no previous work experience related to conservation or  wildlife management--none.  By contrast, the 16 individuals who previously served as Fish and  Wildlife Service Directors for both Republican and Democratic  Presidents had an estimated average of 12 years of experience at the  Fish and Wildlife Service before taking on the Director role. They also  have an estimated average of more than 22 years of professional  experience in fields related to wildlife or fisheries management.  Ms. Skipwith has also not seemed to make up for her lack of previous  experience while on the job. At her confirmation hearing, when asked to  name the conservation scientist who had most influenced her career and  her approach to wildlife and fisheries management, Ms. Skipwith  struggled to name any conservation scientist. Ultimately, she named a  former Monsanto vice president with whom she used to work, but she  misremembered his name.  This was not an insignificant misstep. To me, it was revealing. Ms.  Skipwith's response to my simple question represented a clear lack of  familiarity with the basics of wildlife management, a troubling quality  for a Fish and Wildlife Director nominee.  By contrast, Ms. Skipwith does have significant experience in the  agribusiness industry. Before joining the Trump administration, she  worked for Monsanto, one of the world's largest agrochemical firms.  Monsanto regularly has business interests before the Interior  Department. She also worked for Alltech, a Kentucky-based agricultural  products company.  She also co-founded AVC Global, an agribusiness-technology start up,  and was employed by Gage International, a Washington, DC, based  lobbying firm founded by her fiance.  That is why even before her confirmation hearing, I asked Ms.  Skipwith some basic questions about how these companies operate and [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7009\">Page S7009</a>, ] whether Ms. Skipwith has recused herself from working on those issues.  Unfortunately, Ms. Skipwith has refused to answer those questions.  She has repeatedly refused to provide her calendars with the  appointments she has had as a Department of the Interior official. This  information could be made available to any member of the public under  the Freedom of Information Act, but she has refused to provide it to me  for months within the confirmation process.  This information is important because Ms. Skipwith's former employer,  Gage International, has represented water utilities that have lobbied  Congress to weaken Western water policy and the Endangered Species Act.  Unanswered questions also remain about Ms. Skipwith's role in the  development of a controversial repeal of an existing ban on using  pesticides that have been shown to harm birds and bees in national  wildlife refuges. And one of the largest producers of these pesticides  is Monsanto, another one of Ms. Skipwith's former employers.  Yet when Senator Gillibrand asked Ms. Skipwith about her role in the  ban's repeal, Ms. Skipwith defended the reversal but denied any role in  the decision. This answer does not appear to be consistent with some of  the email records that have been obtained under Freedom of Information  Act, which show that she expressed interest in the matter and received  materials on the issue from career staff.  If Ms. Skipwith was indeed involved with the decision to reverse the  pesticides ban, it would constitute a violation of the ethics pledge  she signed when she joined the Department. An examination of Ms.  Skipwith's calendar entries could clear up these outstanding questions,  but her lack of cooperation makes that impossible.  This lack of being forthcoming is troubling, not only because it  undermines the Senate's advice and consent role for Presidential  nominees, but it also because it demonstrates the nominee's may not be  cooperative when it comes to congressional oversight.  I have found that, when a nominee is unwilling to provide information  as part of their confirmation process, they almost always prove to be  even more defiant to congressional oversight requests after they are  confirmed.  I urge my colleagues. especially my Republican colleagues, to take  this matter seriously. In fact, I would urge my Republican colleagues  to remember these words spoken by my friend, former Congressman Trey  Gowdy of South Carolina.  In June 2012, during the House Oversight and Government Reform  Committee contempt proceedings against Attorney General Holder, then  Congressman Gowdy said: ``The notion that you can withhold information  and documents from Congress no matter whether you are the party in  power or not in power is wrong. Respect for the rule of law must mean  something, irrespective of the vicissitudes of political cycles.''  Eventually, whether it is in 1 year or in 4 years or in 8, we will  eventually have another Democratic administration. And when that time  comes, Republicans in Congress will want officials in that Democratic  administration to answer questions and respond to congressional  oversight requests.  I fear that my Senate colleagues will find the process completely  broken by then if we continue undermining our duty as Senators to both  provide advice and consent on Presidential nomination and to conduct  congressional oversight.  This clear defiance of our sworn constitutional duty and  congressional oversight role diminishes the Senate, weakens our  intricate system of checks and balances, and undermines the trust of  the American people.  Beyond her lack of qualifications and her questionable role in some  of this administration's major conservation policies, there are too  many troubling concerns and questions about this nominee that remain  unaddressed or unanswered.  Therefore, I will be opposing this nomination, and I encourage my  colleagues to do the same.    ", "Mr. HOEVEN": " Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I would just like to say how much I  appreciate Senator Cramer, the working relationship that we have, not  just here but a working relationship that goes back many, many years.  As you can tell, he speaks very well, but what comes through is not  only his commitment to his family and his faith, but his commitment to  the people of North Dakota and his commitment to the people of this  country.  It doesn't matter what issue he is working on. He takes the time to  listen to everybody, and he is always willing to explain where he is  coming from and why he comes to the conclusion he does. But there is no  question, he loves his faith; he loves his family; he loves his State;  and he loves this country.  Thank you, Madam President.  I yield the floor. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7074\">Page S7074</a>, ]    ", "Mr. CRAMER": " Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, before I begin my comments about an  upcoming nominee, I want to say in response to Senator Kennedy that I  agree 100 percent. Thank you.  Nomination of Daniel Mack Traynor  Mr. President, later today the Senate will have the opportunity to  vote on President Trump's second nomination to the U.S. District Court  for North Dakota. My friend, Dan Traynor, has been nominated and we  will be voting on his confirmation to be district judge for our  district.  I have known Dan for a long time. That is why I was honored to  recommend him to the President and pleased when the President nominated  him earlier this year.  Dan received his bachelor's degree from the University of North  Dakota and his jurist doctorate from the University of North Dakota  School of Law. He clerked for the legendary chief justice of the North  Dakota Supreme Court, Gerald VandeWalle, before heading to Devils Lake,  ND, where he joined his family's law firm and where he works today.  Since that time, he has spent a couple of decades in various  capacities, practicing various types of law, including being the  assistant city attorney for Devils Lake. His extensive criminal and  civil experience both as a prosecutor and defender in State and Federal  courts and also in Tribal court are the main qualifications I think he  brings to this important position. Again, I am honored to support him.  He has tried about 80-plus cases to a verdict or judgment or to a  final decision, which I think is very good experience for somebody who  is then going to stand in judgment. In addition, the ABA gave him a  unanimous ``well qualified'' rating. He has also been recognized since  2015 as a ``super lawyer.'' In 2017 he received Martindale-Hubbell's  ``AV Preeminent Rating.''  So Dan's academic record, experience, and qualifications are more  than adequate to be a good district judge. What makes him an exception  is that Dan and his wife Trish, who is an Air Force veteran, are  raising a beautiful family and are what we call pillars of their  community and our State. As for Dan's family, his mom and dad, Jack and  Jane, I know quite well, and they are what we would call legends in  their community and in our State.  The bottom line is that Dan is eminently qualified in every way,  including possessing the character, demeanor, and temperament, as well  as the intellectual capacity, to be an excellent judge. I look forward  to voting for him, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    ", "Mr. CRAPO": " Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator James Risch, Representative Mike Simpson, and Representative Russ Fulcher, I pay tribute to Idahoan Bill Lowry, who was deeply respected among his peers and beyond, having earned a wonderful reputation with hard work and integrity. His wisdom, good will, and stature helped inspire the development of the Owyhee Initiative, which we expect to help secure the future of ranching families and the culture of Owyhee County. The following is Bill's obituary honoring the life of this great American: ``William `Bill' Anson Lowry was born June 6, 1921 to Charles and Sally Lowry joining a sister, Hazel in Bend, Oregon. He was later joined by 3 brothers (Bob, Al, and Richard) and 7 more sisters (Effa, Gladys, Rhonda, Alta, Dorothy, Betty Jean, and Peggy). The family lived in Prineville, Oregon where Bill began school. They moved a couple times but landed back in Prineville where Bill graduated from the 8th grade. After his 8th grade graduation, he began working for the Stearns Cattle Company of Prineville. His Army discharge report listed his civilian occupation as `cowpuncher'. Bill always had a lot of respect for the Stearns family and they became his second family. It was there that he met the love of his life, Vernita `Nita' Hein, who was working in the cookhouse. In 1942 after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Bill was drafted into the United States Army. However, his induction was pushed back because of the flood of boys enlisting. Bill always wanted to honor the boys who quit school and rushed to enlist, describing many of them as being too young to shave. He related his experience and desire to honor these young men to Idaho State Representative Christy Zito at a meeting in Pleasant Valley. Christy then told his story to her friend, Brian Arnold, who composed a poem entitled Too Young to Shave. Through the good work of the Idaho Chapter of Dream Catchers, the poem is now engraved on a marble plaque and displayed in the Warhawk Museum in Nampa, Idaho, fulfilling his dream of honoring these young men. While on leave from his time in the Army Corps of Engineers, he married Nita on July 31, 1945. He was discharged in November of the same year and the young couple returned to Bill's job on the Stearns ranch. The couple began to save their money to realize their dream of owning their own ranch. They worked hard, lived simply, and saved every penny they could even with the addition of their sons, Tim and Mike. Eventually they were able to lease a couple of ranches, later purchasing a ranch in Pleasant Valley, Idaho in 1965. One of Bill's greatest joys in life was working on his ranch and with his Hereford cattle. His love (some would say obsession) for Hereford cattle came from his years of working for the Stearns and with their reputation commercial and registered Hereford cattle. His passions were family, Hereford cattle, thoroughbred saddle horses, conservative politics, education, and unwavering patriotism. Bill is survived by his sons and their families, Tim (Rosa Maria) and Mike (Gaylene); 10 siblings; 5 grandkids--Mirren Lowry, Amaya (Jim) O'Connor, Luke Lowry, Micki (Kevin) Golden, and Melissa (Cody) Bullock; and 9 great- grandchildren. He is preceded in death by his parents, Charles and Sally Lowry; oldest sister, Hazel; and wife, Nita. His family would like to express their deepest appreciation to the staff and residents of Grace Assisted Living in Nampa and the First Choice Hospice caregivers for their kindness to and care of Bill. He was grateful for all of you!'' The poem titled ``Too Young to Shave'' by Brian Arnold that was inspired by Bill and referenced in his obituary follows: ``His body was gnarled and twisted, like a wind-blown juniper tree He'd seen the sunrise and seen the sun set more times than two of me. Hobbling from his truck using two canes, so I stopped and held the door He said, `I'm here for the Town Hall meetin'. Is that what you're here for?' I wondered aloud why a ninety-year-old man even cared about civic affairs He said, `Let me tell you a story.' So I grabbed a couple of chairs. `When Pearl Harbor was bombed a bunch of us boys all went into town to join up From the farms and ranches, and some from in town, we had an enemy to whup. They took down our names and gave us a number, then said they'd give us a call So many young fellers were signing up that they couldn't process them all. Was a whole lot of youngsters standin in line, see they was lyin about their age All ready to die for our country, while still too young to shave. It took a few months before they got to us all, `cause so many wanted to go I was an infantryman in the Army, a regular G.I. Joe.

Madam President, this explanation reflects the status of  negotiations and disposition of issues reached between the House  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Select  Committee on Intelligence for the Damon Paul Nelson and Matthew Young  Pollard Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2018, 2019, and  2020. This bill is named after two dedicated staffers--Matthew Young  Pollard of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and Damon Paul  Nelson of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence--whose  contributions to America will have an enduring, positive impact on our  national security.  The explanation shall have the same effect with respect to the  implementation of this act as if it were a joint explanatory statement  of a conference committee. The explanation comprises three parts: an  overview of the application of the annex to accompany this statement,  unclassified congressional direction, and a section-by-section analysis  of the legislative text.  I ask unanimous consent that the Joint Explanatory Statement for the  Damon Paul Nelson and Matthew Young Pollard Intelligence Authorization  Act for Fiscal Years 2018, 2019, and 2020 be printed into the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows: ", "Mr. LEE": " Mr. LEE. Madam President, where I come from in Utah, $700 million is  a lot of money. Seven hundred million dollars is something we ought to  worry about where we are going to get it.  It is not unreasonable for us to request that the House of  Representatives agree to the language we unanimously, on a bipartisan  basis, passed out of the Senate Commerce Committee.  In my mind, it is unfortunate that we are allowing the House of  Representatives' unreasonable, unwarranted demand--a demand the  chairman of the Commerce Committee himself acknowledges is one they  shouldn't object to--to rule the day and prevent this legislation from  becoming law.

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    ", "Ms. WARREN": " Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    ", "Ms. CANTWELL": " Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from  Massachusetts, who has been a leader on this important issue of net  neutrality. I want to speak and back up what he said today about why it  is so important and that we need to fight to protect a free and open  internet, before I do, I would just like to mention that yesterday we  filed a bill dealing with trade enforcement.  The reason I bring that up is because today there is going to be a  lot of discussion about trade writ large. It is very important that in  the trade discussion, we also have trade enforcement. Much of what we  filed yesterday is what we hope to see in an agreement that is now  being unveiled, and this builds on capacity building, which is very  important. We want to make sure we have the enforcement capabilities at  USTR and now the capacity and enforcement in Mexico to make these  agreements work in the future. I look forward to discussing that with  my colleagues.  I am really here to talk about how 2 years ago, the Trump  administration, basically, with the FCC at the helm, repealed net  neutrality and put Big Cable in charge of our internet future. Despite  83 percent of all Americans and a majority of Independents, Democrats,  and Republicans supporting a free and open internet--that means making  sure they weren't charged excessive rates--the FCC chose to side with  cable companies.  Not long after, Verizon throttled the broadband service of Santa  Clara firefighters in California when they were in the midst of  fighting the massive Mendocino Complex Fire in 2018. Despite  firefighters' urgent pleas to stop [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S6917\">Page S6917</a>, ] the throttling, Verizon refused to do so.  For those who don't understand what throttling is, we are always  concerned that without rules of the road, companies would slow down  some access to internet sites. This is so important because we don't  want an internet that is based on how much you pay for faster broadband  access.  We think that to slow down important sites like public service sites  or any sites or to base an internet on how much you pay is the wrong  direction. More importantly, we need to make sure we are policing this.  Even today, as we have no Federal agency with clear authority to adopt  hard and fast rules to keep that situation from happening again, we  need to keep fighting.  Another example is that wireless carriers have been accused of  potentially throttling subscribers to Netflix, YouTube, and Sprint and  allegedly interfering with Skype services. Again, that is another  example of why we have to keep our message about a free and open  internet no matter where we look, where we live, or where we are  accessing the internet.  It is long past time for the Senate to vote on the Save the Internet  Act--something on which our colleague from Massachusetts has been a  leader.  Our bill would restore the protections for a free and open internet  that were had by the Obama FCC in 2015, which would mean no blocking,  throttling, or paid prioritization would be allowed. The FCC would have  the flexible legal standards by which to address concerns that would  arise from these big cable companies' threats to a free and open  internet.  Again, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership-- persistent both in the House and the Senate--in stressing how important  this is.  As my colleagues know, these issues are going to be very important in  the future, not just with regard to privacy, which the Senator has also  been a leader on--and I very much appreciate that the hometown  newspaper wrote a glowing endorsement of the legislation he and I have  just recently introduced on privacy--but in understanding that in the  information age, you have to give consumers rights, that you have to  give them the right to privacy, and that you have to give them the  right to a free and open internet that is not controlled in speed and  that is not controlled by one's saying, If you pay us more, we will  give you access. This is going to be a key communication tool for the  21st century, and it needs to be open.  I thank my colleague for raising this important issue, and I will  continue to work with him and our other colleagues to make it the law  of the land.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. WICKER": " Mr. WICKER. Madam President, the Senator, my good friend from Utah,  has asked unanimous consent that we pass the version of the bill I  authored. Ordinarily, I would very much appreciate that. The problem  with his request is that in this Congress, it prevents us from acting  today to get to this ZTE and Huawei problem. We have a solution, and we  need to get started on it.  Let me also make the point that some things are worth paying for, and  protecting Americans, protecting our electronic system, our broadband  communications from the Chinese-owned Huawei and ZTE is worth paying  for.  What my unanimous consent request would have done, had the Senator  not objected, is we would have passed the bill and leave the issue of  how we fund it to another day. Perhaps the appropriators would have  decided to appropriate money for it. Had they done so, they would have  operated within the budget caps, as the Appropriations Committee has  done, and found room, found some offsets, and paid for it that way.  The proposal I made, that was objected to by my friend from Utah,  would also have left open the possibility of having a pay-for by the  sale of some spectrum.  I regret that the Senator is objecting based on how we will pay for  this very needed expenditure down the road. So I am compelled to object  to my good friend's unanimous consent request.    ", "Mr. SASSE": " Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, farmers and ranchers are in a tough spot.  There are a lot of families who are on the edge of bankruptcy in my  State and in ag country more broadly. As we get closer to Christmas and  to the new year without having a trade deal with Canada and Mexico, the  situation is getting bleaker.  Let's be blunt about this. By needlessly stonewalling the USMCA trade  agreement, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats are taking  Nebraska's agriculture hostage. This is petty, stupid politics at its  worst.  The USMCA trade deal is a free-trade win for our farmers and  ranchers, and they desperately need this win right now. With hard work  and grit, Nebraskans have cultivated one of the most powerful  agricultural economies in the history of the world. We literally feed  the world, and we do it with free trade because we grow so much more  food than we could ever consume. We need export markets, and lots of  people around the world want to be consuming our ag products.  It is pretty simple: Trade with Canada and Mexico is a win-win-win.  In 2018, Mexico and Canada bought more than $40 billion worth of  American agricultural products. The U.S. International Trade Commission  expects the USMCA to increase that trade by more than $33 billion. The  USMCA trade deal is designed to reinforce those partnerships in ways  that make sense for an economy that has changed a lot since NAFTA was  passed in the 1990s.  In the 1990s, ``Seinfeld'' was still on TV; we still watched movies  on VHS tape; and we took our pictures with these things of which the  pages probably don't know--cameras that had film. I will be honest. At  my house, we still watch ``Seinfeld,'' but we have happily moved on  from VHS tapes. My teenage daughters set us up on Hulu streaming, but I  can't make the remote work.  Over the last 20 years, we have seen a massive digital revolutionary  change in nearly every sector of our economy. Farmers are using new  tech to increase our productivity and to get more out of the most  fertile land on God's green Earth than people have ever assumed  possible. The USMCA trade deal makes that kind of basic improvement in  our trading relationships with our neighbors, and we need that in this  rapidly changing, evolving, and developing economy. For example, it  scraps the old rules about importing cars that still have cassette tape  players. Chuck Grassley, apparently, still has a car that has a  cassette tape player, but he is proud of it, so we won't make fun of  him here.  Passing the USMCA would secure long-term stability in our trade  agreements with our partners across North America, and it would also  send a signal to other potential partners around the world that the  United States is open for business. We need to bring Japan, the  European Union, and others to the negotiating table, and passing the  USMCA would strengthen our position significantly in setting up those  trade agreements. Time is running out.  If we don't pass the USMCA this year, we are going to send a very  different signal to our potential partners. If Speaker Pelosi and the  House Democrats can't get their act together on the USMCA, they will be  telling the whole world that we may or may not be open for business--it  all depends on short-term political posturing. That is the message they  are sending now, and that is the message that might be cemented if this  calendar year ends without our passing the USMCA. Try running a  convenience store like that, and you will be out of business in a  month.  A lot of folks in San Francisco and New York City may not think much  about beans and corn prices, but every farmer and rancher in Nebraska  is beyond baffled that this no-brainer trade deal hasn't been passed  yet. It is simply in the best long-term interests of everyone involved  in this conversation. This is not something that should be slipping  beyond this year; this is something that should pass now. We should  call the vote on Christmas morning if that is what it takes. The  Congress should not be leaving DC without passing the USMCA.  Time is running out, and we don't want to let our farmers and  ranchers face 2020 with the uncertainty and the confusion they now  feel. These Nebraskans want to do business; they want to trade; and we  want to win.  Congress is the place where Americans deliberate about the long-term  challenges we need to face for the future of our country, but instead  of deliberation, right now what they see when they turn on their TVs or  pick up their newspapers is just vicious partisanship and short-term  posturing. The American people deserve better than this.  The clown show in the House of Representatives shouldn't bring  everything to a grinding halt. It shouldn't stop us from doing right  for farmers and ranchers. The USMCA trade agreement would pass by large  majorities if introduced on the House floor, and I speculate that it  would get between 85 and 90 votes on this floor. Obviously, we can't  take it up until the House votes. The House would pass it with a big  majority. That means only Nancy Pelosi stands in the way of USMCA's  certainty for the world's greatest producers. Everyone knows this, and  Speaker Pelosi should be scheduling the vote.  We have only 28 days left in 2019, but that is plenty of time to vote  on the USMCA. That is plenty of time to get a win for our farmers and  ranchers.  Speaker Pelosi, please schedule the vote.

James Kemp McLaughlin, who passed away this week after living an impressive 101 years full of honor, [[<a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7153\">Page S7153</a>]] integrity, and service to his Nation, State, and county. General McLaughlin was the epitome of what it means to be a member of the greatest generation. He worked hard, served his country, raised a family, and gave back to society more than he could have ever received in return. Born in Braxton County, WV, in 1918, Kemp, as his family and friends called him, was raised during the Great Depression, and like many others of his generation, he learned the value of a day's work, to be thankful for what you have, and most importantly, how to survive in the face of adversity. After high school, he traveled to Morgantown to attend college at West Virginia University, where his interest in military service and aviation were first piqued when the Army Air Corps testing team visited the school's campus. A year later, he enlisted in the U.S. Army at the age of 21. A year into his enlistment, the Japanese attacked the U.S. Naval Base at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, HI, on December 7, 1941. It was not only ``a date which will live in infamy,'' as President Roosevelt so memorably declared, but it was also Kemp's 23rd birthday. Soon after, he was deployed to England as a copilot and second lieutenant in the Mighty Eight's 92nd Bombardment Group, flying the B-17 bomber. The unit's mission was to carry out strategic bombing campaigns in France and Germany during World War II. During his first mission in France, his aircraft took multiple direct hits. McLaughlin returned fire, engaged in air-to-air combat, and eventually took down the enemy. This, in addition to his 38 other combat missions during World War II, were some of the most pivotal air raids in our country's military history. The successful mission he took part in to bomb facilities in Norway is credited with halting Germany's efforts to produce an atomic bomb and potentially saved millions of lives. Upon returning to the United States in 1945, McLaughlin was recognized with numerous medals and awards, including the Distinguished Flying Cross with three clusters, the Air Corps Air Medal with eight clusters, the French Croix de Guerre, and a Presidential unit citation. He then accepted a commission as a lieutenant colonel before initially retiring in 1946, a retirement that would last 1 year, when he was asked to serve as the first commander of the West Virginia Air National Guard squadron. After the unit's service in the Korean war, he was promoted to full colonel and appointed as West Virginia's assistant adjutant general. McLaughlin was then promoted again in 1962 to brigadier general and continued to serve in leadership positions with the Air Guard until his retirement in 1977. In addition to serving his Nation in uniform, Kemp also served his community as a Kanawha County Commissioner from 1962 to 1968 and then again from 1974 to 1976, when he was appointed to serve in the West Virginia House of Delegates. Even after he retired from both his military and public life, Kemp continued to give back to his community and the Air Guard. In recognition of his contributions to the West Virginia Air National Guard, the Charleston base was fittingly renamed McLaughlin Air National Guard Base during a ceremony I was honored to attend in January 2014. In West Virginia, we are extremely proud of our military heroes, of which we have many. However, very few have had the impact on our State's military institutions and their reputation across the country as Brig. Gen. James Kemp McLaughlin. I am honored to have known him, West Virginia is fortunate to call him one of our own, and our Nation is forever thankful for his honorable service. Together, we grieve the loss of one of our greatest.<bullet>   ", "Mr. SHELBY": " Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of  consideration of the message to accompany ', H.R. 1865, ', and I ask for the  yeas and nays.    ", "Mr. COONS": " Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee,  as a member of the Bar Association of Delaware, and a Member of the  U.S. Senate. I am concerned about the transformation of our Federal  judiciary under this current administration. I am particularly  concerned about rising issues around qualification and competency. Let  me speak to that, if I might, for a few minutes.  This Senate is doing precious little in terms of legislating, but we  are moving at a breakneck pace to confirm President Trump's judicial  nominees--roughly, 150 so far. During the entire 8 years of the  previous administration, 55 circuit court judges were confirmed. Nearly  that same number have been confirmed in just 3 years of the Trump  administration--48. Nearly one in seven of all U.S. district court  judges currently serving have been appointed by President Trump.  I am deeply concerned about the quality of some of these nominations.  Some have never taken a deposition, argued a motion, let alone tried a  case in court. The American Bar Association, the professional  association of lawyers, has ranked nine of President Trump's nominees  as ``not qualified,'' which is an exceptionally unusual and striking  step for them to take.  This isn't about whether the President's nominees are conservative or  not. I understand that elections have consequences and that a  Republican President will more often than not nominate conservative  judges. I have, in some cases, joined my Democratic colleagues in  supporting qualified nominees put forward by the administration who  have won support from their home State Senators and advanced through a  bipartisan judicial nomination and confirmation process in our  committee, but let's be clear. I will not stand by while this  administration rams through nominees who are not just Republican and  not just conservative but demonstrably unqualified.  I can't support nominees with deeply concerning records about their  commitment to justice and to advancing a commonsense juris prudence. I  am not going to set a standard any lower than what has been required in  previous administrations to serve on the Federal bench for many, many  years.  We have heard in this Chamber and around this country that the  quality of the Federal bench and the capabilities and the experience  and the values and the judgment of those who serve on Federal benches  across this country is an absolutely essential piece of our  Constitution and our ordered liberty. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S6876\">Page S6876</a>, ] The cases that come before Federal courts are too important to tolerate  incompetence, inexperience, or bias in the Federal judiciary.  Why does this matter both in terms of the process and the substance?  The President has put forward nominees who, in my view, would take us  backward on civil rights and voting rights, on women's access to  healthcare, on laws that protect consumers and workers, and on the  environment. Their decisions impact every American. Equally concerning  is that Trump's nominees don't reflect the diversity of our Nation. We  want litigants to go into a court and be able to have their day in  court and be confident that the judge before them represents the  breadth and range of America.  So far, of the 55 circuit court nominees confirmed, only 11 have been  women, and they have been even less racially diverse. Of all of  President Trump's nominees, 87 percent are White and 78 percent are  men. I think the judiciary should reflect the diversity of the American  people and have strong records and a wealth of experience. Sadly, that  is not the case for several we have considered, and let me briefly  speak to two.  President Trump's nominee to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of  Appeals, who was recently confirmed, Lawrence VanDyke, raised serious  concerns about his work ethic and his temperament. He was rated ``not  qualified'' by the ABA based on concerns about his lack of knowledge of  basic procedural rules and his commitment to being truthful. Six  retired justices of the Montana Supreme Court questioned his fitness  when he ran for the Supreme Court in Montana and expressed concerns  about his partisanship and the possibility of corporate influence. He  is opposed to basic civil rights and civil liberties for the LGBTQ  community and made a range of statements that I think would be  disqualifying under any circumstance.  Sarah Pitlyk, who this Senate just confirmed this week to a lifetime  seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri,  has never tried a case, either criminal or civil, has never taken a  deposition, has never examined a witness, and has never argued a motion  in Federal or State court. The ABA unanimously rated her as  ``unqualified'' for a lifetime seat in the Federal judiciary.  We can and we should do better than this. Of the entire bar of the  State of Missouri, I am certain there are qualified, capable, and  seasoned conservatives who could have been nominated for that seat in  the entire Ninth Circuit. In particular, the State for which Mr.  VanDyke was nominated, there are certainly abundant opportunities to  choose qualified nominees. We can and we should do better than this.  In my State of Delaware, my senior Senator, Tom Carper, and I worked  together to help form a bipartisan judicial nominating committee to  fill two vacancies on our district court. We felt strongly we had to  reach out to the White House and work with them to identify consensus  nominees who would be the best candidates we could best support and  whom the President could nominate. Ultimately, we had a very productive  process, and the President nominated Maryellen Noreika and Colm  Connolly, whom we both returned positive blue slips for. They  ultimately have been confirmed by this Senate, seated, and now serve in  our district court. This is how the process should work.  We should be able to consult back and forth between the executive and  legislative until we find competent, capable, and qualified judges of  whom we can all be proud of. The Senate should not be a rubberstamp for  this administration, regardless of the quality of nominees that get  sent forward.  I will continue to oppose President Trump's nominees who are  undeserving of a seat on the Federal bench and unqualified to serve. It  is, in my view, our responsibility to guard against the politicization  of the Federal judiciary, and we should work together, not to tear down  and destroy the traditions and rules of this Senate but to find ways to  strengthen and sustain them. That is how we will move qualified and  consensus nominees forward and protect the independent judiciary on  which our very democracy rests.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    ", "Ms. SINEMA": " Ms. SINEMA. Madam President, I rise today to address one of the  biggest concerns facing everyday families in Arizona: making healthcare  more affordable and maintaining critical healthcare protections.  Sometimes the issues discussed on the Senate floor appear far removed  from the concerns of everyday Americans, but not today. Today's debate  focuses the Senate's attention on the most important issue for many  Arizonans and offers elected officials the opportunity to reject  partisan political games in favor of commonsense solutions. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S6225\">Page S6225</a>, ]  Not long ago, insurance companies were allowed to deny care or  overcharge Americans based on the fact that those Americans had been  sick before or had been born with a chronic condition.  Arizonans who had been previously treated for skin cancer or diabetes  were told that no insurance company would cover them or that the  insurance plans they purchased would not cover their preexisting  conditions, despite promises of comprehensive coverage. Beyond major  illnesses, Arizonans with even common conditions, such as high blood  pressure, high cholesterol, asthma, and even acne, were denied the  coverage they needed. Until recently, insurance companies had also been  allowed to charge consumers high prices for insurance plans only to  leave out coverage for essential health benefits that virtually all  Americans eventually need, such as prescription drug costs, ambulance  costs, and hospital stays--critical needs that consumers rightly expect  will be covered.  Insurance is supposed to be there when people need it. Hard-working  Americans who play by the rules and pay their monthly premiums  shouldn't have the rug pulled out from under them at the very moment  they need healthcare. That is why such discrimination against people  with preexisting health conditions is now banned and why health  insurance plans are now required to cover essential health benefits.  That is why it is so disturbing that the administration and some  Members of Congress have begun moving backward, allowing insurance  companies to again sell plans to Americans that lack the very health  protections consumers need.  Congress has a lot of work to do to make healthcare affordable and  protect access for American families and businesses, from lowering  premiums to stopping surprise medical billing, but partisan approaches  will not solve these challenges. We can and must work across the aisle  to pass bipartisan solutions, such as increasing the number of doctors  to address provider shortages, lowering costs for home health services,  expanding mental healthcare, and eliminating the health insurance tax.  I have partnered with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  sponsor legislation that achieves these goals, but allowing insurance  companies to return to their old practices will only hurt everyday  Arizona families. These health plans lack key protections. They are  often called junk plans and for good reason. Junk plans mislead  Arizonans--selling something billed as health insurance when, in fact,  it is better described as a bill of goods. When Arizonans who are sold  these plans need to actually use the coverage they paid for, the rug  gets pulled out from under them yet again.  I hear from hard-working Arizonans on a daily basis who deserve  access to critical health protections; Arizonans like Chantal, who has  a preexisting autoimmune disease that without treatment would cause her  to become blind; Arizonans like Corrine from Phoenix, whose daughter  was born with a congenital heart condition--before the law protected  people with preexisting conditions, Corrine's family was unable to find  an insurer who would cover their family--and Arizonans like John from  Casa Grande, who signed up for a plan that he was told covered  preexisting conditions only to find out after he paid his first month's  premium, that his particular preexisting condition wouldn't qualify for  coverage.  There are 2.8 million Arizonans under the age of 65 just like  Chantal, Corrine, and John who live with preexisting health conditions.  That is half of all nonelderly Arizonans whose healthcare is at risk.  These Arizonans remind us exactly what is at stake and exactly what is  wrong with partisan politics in Washington today. For too long, too  many elected officials here have focused on how they can score  political points to help them win the next election, all at the expense  of the health and security of everyday families.  Arizonans are rightly worried that the dysfunction and chaos they see  coming from Washington could threaten their family's coverage, and that  is unacceptable.  It is time to get partisan politics out of Arizonans' healthcare. I  call on both parties to quit the partisan games, come together, and  stop the sale of junk plans that fail to protect people with  preexisting conditions. We must protect access to healthcare for these  millions of Arizonans and tens of millions of Americans, and we must  make healthcare more affordable for everyday families.  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on \", S.J. Res. 52, \".  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. MANCHIN": " Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask for yeas and nays.    ", "Ms. McSALLY": " Ms. McSALLY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the importance  of a vote we took earlier on the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2020.  This bill delivers on the needs of the warfighter today and invests  in capabilities we must have for the future.  I also fought for and secured huge wins for the Grand Canyon State.  As home to 10 military installations, Arizona plays a key role in many  missions critical to our Nation's defense. Our bipartisan legislation  highlights the incredible contributions that Arizona bases, citizens,  and industry make to support our military each and every day.  Since I have been in Congress, I led the fight to stop the A-10 from  being mothballed, and this bill continues to secure resources needed to  modernize [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7087\">Page S7087</a>, ] the A-10, based at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.  We also succeeded in funding a new hangar and barracks at Marine  Corps Air Station Yuma and additional F-35s at Luke Air Force Base and  Yuma for training and deploying the next generation of F-35 pilots.  I also secured funding to upgrade the Barry Goldwater training ranges  and many other Arizona initiatives.  The annual defense bill is about protecting the people who protect  us. This year's bill reiterates to the men and women of our military  that we have their backs. It provides the highest pay raise in a decade  and protects military families from greedy contractors who provide  their tenants dangerous and unlivable base housing. These contractors,  who act more like slumlords than landlords, will now be required to  implement a tenant bill of rights.  We also give military families more power in filing disputes and fund  additional housing office personnel to ensure families have advocates  on base.  I am particularly pleased to see 17 of my 18 reforms to combat sexual  assault in the military are also included in this bill. Earlier this  year, I disclosed that I, too, am a survivor of military sexual  assault. After I did, I charged the top leaders at the Pentagon to  immediately identify ways to improve the investigation process and  support to victims.  My provisions increased the number of personnel investigating sexual  assault cases and ensure a victim has access to a special victims'  counsel within 72 hours of reporting an assault. These and my other  improvements share the goal of getting justice for victims sooner.  The greatest disappointment in an otherwise bipartisan bill is the  lack of backfill funding for military construction projects.  After unprecedented obstruction by Democrats on border security  funding, some resources were diverted to border security projects under  authorities legally granted to the President by Congress.  I hear from my constituents all the time in our pro-military and  southern border State: We can and must secure our border and fund our  military. Life is full of difficult choices. This shouldn't be one of  them for any Member on either side of the aisle.  The Senate voted in a landslide, bipartisan way, 86 to 8, to fund  effective military construction projects in this bill--in the Senate  version of this bill. Then, during conference negotiations, Democrats  refused to fully fund these projects due to political games surrounding  border security.  Think about that for a minute. They didn't like the President  diverting the resources to secure our border, so they decided to take  it out on our military by refusing to backfill funding.  Our military deserves better. The American people deserve better.  Nevertheless, one of Arizona's fiscal year 2019 projects at Fort  Huachuca was stalled for unforeseen environmental issues at the  construction site, so it wasn't ready to spend the fiscal year 2019  funds that we approved for it. This funding would have been diverted to  some other purpose in any other year. It could have been funded in  fiscal year 2020, but the Democrats refused to support that. The  earliest the project will be ready to start is next summer.  The Secretary of the Army has assured me that this project will be in  the budget for fiscal year 2021, which starts 9\\\\1/2\\\\ months from now,  following the completion of this environmental cleanup. I will continue  to fight for the funding for Fort Huachuca and resolve to work hand-in- hand with the Army until this project is complete.  Finally, I have to note that this is the first NDAA that this body  has passed in decades without Senator John McCain. I think I speak for  Members of the Armed Services Committee and this entire Senate when I  say that we have felt his absence deeply this past year. While he may  not have been physically with us, it still has the fingerprints of his  leadership, grit, and ultimate dedication to servicemembers and  military families.  His memory has propelled us to secure lasting, meaningful reforms for  the men and women who serve, whether in uniform, as a family member, or  in a supporting civilian role.  This is the 59th consecutive annual defense bill that has been  passed. It remains a shining example, for the most part, of what we can  accomplish when we work together to protect Americans and support our  troops.  It was my privilege to bring home these massive wins, working with my  colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, for our troops and for the  great State of Arizona.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. SCOTT of Florida": " Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, Judge Anuraag Singhal has  honorably served the State of Florida for several years, and I proudly  support his confirmation as a district judge for the Southern District  of Florida today. He has built a distinguished legal career, serving as  a criminal prosecutor for Florida's Seventeenth Judicial Circuit and  later opening a private practice focused on criminal defense and  appellate work. Throughout his career, he has demonstrated a firm  commitment to the rule of law, and as Governor of Florida, I had the  distinct honor to appoint Judge Singhal to Florida's Seventeenth  Judicial Circuit court in 2011. I am equally honored to support his  confirmation to the United States District Court for the Southern  District of Florida today and know he will continue to serve our State  and Nation well.    ", "Ms. ROSEN": " Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I stand here today in opposition to the  nomination of Lawrence VanDyke to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in  Nevada, and I stand here today because I think we can all agree--no  matter where you are from--that Federal judges in our States should  come from our communities, and they should reflect our communities.  It is unfortunate to see this Chamber disregard Nevada's voice and  move forward with Mr. VanDyke's nomination. The State of Nevada has  numerous qualified lawyers and judges who have done good work and have  good reputations in our communities, who are nonpartisan, and who would  make excellent additions to the Ninth Circuit. But the White House  didn't nominate any of these qualified individuals for the Ninth  Circuit. Instead, the President nominated Lawrence VanDyke, a man who  wasn't born in Nevada, didn't grow up in Nevada, didn't go to school in  Nevada, and doesn't live in Nevada now. He hasn't even set foot in  Nevada for over a year.  This administration has nominated someone to serve on the Nevada seat  of the Ninth Circuit who--and let me be clear--is not a Nevadan. Mr.  VanDyke is, however, a Washington, DC, lawyer and failed political  candidate from Montana who was nominated to further his and this  administration's extreme political views.  His nomination is being imposed on the people of Nevada, despite the  many qualified individuals in our own State--individuals who are  respected on both sides of the aisle.  As if Mr. VanDyke's lack of any meaningful connection to the State of  Nevada wasn't enough, Mr. VanDyke is not even qualified to hold this  post, according to the American Bar Association. In reviewing this  nominee and speaking with dozens upon dozens of his former colleagues,  the ABA found Mr. VanDyke specifically ``not qualified'' to serve in  this role. The ABA has made that finding for only 3 percent of  President Trump's judicial nominees, and Mr. VanDyke is the first in a  small group whose nomination will move forward without--let me repeat:  without--the support of either Senator representing the State where he  will sit on the bench if confirmed. That we would allow someone who is  not qualified to hold a lifetime position in such a critically  important role is, frankly, absurd, and it is something no Senator  should support, no matter the party of the President who nominated  them.  The ABA's report found Mr. VanDyke to be lacking in knowledge of day- to-day practice, including procedural rules. The report found Mr.  VanDyke to be lacking humility and an open [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S6920\">Page S6920</a>, ] mind, and the ABA's report found Mr. VanDyke to be lacking a commitment  to the truth.  In order to see how the ABA came to this conclusion, one only needs  to look at Mr. VanDyke's record of pursuing an ideological agenda  instead of working for the people and defending the law. In his past  role as attorney general of Montana, he filed many politically driven  briefs, including one asking the Supreme Court to strike down Roe v.  Wade altogether, a view that is out of step with the views of Nevadans.  He even signed the State onto one brief without reading it, by his own  admission.  Mr. VanDyke has also made controversial and appalling statements  about LGBTQ Americans, writing this: ``[There is] ample reason for  concern that same-sex marriage will hurt families, and consequentially  children and society.''  Mr. VanDyke was given every opportunity to disavow this statement and  repeatedly declined to do so. Allowing Mr. VanDyke to serve on the  Ninth Circuit would put at risk the rights of thousands of LGBTQ  Americans to employment, healthcare, housing, and basic equal treatment  in what is often the court of last resort.  Surely you must agree, no matter who is President or who controls the  Senate, you would want qualified judges with connections to the State  who will be fair to your constituents and not use cases to advance  their personal ideological agenda.  I oppose the nomination of Mr. VanDyke, and if it is withdrawn or  voted down, I will be ready at a moment's notice to work with this  White House in finding a fair, qualified, and nonpartisan nominee from  Nevada. The people of my home State and yours deserve nothing less.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. PERDUE": " Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.

Mr. President, I congratulate my friend and the senior  Senator from Vermont, Patrick Leahy, for casting his 16,000th vote in  the U.S. Senate. Since he was first elected in 1974, Senator Leahy has  worked tirelessly for the people of Vermont, bringing to Washington,  DC, Vermont values: a belief in justice, civic engagement, and the  importance of community. Senator Leahy has long been a champion of  human rights, a steward of the environment, and his efforts have  brought important Federal resources to our State. I join with his wife  Marcelle, his children and grandchildren, and Vermonters throughout our  State in congratulating him on this milestone vote and thanking him for  his 44 years of dedicated service. I look forward to continuing to work  together to represent the people of Vermont.    ", "Mr. ROBERTS": " Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I am honored to pay tribute to Johnny  Isakson. I don't know how I could top anything that has been mentioned  by Senator Perdue and, especially, Senator Coons--Senator Chris Coons  has given us a charge to follow Johnny's example--and Senator Grassley  and now Senator Murray and everybody who will follow me.  I have a problem. I did all of this on Veterans Day. I tried to point  out that his committee has passed 57 bills. I don't know of any other  committee that has done that on behalf of the people who wear the  uniform of the United States--who do so much on our behalf--and, more  especially, for the VA and what that is all about. There has never been  a better chairman than Johnny Isakson. I said all of that. I also said,  in this body, there are those who choose ideology and partisan issues  while Johnny is someone who works with his colleagues to pass  legislation that benefits not only our Nation's veterans but every  American's pocketbook and daily life.  The reason I just sort of read through that is that we have just had  lunch wherein nearly every Senator was in attendance with the exception  of those who are running for President, and they would have liked to  have been there. By my count, there were seven standing ovations-- seven. Each Member, both of the leaders, and the people who have served  with Johnny either as a minority member or as a chairman gave their  amazing tributes to this wonderful man.  Isn't it amazing that in this very difficult time in the Senate, when  the bar of civility is about forehead high--you don't want to run into  it here--that here is a man who has given us a way out? I have never  seen that before.  Johnny has had, I think, 50 years of public service. I have him beat  if you add in staff time and 40 years of public service--by the way, of  being elected 24 to 0. I have never seen such an outpouring of  affection and genuine admiration for an individual, be he a Member of  the House or the Senate, as was experienced at this lunch.  It was Chris Coons who, during his tribute, said: Why don't we use  this as a wonderful way to see if we can get past all of the trials and  tribulations that we have gone through in the Senate and work together  for a change? People talked about, when they had come to the Senate,  that it wasn't this way. Actually, it was. Yet we look very fondly upon  the past. So I hope that people can take Chris's challenge to heart.  It is a pretty easy deal. Johnny knows it by heart, for that is who  he is; yet, if a person or a group of people or Senators in this body  love to come down here and make speech after speech--in many cases,  they are very partisan, and many of the younger Members do this--I give  them that. I mean, that is their right. I remember, in the early days  when I was in the House, that I did that a couple of times and then was  talked to by some of the senior Members who said: We don't do that here  in order to get along, especially in the all-powerful House Agriculture  Committee and now the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry  Committee. We always work together because we are nonpartisan on that  committee.  So you ignore that. Then, if you really do take the time to know that  individual, as opposed to the individual you have seen on the floor,  you will find out this is a person who is very interesting. You will  find out this is a person worth knowing. You will find out that you  have common ground. You will find out that you can get a vote for them  in order for them to vote for the farm bill or for a veterans' program  or for any other thing.  So I think that is the example that Johnny has set. I don't know if  there is anything more I can add after seven standing ovations and  obviously many, many people actually telling the truth about you. I  know, Johnny, it must be a little much for you. Frankly, I am getting a  little tired of it.  I would just like to say what I said back then when I was speaking of  your tremendous success as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee  when I said: ``Johnny, thank you for your service; now thank you for  your message; now thank you for being simply who you are.'' And I said:  ``Senators eventually come and Senators go.''  I do not think we will see the likes of Senator Johnny Isakson for  years to come. We love you. I love you. I will miss you greatly. Thank  you for your fortitude and courage in fighting Parkinson's as an  example to so many.  Semper fi, my dear friend.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. PAUL": " Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, we have before us today the National Defense  Authorization Act to authorize the programs and policies of the  Department of Defense. We will be taking a vote to finalize this bill  shortly.  Our national defense is incredibly important. It is mandated in the  Constitution. Our national defense is arguably Congress's primary  constitutional responsibility.  I have great respect and honor for those in uniform who serve. In  fact, I recently introduced a bill to give each soldier who served in  the War on Terror a $2,500 bonus and, at the same time, officially end  the war in Afghanistan. Ending the Afghan war would save us about $50  billion a year.  Unfortunately, the bill before us does not end any of our multitude  of wars. The bill before us simply continues the status quo and throws  more money around the world at conflicts we can't even begin to fathom.  Before rubberstamping more money, it is worth a moment for us to take  a step back and consider two things. First, we need to ask ourselves  whether borrowing millions of dollars year after year to fuel our  appetite for more military spending is a wise policy in the years  ahead.  Second, we need to look at how this bill has been loaded up to carry  things only somewhat related or not related at all to national defense.  As I have reminded my colleagues often, Admiral Mullen, the former  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the national debt was  our greatest national security threat. His exact wording was ``the most  significant threat to our national security is our debt.'' That was in  2010.  When he made that remark, our debt was only $13 trillion. Our debt is  now over $23 trillion. We just keep borrowing and borrowing, and there  is no end in sight.  Under the new budget deal passed by Republicans and Democrats, we are  borrowing $2.75 billion every day. In fact, we are borrowing nearly $2  million every minute.  We spend more on our military than the next seven largest militaries  combined. Our Defense Department is so large that it took them a decade  to even figure out how to audit themselves. Then they said that the  audit itself would cost over half a billion dollars. But then, last  year, they arrived back at square one. After all that effort, they  said: Well, we just can't figure it out. It is too big. We can't audit  the Army, the Navy, the Marines, or the Air Force.  We spend so much money that the Department of Defense literally can't  keep track of all of it. We don't have a great idea of exactly how much  we are wasting because no one can get a grip on how much is being  spent.  A few years ago, the Defense Business Board, which is a defense  advisory panel of corporate executives who report to the Secretary of  Defense, recommended that the Department of Defense can save $125  billion in administrative expenses.  According to news accounts, that report scared everyone at the  Pentagon, so they buried the report. They even tried to keep it away  from Congress for fear that Congress might actually do something with  it, although I wouldn't be holding my breath or too worried. I am not  familiar with Congress ever cutting anything.  We are set to spend $738 billion on the military this year. That is  up $22 billion from last year. Over the past 6 years, military spending  has risen over $120 billion. We say that we are for accountability,  efficiency, and savings. Yet we keep piling good money after bad. How  can we demand better accounting and efficiency when we budget increases  every year?  To be clear, I support our national defense. Supporting our  servicemembers is a worthy cause. There are things in this bill that I  do support. I am a cosponsor of the bill to eliminate the so-called  widow's tax, and I have argued that it is the right thing to do. We  should find the money to pay for it. That is in this bill.  I support returning the 101st Airborne at Fort Campbell to its full  air assault capacity with the return of a combat aviation brigade. That  is in this bill.  I support giving our servicemembers a pay increase. That is in the  bill. But I take issue when Congress adds other things to this bill  that don't have anything to do with our military.  This bill would sanction NATO allies and potentially American energy  companies if they have any involvement with Nord Stream 2 pipeline.  This is a pipeline between Russia and Germany. The pipeline is  basically done. It may well be completed in the next few months. The  pipeline will be completed. Yet we want to jeopardize our relationship  with our allies and with businesses both in Europe and America.  This bill would also drop more sanctions into the middle of the  Syrian civil war, as well as funding for so-called ``vetted'' Syrian  rebel groups. All this would do is prolong the Syrian civil war and,  with it, the humanitarian suffering and displacement we have seen in  the region. The Syrian civil war is largely over. I agree with  President Trump that it is time to come home.  Another problem with our insatiable appetite for more military  spending is that it requires conservatives to make bad compromises. If  you want $40 billion in new defense spending, then you have to give the  liberals $40 billion new domestic spending. If anything, that is the  real nature of today's bipartisanship: You can have your money as long  as we get our money.  The dirty little secret in Washington is that there is actually too  much compromise. Republicans want more military spending; Democrats  want more welfare money. And with each new Congress, Congress always  chooses to spend and borrow more money.  For example, this bill provides a new mandatory benefit program: paid  parental leave for all Federal employees, starting next year. The  program will cost over $3 billion forever--and most of these programs  continue to expand forever. The program will cost $3 billion a year,  and, of course, there is nothing in the bill that tells how we are  going to pay for it. So we are going to have paid leave, everybody, but  we are going to borrow the money from China to give this great benefit.  In essence, today, Congress is simply saying: Add it to my tab; the  deficit be damned. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, this  represents a better benefit than many working Americans enjoy, and it  has nothing to do with national defense.  Conservatism is more than supporting military spending at any cost.  We have to do more and make tough decisions that enable a strong  national defense and a balanced budget.  Many so-called conservatives will hail this bloated military  spending, but, in truth, there is nothing fiscally conservative about  borrowing money from China to pay for our military. In fact, I would  argue that borrowing money to buy more tanks or planes or to police the  far corners of the Earth actually damages our national security.  Some have argued that our military is hollowed out, exhausted from so  many far-flung conflicts--probably true. They will argue that we must  expand military spending to meet the mission.  Perhaps we should entertain the opposite argument. Perhaps it is not  that our military budget is too small but [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7065\">Page S7065</a>, ] that our military mission is too large. I, for one, hope for a day when  Congress rediscovers that our constitutional mandate is to defend  America first and only to become involved in war as a last resort and,  even then, America should only become involved in war when Congress has  debated and done its constitutional duty to declare war.  Until that day, I will continue to argue that the only fiscally  conservative, fiscally responsible action is to vote against expanding  the military budget. I encourage my fellow Senators to consider that.  I yield back.    ", "Mr. HAWLEY": " Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, just two brief points this evening--the  first is that I am proud to join not only as a supporter of this  measure but as original cosponsor, and I want to thank the other  Senators--Senator Rubio, especially Senator Cardin, and Senator Risch-- for their leadership on this issue, but I want to be clear that we are  here today in this Chamber, and what we are doing is possible tonight  because of the bravery and the courage of the protesters in Hong Kong.  Many of them are very young people who are risking their very lives,  taking to the streets, standing for democracy, standing for the  promises that were made to them by Beijing many years ago and fighting  for them now, putting everything on the line. And I just want to say to  those protesters that you are making a difference, that your lives have  made a difference, and to those who even now are trapped inside PolyU  in this siege that the Hong Kong police force has created--this  humanitarian crisis that the Hong Kong police force has fostered--what  you are doing is inspiring the world. What you are doing has moved this  body. What you are doing is changing the world. Thank you for your  courage. Thank you for your bravery. Thank you for believing in your  city, and thank you for believing in Hong Kong.  The other thing I would say is that, while today is a good day in the  struggle to preserve the freedoms of this city and the struggle against  a totalitarian regime in Beijing, it is not the last day. Although this  step is an important step that this Chamber takes, it is not the last  step that this Nation may need to take in order to hold China to its  commitments made in 1984, in order to protect the autonomy and the  liberty of the city of Hong Kong because, make no mistake, we are in  for a long struggle with Communist China. We are in for a long struggle  with Beijing. We know what their ambitions are: to dominate Hong Kong,  to dominate Taiwan, to dominate the region and, ultimately, to impose  their will on the entire international system. We are going to have to  stand against that for freedom, for liberty, for our security and our  prosperity.  So there is much to do. There is a long road ahead of us, but today  is a good day, and I hope the people of Hong Kong will see that the  people of the free world are awake, that they are with you, and we are  ready to stand together.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of Judge Stephanie  Dawkins Davis for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of  Michigan.  I had the honor of introducing Judge Dawkins Davis at the Senate  Judiciary Committee hearing more than 6 months ago. As I told the  members of the committee, Judge Dawkins Davis is a highly respected  member of the Michigan legal community, and she will serve our State  well as a district court judge.  Judge Dawkins Davis has been an exemplary public servant who has  worked hard and honorably to serve the people of Michigan. She has  earned the respect of colleagues across the State and has garnered  numerous awards throughout her career.  She began her career as a civil defense attorney at Dickinson Wright  and later joined the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern  District of Michigan, prosecuting cases at both the trial and appellate  levels. She also spent time as a deputy unit chief of the Controlled  Substances Unit and as a high intensity drug trafficking area liaison.  Her successful work led to her appointment as executive assistant  U.S. attorney, and after that, she became a magistrate judge for the  Eastern District and was selected to serve at the Flint Federal  courthouse.  Judge Dawkins Davis is a qualified jurist. The American Bar  Association unanimously rated her as ``well qualified.'' She was also  the first African-American woman nominated by President Trump for a  Federal judgeship.  I am proud to recognize Judge Dawkins Davis for her many  accomplishments and for the diverse voice and perspective she will  bring to the bench.  This seat has been vacant since October 26, 2016; that is more than 3  years. It is past time that the Senate consider Judge Dawkins Davis's  nomination, and I am glad it is finally happening today.

With Johnny's retirement, the Senate is losing a truly great leader;  a man of courage, whose dedication to this country has inspired me more  times than I can count; a man of honor, who has worked tirelessly for  the veteran community; and a man of compassion, who I am so grateful to  be able to call a dear friend.  We will never be able to fully thank Johnny for all he has done for  the rest of us, but today, I want to try. Johnny, thank you for being  there for me at Walter Reed when I was a Wounded Warrior, just home  from combat. Thank you for being by my side last spring, a decade and a  half later, on my first trip back to Iraq.  Thank you for always being there when it matters the most, for being  such an incredible advocate for our veterans, for giving the absolute  best birthday and holiday presents, and for showing what it means to  lead a life guided by integrity, a life defined by service.

Mr. President, on the motion to invoke cloture on the  House amendment to the Senate Amendment to ', H.R. 1158, ', the Consolidated  Appropriations Act, vote No. 427, I had intended to be recorded as  voting no. [[', <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7197\">Page S7197</a>, ]  (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)    ", "Mr. BOOKER": " Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I want to express my disapproval of the  confirmation of Eugene Scalia as Secretary of Labor. America's workers  are the backbone of our economy, and the Secretary of Labor should be  entrusted to strengthen worker protections, support unions, and play a  crucial role in ensuring a just economy. Instead, Eugene Scalia has  repeatedly demonstrated that he prioritizes the well-being of corporate  interests over those of workers. Throughout his career as a corporate  lawyer, he fought against unions, worker safety regulations, and  consumer protections rules. For those reasons, I do not believe Eugene  Scalia is fit to serve as Secretary of Labor.  My grandfather was one of the first Black members of United Auto  Workers at Ford Motor Company, and through him, I learned the  importance of worker rights that collective bargaining provides.  Through collective action, unions are able to provide workers with  livable wages, safe working conditions, and access to benefits like  healthcare coverage and retirement savings. Not only has Eugene Scalia  represented companies in arbitrations against collective bargaining  agreements, but he identifies it as one of his most significant career  moments. The Secretary of Labor should be doing everything in their  power to make it easier--not harder--for working people to join unions.  Eugene Scalia also represented the Chamber of Commerce in working to  overturn the fiduciary rule, a commonsense step towards protecting the  retirement security of countless working families. Employers trying to  design a quality plan for their workers, workers starting to save, and  retirees trying to avoid spending down their nest egg too quickly  deserve access to quality advice, without fear that financial bias is [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S6088\">Page S6088</a>, ] clouding their broker's judgment. Unfortunately, that access to  quality, unbiased advice was ultimately overturned, in part thanks to  the efforts of Eugene Scalia.  More Federal oversight and stricter safeguards are necessary to  prevent the exploitation and discrimination of working people; yet  Eugene Scalia has dedicated his career to fighting against the existing  safeguards. He argued that more than 30 women alleging sexual  harassment and retaliation should have their claims thrown out,  defended a company that refused to hire a woman because she had  dreadlocks, and fought against corporate whistleblowers. He has also  worked to undermine the rights and protections provided by the  Americans with Disabilities Act, stating that workers with disabilities  should not be provided workplace accommodations.  When I go back to my home in Newark, I see many working families  struggling to make ends meet, sometimes while working two to three  jobs. They often face underemployment, wage stagnation, wage theft, and  a variety of other tactics meant to keep wages down and suppress worker  rights. They deserve a Secretary of Labor that will fight for them. The  Trump administration and the previous Secretary of Labor have been  relentless in their efforts to roll back workers' rights, attack  unions, and undermine civil liberties. Unfortunately, I do not have any  reason to believe that Secretary Scalia will be any different. This is  why I must express my deep concern and opposition to his nomination and  confirmation as Secretary of Labor.    ", "Mrs. MURKOWSKI": " Mrs. MURKOWSKI.

", "Mr. TILLIS": " Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Lt. Col. Allen Lamb, a retired Air Force pilot from the great State of North Carolina, for his many years of service to his country as a combat pilot and the important role he played in the development of U.S. Air Force tactics. Lt. Col. Allen Lamb selflessly dedicated 20 years of his life to serving his country in the United States Air Force. During his service, he saw combat during both the Korean war and Vietnam war, while piloting a variety of aircraing from propeller-driven heavy bombers to the most advanced jet fighters of the era. Lieutenant Colonel Lamb had an uncanny ability of surviving the mid-air accidents that occurred on a few of the many combat and training missions that he participated in, and he is notable for successfully ejecting from four-engine, three- engine, and two-engine airplanes at different points during his career. From protecting his B-26 bomber as a tail gunner from Soviet MIG pilots over Korea, to being distinguished as the first American pilot to successfully destroy North Vietnamese surface to air missile--SAM-- sites in an F-100 Super Sabre fighter jet, Lieutenant Colonel Lamb's Cold War service consisted of many hazardous and diverse assignments. Although it is difficult to narrow all of the spectacular and death- defying accomplishments of Lieutenant Colonel Lamb's career down to one specific achievement, his participation in the first ``Wild Weasel'' strike against a North Vietnamese SA-2 SAM site is particularly notable for the significant influence it had on future Air Force tactics. In 1965, early in the Vietnam War, the U.S. Air Force was losing a considerable number of planes during the strategic bombing campaign in North Vietnam due to the effectiveness of deadly Soviet-supplied SA-2 SAMs that were strategically scattered throughout the country. As a result, the Air Force developed a daring solution to counter the SAM threat that involved using agile F-100 Super Sabre and F-4 Phantom fighter jets to detect and suppress the missile launching sites. The innovative Air Force mission'' was soon given the name ``Wild Weasel'' because the anti-SAM mission was reminiscent of the way a hunting ferret enters the den of its prey to kill it. In late 1965, Lieutenant Colonel Lamb was given command of leading the first Wild Weasel mission, Wild Weasel I. On this mission, which took place just over 50 kilometers from the North Vietnamese capital Hanoi, Lieutenant Colonel Lamb and his navigator Jack Donovan flew extremely low on multiple strafing runs and were successful in destroying a SA-2 SAM site that was not previously known to exist. Both men were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross by the Air Force for their efforts. Lieutenant Colonel Lamb respectfully declined receiving the Silver Star award when he was offered it because his crewman Jack Donovan was not also included. Wild Weasel I demonstrated that the Wild Weasel project was an effective method of identifying and eliminating enemy SAM capabilities, and it was essential in saving the lives of American bomber pilots as they continued to conduct missions over North Vietnam until 1973. Lieutenant Colonel Lamb completed the first, second, and third Wild Weasel kills during the war, and the tactics he was instrumental in developing during the Wild Weasel missions are still utilized in modern Air Force operations to suppress enemy air defenses. As a U.S. Senator, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and a North Carolinian, I am pleased to recognize and honor Lt. Col. Allen Lamb for his impressive career of military service, his critical role in the development of U.S. Air Force tactics, and his steadfast commitment to our country.<bullet>   ", "Mr. COTTON": " Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, Stephen Carr has been described by friends  as a ``gentle giant'' and ``all-American boy.'' He enjoyed hunting and  fishing. He played on the offensive line at Southwest Baptist  University.  He came from a law enforcement family. He always knew he wanted to be  a police officer, so it was little surprise when Stephen joined the  Fayetteville Police Department 2\\\\1/2\\\\ years ago. He served with  professionalism and valor in those 2\\\\1/2\\\\ years as a patrol officer in  the Dickson Street entertainment district. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7021\">Page S7021</a>, ]  Sadly, Officer Carr was in his patrol car Saturday night when he was  ambushed by a gunman looking for an officer to kill. Carr's fellow  police heard the gunshots and responded to the scene within seconds.  With little regard for their own safety, they pursued the gunman down  an alley. When confronted, they met force with force and took him down.  The whole incident took just minutes from start to finish.  Emergency services were on the scene within an instant, but despite  their best efforts, they couldn't save Officer Carr. He succumbed to  his wounds on the scene, as did his killer. Officer Carr was only 27  years old.  This tragedy reminds us of the terrible risks officers face every day  when they put on the uniform and the badge, not knowing whether they  will be alive to take it off that night. Already this year, 118  officers across America have been killed in the line of duty. Some were  the victims of random tragedies. Others, like Officer Carr, were  targeted by a criminal class that hates what the police represent: law  and order.  Since Officer Carr's killing, two more officers have fallen in the  line of duty. Detective Joseph Seals, a 15-year veteran of the Jersey  City Police Department, was shot to death while approaching two  suspected killers. Sergeant Kaila Sullivan, a 16-year veteran of the  Nassau Bay Police Department, was struck and killed by a fleeing  suspect in a vehicle. All of these fallen officers will be remembered  as heroes.  In Arkansas, especially, we will remember Officer Carr, whose watch  ended on December 7, 2019. May he rest in peace.  Honoring Storekeeper 1st Class John William Craig  Mr. President, Navy Storekeeper 1st Class John William Craig of  Monroe, AR, perished aboard the USS Oklahoma on December 7, 1941, a  date which will live in infamy. On that day, Imperial Japanese bombers  shattered the morning calm at Pearl Harbor, killing Petty Officer Craig  and more than 2,000 of his brothers in arms.  Nearly eight decades later, however, his remains were listed as  unknown and interred at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific  in Honolulu. He was reported as missing in action, but Petty Officer  Craig is missing no more. Thanks to the outstanding work of the Defense  POW/MIA Accounting Agency, his remains were accounted for in 2017, and  just last weekend, on the 78th anniversary of the attack on Pearl  Harbor, he arrived home in Arkansas to his final resting place.  Petty Officer Craig's burial is a long-overdue moment of honor for a  brave sailor. It is also a moment of hope for our many military  families whose loved ones haven't yet been found--a reminder that our  Nation will not rest until every one of our missing heroes is back in  our arms or laid to rest with honor.  We have now fulfilled this solemn pledge to Petty Officer Craig.  Nearly 80 years after his disappearance, we have affirmed once again  that the United States leaves no man behind on the battlefield.  Fentanyl Sanctions Act  Mr. President, synthetic opioids like fentanyl kill tens of thousands  of Americans each year. They are a terrible accelerant that has fueled  the worst drug crisis in our Nation's history, killing more people  every year than died in the entire Vietnam war.  These drugs aren't made here in the United States. No, they are  flooding across our borders from overseas, trafficked by cartels, and,  even unwittingly, sometimes by the U.S. Postal Service.  Synthetic opioids are often produced in superlabs by the drug cartels  that are terrorizing our border communities. But the ingredients for  those drugs--and sometimes the drugs themselves--can be traced back to  a different source: China, whose vast pharmaceutical and chemical  industries frequently have been abused to poison our fellow citizens.  The Chinese Communist Party has been waging an opium war in reverse  against the United States for far too long. As tens of thousands of  Americans have perished from overdoses, Chinese officials have turned a  blind eye to the drug criminals who have profited off of our pain. But  now, desperate for a trade deal to save its sputtering economy, Beijing  has finally promised to crack down on fentanyl and other synthetic  opioids. But we would be naive to trust any promise from Chinese  Communists, especially this one.  It is time that we take matters into our own hands. That is exactly  what we will do in the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, which  includes my bill introduced with Senator Schumer to sanction foreign  drug dealers in China, Mexico, and elsewhere. The bill also urges the  President to work with our allies to impose even tougher multilateral  sanctions against foreign drug dealers. It authorizes new funding for  law enforcement and the intelligence community for counternarcotics  activities. It establishes a commission to find new ways to stop the  flow of drugs from overseas.  This bill will soon be signed by the President and become law. This  is welcome news for law enforcement and for families who are battling  the crisis of opioid addiction, and it is bad news for the Chinese  Communist Party and foreign drug dealers around the world who are  responsible for the poisoning of so many Americans.  Protecting Europe's Energy Security Act of 2019  Mr. President, 70 years after the creation of NATO, the biggest  external threats to the alliance are our revisionist adversaries--China  and Russia. Unfortunately, however, the alliance faces some internal  threats, too, among the allies themselves, who too often fail to take  these adversaries seriously. Instead, they strike dangerous deals with  the very powers that threaten to destroy all of us.  Consider the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project between Germany and  Russia. Germany touts the pipeline's commercial benefits, but Russia  sees it differently--as a strategic tool to divide Europe and thus to  strengthen its fictional claim to dominion over parts of Eastern  Europe.  The Nord Stream 2 pipeline would effectively double the amount of  natural gas Russia could export to Europe along a route that bypasses  the alliance's eastern frontier. This would deepen the NATO members'  reliance on Russian gas while it would enhance Putin's ability to  engage in energy blackmail, just as he has done in the past. For  example, in 2009, Russia shut off the flow of natural gas to Europe  during a dispute with Ukraine, causing energy shortages across the  entire continent in the dead of winter. Putin's opportunities for such  blackmail will only increase if Nord Stream 2 is completed because he  will be able to ship his gas to Western Europe without its transiting  Eastern Europe. Therefore, he will be able to blackmail Eastern Europe  while the Germans will sit warm and toasty in their living rooms-- indifferent to the plight of their NATO allies to the east.  This pipeline is almost complete, so the timeline for action is  short. Thankfully, the National Defense Authorization Act includes our  bill to impose mandatory sanctions on companies that are constructing,  insuring, or financing Vladimir Putin's pipeline to Europe. These  sanctions are a demonstration of our commitment to the strength and  security of the whole NATO alliance.  I urge the German Government and all companies involved in this  dangerous endeavor to pull back before it is too late and to consider  the serious consequences that Nord Stream 2 could have for their  security as well as for the security of the NATO alliance as a whole.  Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps Homeschool  Mr. President, homeschooling parents sacrifice a lot when they make  the legitimate and indeed very admirable choice to personally educate  their children. In effect, these parents are making the choice to go  back to school themselves so that their kids may receive well-rounded  and faithful educations.  Their sacrifices pay off in spades. Homeschooled students  consistently prove to be outstanding citizens because they are taught  the importance of patriotism, faith, hard work, and sacrifice--virtues  exemplified by their parents and their teachers.  Homeschooled students, therefore, ought to be prime candidates for  our Armed Forces for this very reason, but until now, in some places,  it hasn't been clear as to whether homeschooled [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7022\">Page S7022</a>, ] students have been eligible to join their local Junior Reserve  Officers' Training Corps Programs. Now that is going to change.  The 2020 National Defense Authorization Act includes my bill--also  sponsored by Senator Jones--which clarifies that homeschooled students  may indeed enroll in their local JROTC Programs. Our bill will ensure  that the Nation's 2.5 million homeschooled students will have the  opportunity to sharpen and deploy their skills in service of our  country. This will move us closer to being a society that fully accepts  and indeed celebrates homeschooling families for the noble paths they  have chosen.  PCS Act  Mr. President, the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act includes  many valuable reforms. One such reform is the PCS Act, which is  legislation I introduced with Senator Shaheen, that helps military  spouses keep their occupational licenses even when they are on the move  across State lines.  One in three military spouses works in a field that requires one to  have an occupational license, and too many spouses are forced to  recertify every time they move between States. That can be very often.  Most military families move every 2 to 3 years, and when each move  requires an expensive, time-consuming recertification process, many  military spouses might as well kiss their jobs goodbye. These  occupational licenses are a costly burden for military families, who  have already sacrificed so much for our country.  Our PCS Act will alleviate this burden by empowering the Department  of Defense and the States to negotiate interstate compacts for  occupational licenses in fields in which military spouses often work.  These compacts, which are made possible by our bill, will ensure that  military spouses will be able to pursue their careers uninterrupted  even while they are moving their families from State to State and base  to base. Most importantly, the PCS Act will allow military families to  focus on their mission, which is to protect and serve our country with  honor.  I yield the floor.

", "Mrs. GILLIBRAND": " Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment because, as it is written, it really rewards only companies  that are very wealthy and successful with additional tax credits to do  something they are already doing. By that measure, it will leave most  American workers without basic access to leave.  The other potential idea is about shifting hours and suggesting that  workers have to work overtime to be able to have paid leave. Every  parent in America, every person in America, will have a time when they  have a family crisis--whether it is a dying parent, whether it is a  sick spouse, whether it is a new child--and we are still the only  industrialized country in the world that doesn't have access to  national paid leave. We should be able to come together around this  commonsense solution that Senator Schatz has offered to create at least  the first step to make sure our Federal workers aren't  disproportionately harmed because they can't compete with the private  sector.  I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.    ", "Mr. ROMNEY": " Mr. ROMNEY. Madam President, I rise today to honor the extraordinary  service of one of Utah's most dedicated county commissioners, Mr.  Newell Harward. He has served Wayne County for the past 7 years, but he  has taken on responsibility well beyond that, advocating for rural Utah  with honor and distinction as chairman of the Six County Association of  Governments. Newell has had an esteemed career and life of service to  family, country, and God.  Growing up on the family farm in Loa, UT, Newell gained an early  appreciation for the value of community, family, and hard work. He also  developed a spirit of adventure, later serving a mission abroad in  Scotland and joining the Wayne County Flying Club.  As the founder of Harward and Rees Construction, Newell is also an  entrepreneur whose craftsmanship is literally built into Utah's  infrastructure. His company has undertaken everything from city water  projects, designs at Lake Powell, to a new bridge over Hell's Backbone  in Southern Utah.  Newell is perhaps most widely known as a public servant who was  elected to serve as Wayne County commissioner. After 4 years, Newell  considered stepping down due to illness, but he was undeterred. With a  writing campaign, Newell Harward was reelected in a landslide. In  October of this year, the President welcomed Newell to the White House  to recognize him for his lifelong advocacy on behalf of rural  Americans.  A true appreciation for Newell's life of service would be incomplete  without recognizing his unwavering faith and service to the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Newell has served in three  bishoprics, as bishop of a large ward, and in the stake presidency. As  a loving father to Kelly, Lynette, Sarah, Shonna, Carol, and Travis, a  grandfather to 18, and a great-grandfather to 3, Newell has left an  indelible mark on Wayne County, the great State of Utah, and indeed our  Nation.  All of us should strive to live our lives as Newell does, with an  overwhelming love of family and community, an enduring faith, and a  boundless spirit of adventure.  Newell, Gloria, and their family continue to be in our prayers as  they fight health challenges with great courage. May God bless the  Harward family.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    ", "Mrs. BLACKBURN": " Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam President, Alice's statement is loaded with  historical context and correctly implies that what we are seeing now is  the culmination of a slow but sure violation of the laws and norms that  once defined Hong Kong's semiautonomous relationship with mainland  China. These protests erupted after what Beijing argued was a simple  proposed change to existing extradition laws, but the people saw it for  what it was--a thinly veiled threat to Hong Kong's relative autonomy.  It wasn't a takeover. It was just that foot in the door, and China is  nearly unparalleled in its ability to turn a foot in the door into a  permanent existing condition.  Sometimes their power plays are very obvious, and sometimes they are  not. On my recent trip to Djibouti, I saw firsthand the influence of  China's debt-trap diplomacy.  Here is what debt-trap diplomacy is. It is a fancy way of saying that  China has increased its influence around the world by offering to  struggling nations that they are going to hold their debt in exchange  for preferential treatment on trade or maybe a physical presence such  as a port or other sweetheart deals.  In Djibouti City, I saw this tactic run wild. Now China would say  that what they have done is to help the Djiboutians create a ``smart  city'' in the Horn of Africa, but in reality they have negotiated their  way into creating a full-blown surveillance state.  Cameras are everywhere--on every corner and every street, with 24/7  footage--and guess where that footage lands. Beijing. They have even  tried to point one of those cameras at our military base, right at the  entrance to Camp Lemonnier.  Debt-trap diplomacy is bold. It is obvious. If that is all you see of  China, it is easy to assume that all of their tactics are that bold and  obvious. As I said, they will go after you in obvious areas and also in  areas that are not as obvious.  Even domestically, China's surveillance state is notoriously the  opposite of covert. Their domestic ``smart city'' program has outpaced  that of every other country on the face of the Earth and the majority  of their $70-plus billion budget for that project has been spent not on  intelligent power grids or traffic management systems or on clean air  or clean water, but it is being spent on surveilling their own  citizens.  The greatest danger China has created by engaging in brash and at  times absurd surveillance and suppression is that it has created a  false sense of security here in the West when we don't see the evidence  of what they are doing. In the United States we are not particularly  vulnerable to their debt trap, but we are vulnerable to less obvious  attempts to get that foot in the door.  In some form or another, most Americans have allowed Big Tech to take  hold of a portion of their lives. Smartphones and cloud storage once  were very novel, but now we assume that even simple transactions come  predicated by an additional condition. Everything is free as long as  the app or the service has access to--guess what--your data. They want  to own your virtual you.  Popular apps like TikTok, whose parent company is based in China,  have left me with more questions than answers about the platform's  business practices, privacy protections, and ideological loyalty to the  Communist [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7002\">Page S7002</a>, ] Party. Consider that the U.S. Army has barred soldiers from using  TikTok. Everybody needs to understand this. The U.S. Army has said: You  cannot use TikTok. This very body has expressed our concerns on a  bipartisan basis with the platform's censorship and data handling  practices.  It is no wonder that TikTok's chief executive officer canceled this  week's scheduled meetings here in DC with Members of this body. The  fact that millions of Americans, especially our American children,  continue to offer their personal data to TikTok is beyond disturbing,  but we will not be able to roll back the creeping surveillance state  without setting our own standards for what is acceptable from both  foreign and domestic companies.  When I introduced the BROWSER Act earlier this year, I did so not  only to give Big Tech solid guidelines regarding data privacy and  content but to set a new standard for what consumers expect from Big  Tech. Our problem here in this country is pretty much one of awareness  and of understanding that the exact same philosophy drives China's  surveillance programs and their less obvious but much more personal  individual monitoring schemes--their surveillance state scheme.  China's Communist Party is after more than just ad revenue and more  complete data sets. Their goal, as those Hong Kong protesters put it,  is to trick other countries in becoming more like China, which is not  tilting toward freedom but tilting away from freedom.  My goal with the BROWSER Act and with my focus on what has become the  surveillance state is to do the exact opposite--to enable freedom, to  encourage freedom, not only here but around the globe--and to make  certain that consumers here decide how much of their data they want to  be able to share. We must make certain that we continue to support the  cause of freedom wherever human beings show up to protect the freedoms  they have.  I yield the floor.

Madam President, today I rise for the opportunity to  commend Senator Johnny Isakson on his retirement from the U.S. Senate.  I am a relatively new Member to the Senate, but I think we all  remember the first time we ever walked onto the Senate floor. I know I  certainly do because that is the day I met Senator Johnny Isakson.  With both of us being from the South, I knew we would probably have a  lot in common, a similar view on life, and a heart for the South, but  it didn't take me long to learn that Johnny has a universal heart.  I am guilty of the expression, ``Nothing is special until you make it  special.'' Johnny has such a generous gift of making things special. He  has the gift of making everyone around him feel special. His heart and  his attitude sees the best in people and yet goes further to let them  know how much they mean to him.  He exemplifies being a leader, an encourager, and an investor of  people. He is never too busy to ask how you are doing or to ask about  your family. Common courtesy sometimes isn't always that common  anymore, but I assure you it is with Johnny Isakson.  His brilliance is unquestionable. His ability to articulate what is  important to him is just simply amazing. He can deliver a message that  not only expresses his concern but also has answers and solutions based  on his experience and his tremendous wisdom.  He is the gentle calm in a tremendous storm. He has the words of  wisdom when so many are bewildered. He is the guiding light in the  darkest times. He provides the needed laugh in times of tension and the  voice of reason in times of uncertainty. His love is deep, and his  compassion is true.  He knows how to be a friend. He was a born leader and has the ability  to capture opportunities and turn them into successes. My world has  been enhanced and enriched by this wonderful and precious human being.  Johnny learned a long time ago that the joy of living comes in  giving. You know when a person has in his heart that joy, that wasn't  put there by the world.  When I think about the true statesmen I have met in my brief time in  the Senate, I will certainly have ``Georgia on My Mind.''  Thank you.    ", "Mr. SCOTT": " Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, as a member of U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my honor to recognize a unique small business for its tremendous contributions to the local economy. Small businesses drive our Nation's economic expansion, generate lasting job growth, and encourage community development. This week, it is my honor to recognize Boyd Cycling of Greenville, SC, as the Senate Small Business of the Week. Boyd Johnson, a former competitive cyclist, originally founded Boyd Cycling under the name Boyd Bikes in September of 2009. Charged by a mission of quality and service, Boyd set out to produce and sell various bike products in the Greenville area. About 3 months into the operation, Boyd's Bikes began to grow dramatically, and Boyd's wife Nicole joined as a partner of the business. Boyd and Nicole are a prime example of how a leap of faith, coupled with hard work, can pay off. Boyd Bikes initially offered wheels, bike frames, handlebars, and other accessories, but the Johnsons quickly realized that their competitive advantage was their handcrafted wheels made out of carbon fiber and alloy. By 2011, Boyd and Nicole decided to focus directly on specializing in bike wheels and changed the name of the business to Boyd Cycling. In addition to focusing on bike wheels, Boyd and Nicole decided to shake up their business model. Originally, Boyd Cycling focused primarily on direct-to-consumer sales. Wanting to expand their business, Boyd and Nicole reached out to the Spartanburg Area Small Business Development Center, SBDC, a resource partner of the U.S. Small Business Administration, and received business counseling and exporting advice. Eventually, Boyd Cycling began selling their products to bike shops around the country in addition to their own website. By staying committed to high quality and low pricing, the Johnsons have been able to avoid undercutting their retail clients while diversifying their income stream. In turn, this has enabled them to export their products globally and now currently distribute to over 15 countries. A seasoned cyclist, Boyd spends time carefully designing each product the company offers. Once a product is developed, Boyd Cycling contracts manufacturing out to different firms domestically and internationally. Boyd maintains rigorous standards when contracting with every manufacturing firm that the company uses, making sure to implement quality controls on materials and construction methods. Boyd Cycling's dedication to quality has not gone unnoticed. They have received national media coverage, excellent customer reviews, and numerous awards. In 2017 and 2019, Boyd and Nicole were named the U.S. Small Business Administration's Exporter of the Year for South Carolina. This award recognizes small business owners for their success and commitment to exporting goods or services. Boyd Cycling also supports various philanthropies in their community including Meals on Wheels, the Alzheimers Foundation, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Miracle Hill, Upstate Forever, and Global Bike. Their community involvement has been a key to their success as Greenville has become a bustling hub for the recreational biking community. Boyd and Nicole truly embody the entrepreneurial and community spirit. From its humble beginnings, Boyd has grown into a respectable player in the industry while maintaining a commitment to customer service and product [[<a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S3283\">Page S3283</a>]] quality. I am honored to recognize the Johnsons and the entire team at Boyd Cycling as the Senate Small Business of the Week. You make South Carolina proud, and I look forward to watching your continued growth and success.<bullet>   ", "Mrs. HYDE-SMTIH": " Mrs. HYDE-SMTIH. Mr. President, it is an honor to pay tribute to Brig. Gen. Ernest Randolph ``Randy'' Webster, U.S. Air Force, retired, who passed away on June 2, 2019. A native of Midnight, MS, he served our country with distinction both stateside and abroad. General Webster, who was an Army ROTC student at Arkansas State University, joined the U.S. Marine Corps and became a helicopter pilot and intelligence officer while serving in the Vietnam War. Following his service in Vietnam, General Webster transferred to the Air Force Reserve, where he served in a variety of assignments, eventually rising to the rank of brigadier general. General Webster's final assignment was as commander of the 403rd Wing at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, MS. Also known as the Hurricane Hunters, the airmen 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, a component of the 403rd Wing, have the critical mission of flying into dangerous conditions to identify and assess storms developing in the Gulf of Mexico. The information they provide is crucial to allowing States and communities in the Gulf Coast region to prepare for severe storms. Under General Webster's leadership, the Hurricane Hunter aviators, along with support personnel, successfully fulfilled this vital mission of protecting Gulf Coast communities from weather-related disasters and further solidified their role as a key national asset. General Webster stayed true to form following his retirement in 2000 with 33 years of military service, dedicating himself to his family and volunteering his time to youth groups and his church. Our gratitude and condolences go out to his wife Martha Webster and the entire Webster family during this difficult time.<bullet>   ", "Mr. SENATOR": " Mr. SENATOR.

Madam President, it is my pleasure today to salute a  transformative leader in my home State of Kentucky, Dave Adkisson. At  the end of October, Dave will retire as the president and CEO of the  Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, ending nearly 15 years of representing  our Commonwealth's employers and signature industries. His talent for  advocacy and consensus-building have benefited Kentucky, and I would  like to thank him for his many achievements for our State.  Dave began his career at his hometown chamber of commerce in  Owensboro, KY. His creativity and successful management won him a lot  of fans early on, and he was elected the mayor of Owensboro at the age  of 34. Championing several development projects and attracting new  businesses to the city, Dave was reelected to a second term without  opposition.  Leaving public service, Dave accepted an offer to lead the  Birmingham, Alabama, Chamber. The career move took Dave's talents out  of Kentucky, but he wouldn't be gone for long. He returned home and  began his current role leading the statewide chamber. At the helm of  our Commonwealth's largest business association, Dave has grown the  organization and expanded its reach. Now, it represents more than 3,800  businesses in Kentucky.  As the leader of the Kentucky Chamber, Dave has made a positive and  lasting impact on the public policies enacted both in Frankfort and in  Washington. His organization helped lead the charge to pass a right-to- work law in Kentucky, giving workers more freedom over their paychecks  and drawing new investment into the Bluegrass State. Dave was also a  key ally in our drive to pass comprehensive Federal tax reform and cut  burdensome regulations. Kentucky's strong economy is a result, in part,  of Dave's leadership.  He has also been recognized nationally among his peers for his  important work. In 2017, the Kentucky Chamber was named the top chamber  in the country, and Dave has lent his expertise to several national  business associations. To foster future innovators, Dave cofounded  Leadership Kentucky, a highly selective program to equip prominent  Kentuckians with the skills to excel. It is just one example in a long  list of contributions Dave has made to improve our State's bright  future.  As Dave leaves the Kentucky Chamber, I am glad to know he will  continue leading various projects around the Commonwealth. I am sure  our communities will continue to benefit from his talent and guiding  hand. I am also reassured to know that, while Dave is spending some  well-deserved time with his wife Bonnie and their family, the Kentucky  Chamber will be in the capable hands of its new president, Ashli Watts.  A seasoned advocacy veteran, Ashli can build upon the years of success  and help the Kentucky Chamber continue to be a strong voice for our  state's job creators.  So, Mr. President, I would like to thank Dave for his years of  leadership in Kentucky. As an elected official and a public policy  advocate he has created a legacy of accomplishment that will be enjoyed  for years to come. It is a privilege to pay tribute to my friend today,  and I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in honoring Dave Adkisson and  wishing him a fulfilling retirement.    ", "Ms. BLACKBURN": " Ms. BLACKBURN. Madam President, over the past few months, pro- democracy protestors in Hong Kong have captivated the American  consciousness with one of the most stunning mass protests in recent  memory. Hong Kong people are no strangers to suppression. They are used  to the censorship, digital stalking, and persecution embraced by their  overlords in Beijing, and they have seen firsthand the dangers of  tyranny.  Watching these protests play out got me thinking about the core  values that [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S6501\">Page S6501</a>, ] we as the American people share with the Hong Kong people and with so  many others around the globe. There is really an interesting dichotomy  at play: You can turn on the TV right now and see an entire population  fighting desperately on behalf of free speech, self-expression, and the  right to question their leaders' decisions.  Meanwhile, just a few countries away, the loudest voices in the  newsroom are begging for just the opposite. Here in the U.S., Americans  are constantly being asked if freedom is really worth the fight. Is it  worth the never-ending battle to maintain it? The answer is absolutely.  When Americans look at the protests in Hong Kong, they do not see a  foreign policy gray area; they see scores of revolutionaries fighting  an evil regime. They identify with the disrupters, and they cheer for  the underdogs who do not pull their punches, which is why, in 2016,  they sent a disrupter to the White House.  They watch the hysteria that is cable news commentary and get the  sense that the people on the screen have completely missed the point.  The fight is not and never will be about one person or one movement. It  is about the decision to protect liberty or to let liberty die; to  protect justice or to let it die. To dismiss this point is to disparage  the most important feature of the collaborative American psyche. When  asked if freedom is worth fighting for, the answer will always be yes.  The calculus flows into discussions on almost every aspect of  American life. Most recently, at home and in this Chamber, debate has  centered on the ideological makeup of the Federal judiciary. We have  repeatedly asked ourselves: Will the judges we are confirming respect  and protect the core values of the American people? The answer is yes,  they absolutely will.  This is not the first time the American public has swung back around  to consider our ``first principles.'' We talked about them in the early  90s and again--perhaps more passionately--in the early 2000s. Last  week, I was fortunate enough to attend an event at the White House  celebrating our success in confirming well-qualified, constitutionalist  judges to the Federal bench. We have filled 158 vacancies since 2017,  and we are far from done.  I am sure, however, that my friends in the minority wish we would  give it a rest, but we won't. After all, they have had to work overtime  trying to convince the American people that our job is to impose by  judicial decree policies that were rejected at the ballot box. They  want to do this without the benefit of legislative debate or public  comment, which means that confirming constitutionalist judges is far  from being in their best interest.  So here they come, insisting that ``constitutionalist'' is a dog  whistle for racism, sexism, homophobia, and holding regressive and  extreme ideas.  What a ridiculous strategy. The bipartisan nominees this body has  confirmed proved they are capable of resisting the urge to get creative  with the law when it suits the loudest voices in the room. Instead,  they apply the same foresight employed by the Founding Fathers. These  judges know that permitting the government more powers to mold and  manipulate society will give rise to a government that will never  resist the temptation to overstep its bounds.  Our courts are not courts of public opinion, and my friends in the  minority would do well to remember the cost of treating them as such.  Constitutionalism is our legacy and our inheritance. I urge my  colleagues to remember this because we are going to vote to confirm  judges who have proven themselves committed to defending our core  values and the rule of law in the United States of America.  Madam President, I yield the floor.    "}
