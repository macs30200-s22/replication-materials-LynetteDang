David Kustoff,0.2931984663009643,R," Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Suzette Mink, from Millington, Tennessee, for her strong service to  Shelby County government as she is set to retire in a few weeks.  Suzette's service to Memphis and Shelby County started in 1985 when  she began working for the Shelby County Trustee's Office. From there,  she [["", Page , H4434, ] worked for the Shelby County general sessions court clerk, the general  sessions criminal court judges' office, and then the general sessions  civil court judges' office, where she will retire after 17 years of  faithful service to these judges.  In 2019, Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris awarded Suzette with the  Shelby County Shining Star Award. This award is given to someone who  has shown exemplary dedication to their job within Shelby County  government, and this award was much deserved.  I know I speak on behalf of all of Memphis and Shelby County, and the  judges, when I thank Suzette for her service to our community. When I  think of true public servants, we talk about people like Suzette.  I wish her and her husband, Derrick, the best in their retirement.    "
