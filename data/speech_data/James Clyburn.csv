James Clyburn,0.8380640745162964,D," Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, while today's vote to provide relief to  families who are suffering due to circumstances far beyond their  control is welcome, it is long overdue and insufficient to fully meet  their needs.  Democrats put forth our priorities last May to bring relief to those  who are sick, unemployed, homeless, and hungry. Republicans instead  chose to ignore and obfuscate the widespread suffering.  This short-term package will provide direct payments and unemployment  benefits extension and some assistance to help families afford rent,  food, water, and broadband. I applaud our Speaker for negotiating these  critical provisions and my colleagues who came together in a bipartisan  way to drive this compromise, but this package must be viewed only as a  downpayment.  Most of us can hardly wait to begin the new year with renewed hope.  Our resolve as we come into 2021 with a new Congress and a new  administration is to provide the leadership and support Americans need  and deserve to get us beyond this pandemic. There can be no greater  pursuit in 2021.    "
