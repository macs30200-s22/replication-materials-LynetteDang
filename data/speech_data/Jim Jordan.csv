Jim Jordan,0.0099401362240314,R," Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, House Democrats started the week off with a hearing on  letting criminals out of jail early. They end the week with a bill  legalizing drugs. And they want the American taxpayers to pay for both  programs.  They introduced a bill earlier in the year to give grant dollars to  States to let criminals out of jail early, even violent ones, according  to the letter Mr. Nadler and Chairwoman Bass sent to the Attorney  General. Now, they want to create a trust fund in this bill to give  grants to the marijuana industry and finance the marijuana industry.  Mr. Speaker, these are the actions the Democrats take, the first  actions they take after a national election. Go figure. Maybe that is  why they lost 27 out of 27 toss-up seats around the country. Maybe that  is why our party almost took back the majority.  That is what they choose to focus on at a time when you have Democrat  leaders around the country defunding the police, locking down  businesses, destroying small businesses all over our Nation. This is  what they choose to focus on. This is what they choose to focus on.  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, let me indicate very quickly that every 37 seconds,  between 2001 and 2010, there were 8 million arrests, every 37 seconds,  for marijuana. We spent $3.6 billion on the war on marijuana, and it  has not worked. We do today what saves lives.  We know that States are going to be able to continue to protect their  children, and this does not undermine the ability of Congress to  protect children as well. In every State that has legalized marijuana,  they have developed a comprehensive set of regulations to protect  consumers.  We also recognize that this issue of vaping is not generated by  marijuana use. With a comprehensive structure, we will be able to  protect children and not be selling marijuana to children. Those who  have died in our communities may now live. As well, we will further  understand the importance of a structure that is about restoration of  justice. The imbalance against people of color has been a tragedy.  Mr. Speaker, the MORE Act is crucial to be able to pass, and I ask my  colleagues to do so vigorously as we also fight COVID-19.  Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would like to thank the following  Members and committee and Member staff for their outstanding work on  the MORE Act: Joe Graupensperger, Milagros Cisneros, Christine Leonard,  Barbara Lee, Earl Blumenauer, Nydia Velazquez, and Frank Pallone.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
