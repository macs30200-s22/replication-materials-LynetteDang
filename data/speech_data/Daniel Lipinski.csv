Daniel Lipinski,0.8227047920227051,D," Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, when I was a professor teaching American  Government before I was elected to Congress, the first thing I would do  when beginning to teach a class about Congress and the legislative  process would be to show this video. It is the 3-minute ``Schoolhouse  Rock'' cartoon video from the 1970s called ``I'm Just a Bill.''  The cartoon begins with a group of constituents calling their  Congressman with an idea for a new law. The Congressman introduces a  bill, which goes through House committee debate and amendment before a  vote to report the bill favorably to the House floor.  On the floor, the bill goes through debate and amendment before a  majority vote that sends the bill over to the Senate, where the process  continues.  This is a process that we call regular order. Regular order in the  House is a standard way of legislating that facilitates extensive  participation of Members in the deliberative, consensus-based  decisionmaking process.  More importantly, this is how the Framers of the Constitution not  only intended the House to work, but believed that the House needed to  work if the United States, then in its infancy, was to succeed.  Congress was created in Article I of the Constitution because the  legislative branch, being closest to the people, was necessarily the  linchpin of American representative democracy.  While the Framers didn't include in the Constitution the rules by  which the House and Senate would operate, they understood that the way  in which the lawmaking process was conducted was critical to the  creation of laws that were good for the Nation as a whole and to the  legitimacy of Congress and those laws.  James Madison, oftentimes called the Father of Congress, believed it  was essential that the legislative branch make policy in the manner  that well represented the vast and varied Republic and best served the  Nation as a whole.  Remember, our Nation began as a unique experiment in self-governance.  There was great doubt about whether the views of people so diverse  could successfully be forged into good policy that served such a large  nation.  Madison believed that the way to do this was for Members of Congress  to represent the multiple and diverse interests and ideas of their  constituents in an open marketplace of ideas in Congress. Through the  legislative process, the people's Representatives would debate,  deliberate, and put together a consensus on legislation that served the  common good of the Nation.  What the Constitution created was not a parliamentary system, because  the Framers did not intend to empower temporary majorities. Instead,  they wanted to compel compromise in a diverse society.  The exercise of power was shared so that all American voters had an  opportunity to be heard in the lawmaking process and to ensure that  only the will of broad, durable majorities could be acted upon.  Especially because America was a large and diverse country whose unity  needed to be nurtured, it was critical that the legislative process  worked this way so that the American people saw Congress as an  institution that truly represented them and saw American law as  legitimate.  But today, the House doesn't often work this way, especially when we  deal with issues that are of the greatest importance to our Nation.  Those bills, when they get considered, don't get shaped through an open  process in committee and on the House floor. Each Member doesn't have  the opportunity to represent their constituents by bringing their ideas  and interests in the legislative process where debate, deliberation,  and compromise produce the best policy for our Nation. Instead, the  process runs through the Speaker's Office, where the content of  legislation is shaped to get enough votes just out of the majority to  pass something that pleases various partisans.  Now, before I go any further, I want to make clear that this is not a  criticism of the current Speaker or any former Speaker. This is a  problem of our institution.  So how did we get here?  Well, there has been a big change in the way Washington reacts every  2 years after a congressional election. It used to be the case that,  when election results came in, everyone looked to see which party has  the majority in the House, who has the majority in the Senate and  whether it had 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, and which party held  the White House.  Understanding that balance of power and the issues facing our Nation  over the next 2 years, Members of Congress would get to work figuring  out what issues they may be able to come to an agreement on and get  passed into law over the next 20 months or so before the next campaign  cycle began.  Now, today, what happens is, after understanding the balance of power  in Washington after an election, each party retreats to its corner and  begins plotting what their party is going to do over the next 2 years.  If there is unified government--that is, one party has majorities in  both Chambers of Congress and the Presidency--here in the House, the  Speaker will consider the priorities of the party and decide what  issues to make their legislative priorities over the next 2 years to  create party-preferred laws and keep that majority.  If there is divided government, which is the norm, having occurred 30  out of the last 40 years, and if you include the filibuster, 39\\1/2\\  out of the last 40 years, if that is the case, the Speaker plans what  the party can do over the next 2 years to help the party gain unified  control of the government with the hope of them passing all of the  party's preferred policies. On the other side of the aisle, they figure  out what they can do over those 2 years so they can get control.  In order to help the party carry out this biennial plan, Members of  Congress have given up much of their power to represent their  constituents in the legislative process to party leaders.  So what has this led to?  Gridlock. There are so many issues we need to address in this Nation  and we fail to act: healthcare costs, the Federal debt, immigration,  climate change, the economic and military threat of China, Social  Security and Medicare finances, transportation infrastructure, the  continuing decline of good working-class jobs, and reforming the War  Powers Act.  These are just some of the major issues which Congress has been  failing [["", Page , H7037, ] to address. I am sure there are other major ones that I just missed.  The one obligation that Congress has each year--passing  appropriations bills to fund the government--is almost never  accomplished on time.  Presidents have stepped in to fill the policymaking void. They now  wield power even to address issues that were specifically put in the  hands of Congress in the Constitution.  Increased Presidential exercise of power on policy has resulted in  policy whipsawing back and forth depending on the Presidential  administration. Lawmaking by executive order has become the norm, so  much so that ``Saturday Night Live'' even did a parody of ``I'm Just a  Bill,'' replacing ``bill'' with an executive order. And this President  has taken it to a new level.  But no matter who the President has been, few of us stand up for our  institution. We only criticize Presidential overreach when it is a  policy that we don't like.  And it is not only the President who has gained power because  Congress is failing to act. The courts have also stepped in as  activists and have turned to the judicial system to settle policy  issues in the absence of Congress.  So what we have now is an imperial Presidency and powerful courts  with a Congress that largely sits gridlocked.  What happens when we have unified government in those rare times?  The last two times this occurred, major policy changes were passed on  completely party-line votes. The minority party then attacked the  legitimacy of these laws.  Now, I am not saying that these laws were illegitimate--they were  not--but the Framers knew that this kind of attack would happen if we  did not come together to forge compromises.  Now, in both these cases when unified government occurred, the last  two times it happened, in the next election the House majority was  changed by the American people.  Today, Congress is failing in ways that the Founders feared. In  Senator Lamar Alexander's farewell address to the Senate, he defended  the filibuster, saying that what is needed to make the Senate work  better is not a change of rules but a change of behavior.  Unfortunately, I believe that we need some of both.  {time} 2100  Over the past 4 years, I have been a Member of the House Problem  Solvers Caucus. The Caucus is a bipartisan group of about 50 members,  evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. We meet every week to  talk policy and build relationships. Our goal is to work together to  get to ``yes'' on policies that are good for our country. I greatly  enjoyed the Caucus because not only have I been able to build  friendships, but was able to participate in a microcosm of what Madison  envisioned for the House.  The Problem Solvers Caucus doesn't always succeed in forging  compromise because sometimes it has been out of our reach, but we have  taken on some big issues. I was part of a Problem Solvers Caucus  working group that was put together after President Trump said he was  going to eliminate DACA, and then told Speaker Pelosi and Senate  Democrat Leader Schumer he would help work out a legislative solution  to protect these immigrants who were brought to the United States as  children--the Dreamers.  The President never followed through on that, but the Caucus believed  that there was a bipartisan agreement that we could work out that  granted the opportunity for citizenship to millions, who we argued were  deserving of this, while putting into place policies to prevent future  illegal immigration.  Our working group's meetings usually started at 9 p.m. because that  was the time of day that everyone was free from every other obligation  that we have around here. We would get together--Democrats and  Republicans--learn from each other and from experts of our current law,  discuss our views and our constituents' views on what law should be,  what should be done. Honestly, work through every minute detail of a  compromise.  We worked late into the night. A few times, I had to run out to catch  the last metro train at Union Station at 11:30 so I can get back to my  apartment. It was hard work, but enjoyable. And we came up with a  compromise that was endorsed by a bipartisan group of 50 members, just  as we had come up with a compromise legislation in the same manner  which would have helped strengthen the Affordable Care Act and made it  more affordable. But in the end, despite our agreement, we could not  get legislation on either of these issues to the floor.  We had good policy for our Nation, which probably could have gotten  the majority of the House to pass it, and possibly been able to get it  through Senate with bipartisan support. We got there by bringing our  constituents' ideas and interests to the table, debating, deliberating,  forging a compromise, but the rules did not give us an avenue to bring  this agreement to the House.  In the summer of 2018, when the Problem Solvers Caucus proposed  changes to the House rules, I said this: ``Our Constitution empowered  the American people by empowering Congress and their representatives.  But Congressional rules are now rigged in a way that greatly diminishes  our ability to represent our constituents. This has resulted in a  Congress that doesn't work and is frozen in partisan gridlock, allowing  the President and the courts to grab the power that is supposed to be  held by the American people. By instituting these proposed reforms, we  will begin to restore this power, break partisan gridlock, and  facilitate congressional problem-solving that will help us build a  better America for future generations.''  We made a little bit of progress in changing rules, but much more is  needed. Much more is needed to make this great institution work as it  was intended by the Framers of the Constitution to work for the  American people, and I am hopeful that those changes will occur and the  Problem Solvers Caucus will be successful in the next couple of weeks  and in the next Congress because American people need it.  Now, despite the ways in which the House falls short these days, good  work still happens here because everyone who gets elected to the House  does so because they want to make a difference. And there are still  ways that we can succeed for our constituents.  During my time representing the people of the Third District of  Illinois, I have always said that my goal every day was to make life a  little better for my constituents and our country. And I knew that I  had a whole team of staffers there to help me.  Recently, as I was driving out to Washington, I was listening to  former Senator Al Franken's book, ``Giant of the Senate.'' As an early  ``Saturday Night Live'' watcher, I enjoyed the book very much, and  Senator Franken was very candid on a lot of things. One of the most  important truths that Franken mentioned, which is rarely spoken around  here, is that Members of Congress are never supposed to admit that  their staff was responsible for an idea or for being indispensable in  getting something done. He says that he once publicly gave credit to a  staffer for an idea, and he was told by a colleague not to do that.  It is always the Senator who has the idea and does the work, he was  told. Franken thought that was wrong, and I agree. Maybe because I was  a staffer before I was elected.  So as I look back on everything that I have done over 16 years, I  thank all the staff that worked for me over the years. These are some  of the things that we were able to accomplish. We were able to author  16 laws, and I was the chief Democratic cosponsor on 11 other laws.  Promoting American manufacturing jobs was a priority for me, having  grown up in and now representing the southwest side of Chicago. We were  able to get signed into law the Customs Training Enhancement Act to  stop illegal goods coming into the country; the Small Aircraft  Revitalization Act to help American aviation manufacturers; the Steel  and Aluminum Energy Conservation and Technology Competitiveness Act  Reauthorization to help these manufacturers thrive; and numerous Buy  America provisions that we were able to get into transportation and  other laws.  Mr. Speaker, but the one I am most proud of is the American  Manufacturing and Competitiveness Act, which took 5 years to get done  but resulted in the first comprehensive American manufacturing strategy  plan to be produced by the Federal Government since [["", Page , H7038, ] Alexander Hamilton. It is a good plan, and I am hopeful that the Biden  administration considers its recommendations.  To protect the environment against climate change, we got the H-Prize  Act and the BRIGHT Energy Savings Act into law. To protect victims of  sexual assault in the military, we got the SANE Deployment Act into an  NDAA. For veterans, we got the Purple Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal  Access Act and the Tarawa MIA Recovery Act.  As an engineer, I love the Committee on Science, Space, and  Technology. We did much on that committee to increase funding for  scientific research and to boost technological innovation activities of  the Federal Government. I was proud to author the National Science  Foundation Reauthorization Act of 2010. NSF continues to be the gold  standard of all international scientific research and innovation  agencies.  The most successful program that we were involved with has been the  Innovation Corps, or I-Corps, program. I was the nonstop promoter of  this program, which teaches university faculty and graduate students  about entrepreneurship and has helped launched dozens of startups. We  were able to grow that program at NSF and expand it to many other  Federal departments and agencies. We were also able to get an offshoot  hacking for defense set up at the DOD.  Representing the heart of the transportation hub of our Nation, we  were able to accomplish much for northeastern Illinois and the Nation  in transportation. Locally, we brought home hundreds of millions of  dollars in Federal money to improve local transportation, including  funding for roads, bridges, public transportation, sidewalks and bike  lanes, and airports.  We helped get a billion dollars for the CREATE rail modernization  program to improve the rail network in the region and alleviate some  blocked crossings. We added commuter train service on Metra's Heritage  Corridor and SouthWest Service lines. We got funding for a new tower at  Lewis University Airport and for rail underpasses in Bedford Park in  Bridgeview. Midway Airport has been made safer and more successful as  an economic engine for the southwest side.  I want to thank individually the staff here in D.C. that made all  this possible:  Staff assistants, Veronica Neuberger, Sarah Pittenger, Noah  Woodiwiss.  Legislative correspondents, Brian Freedman, Elizabeth Kelly.  Legislative assistants, Keith Devereaux, Wendy Adams, Carl Roberts,  Chris Lyons, Kim Koleos, Juri Jacoby, Emily Chibnall, Adam Weiss,  Andrew Hoffner, and Paul Dorsey.  Senior policy advisors, Joel Creswell, the late Andrew Davis, Sofya  Leonova, Jonathan Freye, Caitlyn McGuire, Ashley Musselman.  For all 16 years, our office administrator, Jennifer Sypolt.  Our communications directors over the years: Joel Reed, Phil  Davidson, the late Chris Ganschow, Nathanial Zimmer, Isaac Sancken, and  our digital press manager, Grace Graunke.  Legislative directors, John Veysey II, John Rattliff, Ryan Quinn,  Jason Day, and Alexander Beckmann.  Chiefs of staff, Jason Tai, Jaclyn O'Day, Brian Oszakiewski, Michael  McLaughlin, and Eric Lausten.  Mr. Speaker, I thank all of them for the great work that they have  done for me and for the people of the Third District of Illinois. I was  going to start naming Members that had helped me get all this work  done, but I know the danger in this business of leaving anyone out, so  I will just thank all of my colleagues for the work that we have done  together over these last 16 years.  Back in the district, we had what I would argue hands down was the  best constituent service in the Nation, whether it was helping  constituents with issues related to Social Security, Medicare,  veterans' benefits and military service, immigration issues, passport  issues, mail delivery issues, and many, many more issues.  The staff included Anthony Constantine, Yareli Cortez, Dawn Courtney,  Salvatore DiFranco, Jessica Jaroch, Chris Jutton, Joseph Kirkoff, Jean  Krupa, Josh Luke, John McGlynn, Frank Salerno, the late Zac Plantz, the  late Marianne Viverito.  Over the last few years, we have lost a number of staffers. It has  been very difficult, but we have grieved together as a staff and we are  thankful to all those departed staffers and their families.  Over the years, Jerry Hurckes was the chief of staff in the Chicago  office for most of my time in Congress and he ran that office and ran  the district for me.  Lenore Goodfriend was there for most of my time, and she is well- loved by veterans across the district.  Joe Bonomo, who is now my district director, has been with me for all  16 years. Joe has done a great job.  Paula Belmonte, who has been there 16 years also, has helped so many  immigrants, and we had a few that we saved from being deported.  And last, but not least, Jerry Mulvihill, who was probably, I would  argue, the best case worker in the history of the Congress. Jerry has  been called a saint more times than I could ever count for all the work  he did for so many people for so many years not just on Federal issues,  but any issue that anyone ever brought to Jerry. He is the only staffer  I know who was ever written up multiple times in the Chicago newspaper  for what he did for people.  Mr. Speaker, all these people made it work and did so much for all  the residents of the Third District, and I thank them so much.  Finally, I thank my mother, who gave me the love of learning; and my  father, who helped give me the love of politics; but above all, they  both gave me a love of helping others, as my mother was a teacher and  my father served in the Chicago City Council before he served here.  I also thank my wife, Judy, who thought she was marrying a lifelong  professor but then provided me with more support than I could have ever  hoped for in this job. It is only those spouses of Members who know  everything that it takes and everything they go through. So I thank  Judy so much for her support.  Lastly, I thank the people of Illinois' Third District, who gave me  the honor and privilege of serving as their representative.  {time} 2115  Mr. Speaker, the greatness of our Nation springs from the founding  principles which sound common to us today but were radical for their  time: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are  created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain  unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness.''  I still believe that this is the greatest Nation in the history of  the world. It is not perfect because humans aren't perfect, and we  cannot be perfected. But we must pray and work every day that each of  us and our Nation better uphold the principle of equality, and we had  better protect the life and liberty every day for every person, from  the very first moment of life until natural death. With God's grace, we  will do that, and we will be that shining city upon the hill for all  the world to see and follow.  God bless this institution, and God bless the United States of  America.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
