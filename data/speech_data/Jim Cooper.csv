Jim Cooper,0.0397605448961257,D," Mr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I am pleased to support the fiscal year 2021 National Defense  Authorization Act. Thankfully, maintaining a tradition of  bipartisanship to get the 60th, a record, National Defense  Authorization Act through the House and then through conference with  the Senate is no small feat, particularly during a global pandemic.  I thank, in particular, our outstanding Chairman Smith and Ranking  Member Thornberry for their leadership, as well as Ranking Member Mike  Turner for his partnership in the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, and  all of the conferees for getting to this point.  In particular, I would like to thank Ranking Member Thornberry for  his extraordinary leadership on the HASC over the last 6 years, and I  am happy to congratulate my friend and colleague, Mike Rogers, as the  next HASC ranking member.  The Strategic Forces provisions in the bill would not have been in  place without the outstanding staff work of Leonor Tomero, Maria  Vastola, and Grant Schneider as the lead staffers.  These provisions support our nuclear forces and nuclear  nonproliferation. They also enhance oversight of the warhead  acquisition and plutonium pit production programs, which continue to be  major undertakings. [["", Page , H6924, ]  The conference report supports regional missile defense efforts,  restores funding to critical radar discrimination capabilities, and  provides needed oversight on the next generation of interceptors in  order to ensure fly-before-you-buy principles in this $10 billion  program.  The report acknowledges the increased focus on development and  delivery of conventional hypersonic weapons, while also initiating  efforts to address broad policy concerns regarding the risk of  miscalculation as these new strategic-level weapons are fielded.  With regard to the rapidly transforming space domain, the conference  report supports innovative commercial capabilities, competition, and  the emergence of small-launch providers to provide national security as  well as the codification of the Space Development Agency's mission.  Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong vote in favor of this conference report.    "
