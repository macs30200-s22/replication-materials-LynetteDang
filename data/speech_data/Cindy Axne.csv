Cindy Axne,1.337895750999451,D," Mrs. AXNE. Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to cosponsor this amendment  today, to ensure that no taxpayer dollars go toward advancing a lawsuit  that literally threatens the livelihood of millions of Americans.  Mr. Speaker, since 2017, we have seen an administration obsessed with  undermining, sabotaging, and repealing a law that protects millions  living with preexisting conditions in this country.  As we end another month of a devastating health crisis that has taken  the lives of 150,000 Americans, they are doubling down and insisting-- and I quote their own words here--``the ACA must fall.''  This isn't only extraordinarily tone-deaf. It is playing politics  with the lives of people in this country, including Iowans.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman from Illinois  has expired.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to "", House Resolution 1067, ', the  previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Underwood).  The question is on the amendment.  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appear to have it.    "
