Kevin McCarthy,0.3992102742195129,R," Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Johnny  Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits  Improvement Act of 2020, a bipartisan legislative package that includes  two bills that I have proudly introduced this Congress, the VET TEC  Expansion Act and the Reducing Veteran Homelessness Act of 2020.  Since coming to Congress in 2007, one of my most important priorities  in this Chamber has been to protect and improve the benefits that our  Nation's veterans have earned and deserve. I introduced the VET TEC  Expansion Act and the Reducing Veteran Homelessness Act earlier this  Congress in response to comments and feedback I received from veterans  and veterans organizations throughout my district and across the  country.  Both pieces of legislation seek to build upon existing veterans  benefits programs, including the VET TEC pilot program and the HUD-VA  Supportive Housing Program, by expanding and streamlining them for  veterans and veterans service providers who utilize them.  The VET TEC Expansion Act will continue to ensure that our heroes can  enhance skills they developed in the military when returning to private  life by providing access to nontraditional and technology-oriented  courses through the VET TEC pilot program. This bill would expand VET  TEC to include part-time courses and permit additional course providers  into the VET TEC pilot program.  I am also pleased that "", H.R. 7105, "", like the initial House-passed  version of this bill, would increase the VET TEC funding authorization  by $30 million per year through 2023 to help the VA meet demand for  this popular program with our veterans.  In addition, no veteran in my district or anywhere in the country  should be homeless due to unnecessary VA staffing vacancies. The  Reducing Veteran Homelessness Act would require that the VA contract  out any consistently vacant HUD-VA Supportive Housing case management  positions to community experts so that unused housing vouchers can be  matched with homeless veterans who need them the most.  Finally, I want to take a moment to thank Dr. Roe for his unwavering  commitment to our Nation's veterans throughout his time in this  Congress, specifically as chairman and ranking member of the House  Veterans' Affairs Committee over the course of the past 4 years and for  his own personal service to the United States Army, serving in Korea.  His strong leadership on behalf of our fellow veterans has been  unwavering since he came to Congress, and his tenacity, knowledge, and  friendship will be missed in this Chamber after he retires from  Congress.  On behalf of a very grateful Nation, we thank Dr. Roe for his  servant's heart, for putting the veterans first, and for improving the  quality of the care for them.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join  me in supporting this bipartisan bill and thanking Congressman Roe for  his service.    "
