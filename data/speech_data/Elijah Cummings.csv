Elijah Cummings,3.022744655609131,D," Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Madam Speaker, some of my colleagues have argued that holding  Secretary Ross and Attorney General Barr in contempt of Congress is  premature. That is simply not true. If anything, it is long overdue.  The Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice have failed  to comply with congressional requests for more than a year. The  Oversight and Reform Committee Democrats first asked for documents from  the Department of Commerce in April of 2018 and from the Department of  Justice May of 2018. Those requests were ignored.  When I became chairman, I renewed those requests. In response, the  administration produced thousands of pages. But most of the documents  were either heavily redacted, already public, or nonresponsive to the  committee's request. So the committee narrowed its request and issued  bipartisan subpoenas to compel production of that narrow group of  documents. That was in April, more than 3 months ago.  I even asked Secretary Ross to meet with me personally. He refused.  And, last month, the committee passed the bipartisan resolution  before us to hold Secretary Ross and Attorney General Barr in contempt  of Congress. Still neither department has provided the documents that  we have asked for.  So I have come to the floor to urge our Members to vote in favor of  this. I do not, again, bring this lightly. This is not theater. This is  about doing our job. This is about protecting the integrity of not only  our census, but of our Congress.  Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to vote for this resolution, and I  yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the  resolution.  The question is on adoption of the resolution.  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    "
