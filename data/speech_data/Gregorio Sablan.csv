Gregorio Sablan,2.349644660949707,D," Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, ', H.R. 7105, ', the Veterans Health Care and  Benefits Improvement Act, includes my bill helping get more funding for  operations and maintenance to locally-run, veterans cemeteries  nationwide.  My legislation, ', H.R. 5487, ', increases the amount the VA can grant for  this purpose each year from $5 million to $10 million. As more veterans  choose to be buried close to their home, more states, territories, and  tribal governments are applying for funding from the VA to help cover  the costs of operating and maintaining local veterans cemeteries.  And, while the list of applications grows, the amount the Department  can award has not. Under current law, no more than $5 million can be  awarded per year to meet the needs of over 100 cemeteries.  ', H.R. 5487, "", the Veterans Cemetery Grants Improvement Act updates that  authorization by a modest $5 million. The Act will help veteran  cemeteries in every state, territory, and tribal nation, remain the  dignified and well-maintained resting places our veterans deserve.  I know in my own district, the Northern Mariana Islands, the veterans  cemetery, built with federal funds, faces challenges in this respect.  Veterans' families have come to me for help and this bill responds.  I know my co-sponsor, Representative Steil, shares this concern for  the Southern Wisconsin Veterans Memorial Cemetery in his district, as  do other Members for the cemeteries that serve their constituents.  And I know the members of this House are committed to honoring our  nation's veterans and their families, who have sacrificed so much to  ensure our country remains safe and free.  I thank Chairman Takano and Senator Tester for all their support to  include into "", H.R. 7105, ' this important measure.  I ask my colleagues to support ', H.R. 7105, '.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) that the House suspend the rules  and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, ', H.R. 7105, '.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
