Filemon Vela,0.360860526561737,D," Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Emily J. Alpert for her  22 years of extraordinary work and dedication to the Brownsville  Community Health Center Corporation as the director of operations.  Emily has been instrumental in transforming the Brownsville Community  Health Center into the beacon of excellent healthcare services it is  today. Her work embodies the philosophy of providing quality care that  preserves the dignity of all human beings, a philosophy engrained in  the Rio Grande Valley.  For these reasons, I would like to ask my colleagues to join the  Brownsville Community Health Center and me in congratulating Emily on  her retirement and wishing her well in all of her future endeavors.
