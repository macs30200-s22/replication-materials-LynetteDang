Sanford Bishop,1.2581554651260376,D," Mr. BISHOP of UTAH. Mr. Chair, unlike the other amendments that we  have had, this is the only one that is added here that actually has had  a hearing. It has had a markup, it has gone through regular order, and  it is the only one that is not doing something that is duplicative.  This is a problem that does exist and trying to make it to actually  happen. Everything else we have talked about is stuff that is nice, but  it is duplicative. It doesn't actually do anything. This is the only  one that does something, and it does something in a positive way.    "
