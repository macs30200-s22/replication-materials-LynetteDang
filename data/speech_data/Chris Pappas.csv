Chris Pappas,1.0586532354354858,D," Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano for getting this  important legislation to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of "", H.R. 7105, "", a crucial piece of  veterans legislation that aptly bears the name of our distinguished  ranking member, Dr. Roe.  The bill now includes three pieces of legislation that I introduced  to ensure VA is able to fulfill its mission of supporting all those who  have borne the battle. These three provisions will help improve the  quality of care and address deficiencies that frustrate and even harm  our veterans.  The first requires VA to address bureaucratic waste, fraud, abuse,  and mismanagement identified by the Government Accountability Office's  High Risk List.  A second provisions honors the sacrifices of our female veterans by  ensuring they have access to properly fitted prosthetic items, just as  their male counterparts do.  The third focuses on punitive debt collection practices by VA against  our veterans, many of whom have done everything right. This provision  sets limits on when VA may initiate collection proceedings and even  gives our veterans the ability to update crucial benefit information  online.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the House and Senate committees for getting this  bipartisan bill to the floor, and I urge my colleagues to pass this  legislation today.  Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington), who served on the Veterans'  Affairs Committee and the Ways and Means Committee. He has been a  tireless advocate for veterans during that time.  Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, there would not be a Texas if it  were not for Tennessee.    "
