Alex Mooney,0.0795210897922515,R," Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, there are good parts of  this bill, the things President Trump asked for at the very beginning,  like tax relief for employers, help for those who lost their jobs, and  funding for the medical community and first responders. I thank  President Trump for his excellent leadership.  I had a couple of ideas I would have liked to offer as amendments to  this bill, but this is a closed process. 435 Members of Congress can't  even offer amendments. That is not the way we are supposed to make  legislation, especially when it spends $2 trillion. [["", Page , H1842, ]  There are parts of this bill that are unrelated to the coronavirus:  $1 billion for Amtrak, money for National Public Radio and the arts.  But what we are not talking about is how we are going to pay for  this. We all agree about spending $2 trillion, but how are we going to  pay for it? Are we going to borrow from China? Are we going to borrow  it from Russia? Are we going to just print the money and devalue our  current currency? That is not being talked about.  The interest on the national debt every year is already about half a  trillion dollars, every year, going forward. We could use that money to  pay for epidemics like this and fund our troops.  So, going forward, we need to talk about balancing our budget and  paying for things.    "
