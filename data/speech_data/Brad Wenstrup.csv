Brad Wenstrup,0.428019106388092,R," Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the impressive  career of my good friend, Dr. Phil Roe, who is retiring at the end of  this Congress.  A veteran himself, Dr. Roe served honorably as chairman and ranking  member on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, where he worked on  preventing veteran suicide, increasing patient access to care, and  providing agency accountability.  Dr. Roe has been a strong leader of our GOP Doctors Caucus, providing  strong insight, a steady hand, and a lot of patience as we have debated  critical legislation affecting patients and providers.  Over the years, I have been blessed enough to call Dr. Roe a dear  friend. He showed me what life in rural Tennessee was like; he has  regaled us with his guitar skills; he has made us laugh; and he has  been a source of wisdom for all of us.  It has also been a pleasure to get to know his beloved wife,  Clarinda, who I know is looking forward to having him around more  often.  I know that I can speak on behalf of all of my colleagues when I say  thank you for your service, Phil. Good luck in retirement, and God  bless you.    "
