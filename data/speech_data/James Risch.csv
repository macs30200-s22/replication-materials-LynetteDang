James Risch,0.3485189974308014,R," Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I rise today on a more somber note to pay tribute to members of the Hansen family who recently lost their lives in a tragic accident. For Jim Hansen, family is what mattered most in life. This past Thanksgiving, he was with his sons, grandsons, and great-grandson, participating in an annual hunting activity that had become a family tradition. On November 30, 2019, they were returning from this cherished family time, when a tragic plane accident took the lives of nine members of the Hansen family: Jim Hansen, Sr., Jim Hansen, Jr., Kirk Hansen, Stockton Hansen, Logan Hansen, Kyle Naylor, Tyson Dennert, Jake Hansen, and Houston Hansen. My wife Vicki and I offer our deepest condolences and our hearts go out to the remaining family members during this overwhelmingly difficult time. Their loss will not only be felt throughout their community in eastern Idaho, but also by countless others throughout the world who have been touched by their religious and philanthropic service. The miraculous survival of Josh Hansen, Matt Hansen, and Thomas Long is a tender mercy to their remaining loved ones and will hopefully bring a measure of healing for their families. Jim Hansen, Sr., spent his entire life building a legacy steeped in a strong sense of commitment to family, a touchstone to guide future generations. Being born into a family known for hard work and business acumen, as well as caring for people in need, Jim, Jr., and Kirk harnessed their entrepreneurial spirit to expand the family business into other successful ventures that had a significant impact on their home community of Idaho Falls. The success of their values and vision was manifest in the growth of their business endeavors and their global impact. Kirk and Jim were passionate about bringing hope to others, and that hope took shape in several forms. With the guidance and insight of their remarkable wives, Kirk and Jim helped found Kyani Caring Hands. For nearly a decade, this organization dedicated a significant portion of its time, energy, and financial resources to respond to disasters and support poverty-stricken [[<a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7108"">Page S7108</a>]] communities throughout the world, with a special focus on improving children's nutrition and education. The tragic plane accident that claimed the lives of these Idaho sons will forever cement the ideals and values that motivated these men to do good where good was needed. Idaho said farewell to several great men who were not only pillars of the community, but also beloved by employees everywhere. Jim Hansen, Sr., and his two sons, Kirk and Jim, Jr., were known throughout the world as men who were passionate about helping others and touching lives wherever they went. The Hansen men and children who lost their lives in this tragic plane accident will be deeply missed, but their legacy will not be forgotten.<bullet>   "
