Greg Steube,0.8313430547714233,R," Mr. STEUBE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr Speaker, let's be clear: The real threat to our democracy are the  attempts to undermine the election process.  Universal mail-in voting is not the same as absentee ballots like we  do in Florida. When a voter requests an absentee ballot, she knows to  expect it. Universal mail-in voting is when States mass mail ballots to  voters, whether or not a voter has moved, has died, or is otherwise no  longer eligible to vote or is even a citizen of our country. Universal  mail-in voting increases the risk of election crime or administrative  error because States are providing prepaid return envelopes for  election ballots.  The U.S. Postal Service does not typically postmark premarked mail,  and although it has a policy to postmark election-related mail, its  policy is not foolproof, as we have seen in some primary elections over  the summer.  All of these last-minute changes will harm the integrity of the  election process and risk chaos in the general election. We are already  seeing the disastrous results of the Democrats' last-minute process  changes.  Last week, the Justice Department found that several military ballots  were discarded in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. Seven of the nine  ballots were cast for President Trump--not surprising.  This month, the Georgia Secretary of State revealed that at least  1,000 Georgians voted twice in the June 2020 primary, once via mail-in  balloting and once in person.  In New York, Governor Cuomo's last-minute shift to all-mail voting  cost thousands of ballots in Chairwoman Maloney's primary to be  discarded for lacking postmarks. Election officials took 6 weeks to  certify the results of the primary.  In a New Jersey municipal election, a last-minute shift to all-mail  voting resulted in the Postal Service still delivering ballots to  election officials weeks after the election.  If these problems occurred in local primary elections, the risk to a  national general election is even greater. The President is right to  highlight these problems, and I fail to understand why Democrats won't.  The best and surest guarantee of electoral integrity is for Americans  to vote in person where safe and possible, with absentee ballots  available for those who legitimately cannot make it to the polls or  have voter ID safeguards in places like we have in Florida.  This resolution is nothing but political messaging and creating a  narrative without any facts to base it, just like the Russia collusion  hoax.  There is no question that every single American, including President  Trump, wants a peaceful transfer of power after a free and fair  election, but this rhetoric and fear-mongering by our friends across  the aisle must end. The liberal mainstream media and Democrats should  stop this nonsense and let the American people speak.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
