Ben McAdams,1.7404842376708984,D," Mr. McADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to say farewell to this institution  that I have been so lucky and honored to serve.  I want to first thank my wife, Julie, for supporting my career in  public service for the past 12 years and for these last 2 years while I  have been a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. It is an  understatement to say that I could not have done this job without her,  both in terms of her unconditional love and support, for taking care of  our family while I have traveled back and forth to Washington, and as a  thought partner, sounding board, strategic adviser, moral conscience,  and North Star. Any time that I was faced with a politically difficult  dilemma, she would tell me to follow my conscience and stand for what I  believe in.  I want to also thank my four children: James, Kate, Robert, and  Isaac: Your humor, love, and support have kept me going even when  things get tough. Thank you for allowing me to pursue this great  adventure, and I am looking forward to more evenings at home with the  four of you.  I also want to thank my staff. I know that I have had one of the best  staffs on Capitol Hill, and it is a testament to their hard work and  their perseverance that we were able to accomplish as much as we did.  So to Nichole, Tiffany, Alyson, Eric, Michelle, Andrea, Chris, Brennen,  Julianne, Katie, Christian, Marcus, Hannah, and Stephanie, thank you.  To the people of Utah who granted to me this opportunity, thank you.  I also thank my House colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, for your  ideas, for our constructive disagreements. For those who shared my  desire to work together to find solutions to our challenges, I am  grateful.  Mr. Speaker, I packed up my Washington, D.C., office this week with  mixed emotions: pride in the work that I accomplished to support Utah's  hardworking families, but frustrated at what did not get done. Nothing  captures it quite like the failure to deliver to date much-needed  emergency relief due to the coronavirus.  We see this catastrophe happening in Utah and around the country.  People are dying; people are sick; people are hurting economically;  small businesses are on the brink of failure, and many have already  failed. It is time for each and every one of us to step forward and to  do our part.  It is long past time for Congress to put the partisanship and  politics aside and to do its job, to get it done and to show results. A  bill that does not pass the House and Senate and get signed by the  President means nothing to struggling businesses or to a struggling  family.  The partisan divide has taken a toll on public confidence in  government's ability to meet the challenges we were elected to solve.  Americans recognize their distrust of the Federal Government and each  other is a problem that gets in the way of solving tough issues. A new  type of polarization is gripping the country.  As one researcher noted: ``This level of political divisiveness on  both sides creates a feedback loop of hatred and leaves the U.S. open  to manipulation by foreign powers that wish to further these internal  rifts.''  I have tried to counter that in my public service by walking a  centrist path: to heal and to listen where I can, to hear from all  sides, and to find common ground.  I believe it is important to elect people willing to work across the  aisle, people like me who build bridges rather than fan the flames. I  have seen this work, whether it is working with Republicans to counter  the alarming rise in the rate of suicide or traveling to our southern  border to get agreement for emergency food, housing, and medical aid  for refugees fleeing violence and danger in their home countries. Once  you learn that people in both parties agree on both humanitarian  treatment and securing the border, efforts can focus on ironing out the  details.  I was proud to represent Utah's Fourth Congressional District during  the 116th Congress, serving my community, my State, and my country as  an elected Representative in the people's House. This was a great honor  and a privilege. I am glad to have carried out their good ideas across  the finish line, including four bills expected to be signed into law.  I have built relationships with Republicans and Democrats that led to  success on clean air, stopping child trafficking, preventing suicide,  and recovering investment savings for hardworking seniors cheated by  fraudsters.  My wish this holiday season for those who serve next year in Congress  is to be less partisan and more like Utahns who see the best in each  other, who work together, roll up their sleeves, and solve problems  together for the good of everyone.  Godspeed, and may God bless the United States of America.    "
