Paul Gosar,0.948354184627533,R," Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), my friend, for organizing this Special Order  and for his leadership and expertise on forestry issues.  The events of the last month and the last decade plus show how poorly  our current forest management policies are and that they are broken and  in drastic need of reform.  Nearly every corner of the West has been touched by catastrophic  wildfire. My district has been home to several major fires this year,  including the Bush fire that burned over 193,000 acres. 700,000 acres  of land has been burned across my State.  Even before this year's fire season, the evidence of our forest  management practices being broken are clear. In the last 10 years  alone, wildfires have burned over 74 million acres of land in the West,  and our Federal Government's reaction to this has been extremely  lacking.  These catastrophic fires have devastating impacts on the environment  and human health. For example, one large wildfire is roughly the  equivalent of a major volcanic eruption, releasing large amounts of  dangerous particles into the air. This increase of air pollution  exacerbates respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19.  Because of this, earlier this year, I wrote a letter to Agriculture  Secretary Perdue and Interior Secretary Bernhardt. This letter urged  them to act quickly to secure contracts with private businesses to  ensure that firefighters could be properly protected from COVID-19 and  that the aerial support they needed to adequately fight catastrophic  fires was there.  Recent studies conducted at George Mason University showed that on  average, a fire stands a higher probability of being contained within  24 hours if air tankers are deployed on that fire within the first few  hours. Fires that do not receive air tanker support for a period of 13  hours or more are likely to take days or weeks to achieve containment.  I also wrote a letter to Attorney General Barr that urged him to  ensure that the Justice Department's Natural Resources Division was  adequately resourced to fight frivolous lawsuits from radical leftwing  environmental organizations.  Lawsuits from radical environmentalists are nothing new. We have seen  this already in Arizona with the disastrous WildEarth Guardians lawsuit  regarding the Mexican Spotted Owl. In that case, a U.S. District Court  judge in Tucson issued a ruling based on bad and debunked science that  stopped active forest management activities in six national forests,  including the Tonto National Forest in Arizona, which was the home of  the Bush fire.  This decision was a massive setback, and it is directly contributing  to the enhanced fire risk that threatens our communities that we are  seeing across the West.  A devastating wildfire season is not inevitable. It isn't something  that we must just accept. There are steps that can be taken now to  ensure that our communities are protected. [["", Page , H5635, ]  I will continue to urge the Federal agencies tasked with managing our  forests and fighting catastrophic fires that bold action is necessary.  Lives depend on it.  Just last year, as chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus, I  had the opportunity to visit the district of my friend from California,  Mr. McClintock, where aggressive forest management practices in the  Lake Tahoe Basin have prevented catastrophic fire. This active  management was made possible by getting unnecessary red tape out of the  way and putting what is most important first: protecting our  communities from the destruction of wildfire.  Just in the last 2 years, this administration has taken steps to  manage vegetation inside utility corridors, build additional  firebreaks, and reform the NEPA process within the Forest Service.  However, after so many years of inaction, there is a long road to hoe  to where we have to get, which is why I am so pleased we are here  tonight calling for serious action by this House.  There are a few pieces of legislation that have been introduced. Just  to name a few: ', H.R. 7978, ', a bipartisan, comprehensive forestry reform  bill led by the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa), as well as  ', H.R. 2607, "", the Resilient Federal Forests Act, by Mr. Westerman, both of  which I am proud to support.  The Democratic leadership in this House has been transparent about  the fact that they do not view forest management to prevent wildfires  as a legislative priority, and that has deadly consequences.  Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Arkansas for holding this  Special Order and for his leadership and expertise on this issue.    "
