Steve Stivers,0.3167714178562164,R," Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Great  American Outdoors Act.  My district has 120 projects that benefit from the Land and Water  Conservation Fund, from community parks to the Wayne National Forest,  to the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park.  Public lands, forests, and parks give folks the opportunity to  connect with the outdoors and with each other, especially in this time  of the coronavirus.  I also represent a bunch of small businesses, like Rocky Boots in  Nelsonville that employs 2,800 people and depends on a thriving outdoor  recreation economy.  In my district last year, $1.37 billion was spent on outdoor  recreation. And at a time when there is such a backlog in maintenance,  this maintenance support will create 100,000 jobs.  During a time when we have 11.1 percent unemployment, Congress should  be taking every opportunity it can to create jobs.  Mr. Speaker, this bill isn't just about conservation, it is about  jobs and the economy, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''  It is a Senate bill that passed the Senate 73-25. It is not perfect,  but it is a good bill, and it is a bill we should support.    "
