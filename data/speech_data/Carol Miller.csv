Carol Miller,0.3584381341934204,R," Mrs. MILLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Chuck Yeager. [[', Page , H7243, ]  Mr. Yeager was a war hero, an incredible pilot, and a great West  Virginian.  Born in Lincoln County in the small town of Myra, Chuck was a stellar  athlete and a bright student who enlisted in the Air Force during World  War II, answering the call to serve.  As a pilot, he was known for his outstanding leadership and flying  skills, and his incredible vision. I am also proud to say that he never  lost his steadfast West Virginia spirit.  Flying over 61 missions as an ace, he returned home from the war in  1945. He then became a test pilot who researched high-speed flight.  In 1947, Chuck was the first person to break the sound barrier,  flying over the Mojave Desert, and went on to accomplish more in the  field of flight while serving in the Air Force until 1971.  He was one of America's greatest pilots.  Chuck passed away this month at the age of 97. He lived a life of  adventure, patriotism, service, and strength. He will always be  remembered.    "
