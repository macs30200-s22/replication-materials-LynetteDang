Andre Carson,0.1591608226299286,D," Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Tri-Caucus' Special Order to highlight the disproportionate impact of  COVID-19 on communities of color. Our nation is currently overwhelmed  by unprecedented numbers of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and  deaths. After more than eight months of suffering, the COVID-19  pandemic continues to ravage our communities, creating incalculable  pain, massive economic disruption, and immense strain on our public  health system. As of this moment, more than 246,000 Americans have lost  their lives from this deadly disease. More than eleven million have  been infected, and nearly 70,000 are currently hospitalized with severe  cases of COVID-19. While all Americans are suffering from this  pandemic, communities of color are experiencing acute and  disproportionate pain.  From the beginning of this pandemic, it was clear that the phrase  ``when white America catches a cold, Black America gets pneumonia''  would be particularly true with COVID-19's devastating consequences. In  fact, the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately harms Black and Brown  communities with dramatically unequal infection rates,  hospitalizations, and deaths. Specifically, Black people are three  times more likely to become infected with COVID-19 than whites.  Moreover, Black people die from COVID-19 at around twice the rate of  white people. These aren't just statistics. They represent our friends,  neighbors, and loved ones. They are people like my cousin who died from  COVID-19 earlier this year, and so many others who are no longer with  us.  Like past disease outbreaks and natural disasters, the COVID-19  pandemic lays bare the consequences of systemic injustices suffered by  communities of color. Institutional racism, compounded by environmental  and economic injustices, have resulted in severe health disparities for  communities of color which make the COVID-19 pandemic so uniquely  devastating. Despite the disproportionate harm the COVID-19 pandemic  has caused among communities of color, many states still do not provide  transparency regarding racial and ethnic demographic data for COVID-19  cases and deaths. For example, in my state of Indiana, the State only  provides an aggregate breakdown of the racial and ethnic demographics  for cases and deaths during the entire pandemic. This results in a  profoundly incomplete picture of the disproportionate sickness, death,  fear and tragedy this virus is inflicting on communities of color.  As Congress considers much-needed, additional measures to combat  COVID-19 and provide relief for businesses, hospitals and workers, one  thing is clear: Communities of color must receive substantial relief  and support that matches the devastation they've suffered from this  pandemic. In addition, states and public health departments must  provide updated and daily demographic information, including a racial  and ethnic breakdown, for the daily numbers of COVID-19 cases and  deaths. This data transparency is essential to fully understand how the  pandemic is affecting different communities and how we can best  respond. With this data, we can better target our COVID-19 relief funds  and support to ensure that communities of color get all the help we  need to weather the storm of this pandemic and combat the underlying  inequities in our health care system that this pandemic has  exacerbated.  I am committed to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to act now and to act boldly to implement a national plan that will  save lives from this terrible disease.    "
