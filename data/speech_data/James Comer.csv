James Comer,0.2670707404613495,R," Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk about the ongoing  investigation within the House Committee on Oversight and Reform among  oversight Republicans.  The minority--the Republicans--have requested several hearings, but  unfortunately, Chairwoman Maloney and the majority House Democrats are  uninterested or unwilling to comply. So we have taken it upon ourselves  to inquire and pretty much open up investigations with our staff, with  our investigators, and have taken data from our whistleblowers and  different stakeholders with each investigation.  We currently have caught a situation before the election, in  California, where--with the CARES Act--there was a part called the Help  America Vote Act that allocated funds for different States to educate  voters on how to vote. In other words, to educate voters on where their  precincts are and how to fill out an absentee ballot--things that are  perfectly legal and things that the Federal Government should fund, and  the State government should administer.  Mr. Speaker, within the rules--something that a lot of times my  friends on the other side of the aisle don't think apply to  themselves--but in the rules of the Help America Vote Act, it  specifically says what those Federal funds can and cannot be used for.  One of the things that it specifically says the Federal funds cannot be  used for is to get out the vote efforts.  But in California, which was awarded $35 million in the CARES Act of  Help America Vote Act funds, their Secretary of State Padilla took the  $35 million. The normal process would be to advertise bids for a  contract, but Secretary Padilla did what a lot of Democrat secretaries  of state--and unfortunately, some Republican secretaries of state did-- they said, Oh, there is a pandemic. We can't do this the normal way. We  have to do it a special way.  So he awarded this contract with no bid. There were plenty of vendors  that were interested in bidding on that contract but he awarded it to  one. And in the Help America Vote Act it specifically says that vendors  can't be partisan. That is common sense, right?  This contract that he awarded, a $35 million of our Federal taxpayer  funds in a no-bid process, the firm that received that contract was  called SKDKnickerbocker. I invite you right now to get your phone out  and put in ``SKDKnickerbocker,'' and look at their website.  It will pop up, and what you will see is a picture of Joe Biden and  Kamala Harris shaking hands. And it proudly says--on the very top of  the website--``We want to congratulate our clients, Joe Biden and  Kamala Harris, for changing America, and for winning.'' So this firm,  SKDKnickerbocker was clearly a partisan firm. This firm represented the  Biden campaign.  Now, my question to anyone interested in this--and I think most  taxpayers would be interested in this--obviously, the House Democrats  on the [["", Page , H6887, ] Committee on Oversight and Reform are uninterested in this, but if the  secretary of state awards a no-bid contract to a Joe Biden partisan  firm to get out to vote, do you really think they are going to target  Republican voters, or do you think they are going to target Democrat  voters? That is illegal.  Mr. Speaker, we have sent letters to Secretary Padilla asking him  what his intentions were and why he did not follow the law on this  contract. He has not replied. I have made this public. I went on the  Tucker Carlson Show a few months ago and brought this to the Nation's  attention. As a result of this, and our messaging and our inquiries,  the media in California has been writing about this.  The Sacramento Bee wrote just this past week that the California  comptroller has refused to pay the $35 million bill to SKDKnickerbocker  because they know there is a problem with this no-bid contract awarded  to a partisan firm that was Joe Biden's main digital firm to  microtarget certain voters in California.  Mr. Speaker, what I am asking for now is for the comptroller of  California to just go ahead and do the right thing and send that $35  million back to the Treasury. We don't want taxpayer dollars being  spent on improper, illegal, unethical, and partisan instances. And that  is what happened in California.  Now, another reason this isn't going to go away--I am not an expert  on California politics--but while I was waiting for my time to speak, I  read several things that said Secretary of State Padilla is the  frontrunner to fill Kamala Harris' seat for the U.S. Senate. I strongly  encourage the secretary of state to answer House Republicans' inquiries  on this issue, because if he doesn't answer it now and he does, in  fact, get confirmed to the U.S. Senate, he is probably going to have to  answer it in front of the Senate Committee on Ethics.  Now, one thing that I pledged to do when I became ranking member of  the House Committee on Oversight and Reform is, we weren't just going  to identify problems. We were going to try to represent the taxpayers,  and we weren't just going to identify instances of waste, fraud and  abuse, like this $35 million no-bid contract in California. We were  going to try to claw back that money--get the money back. It seems like  forever in Congress, Members of Congress do the right thing and they  identify wrongful spending, but nothing ever happens. No one is ever  held accountable. Certainly, the taxpayers never get their money back.  This is an instance we are not going to let up.  Mr. Speaker, we are operating in a huge deficit. We have to be  accountable for the taxpayers. That is the job of this Congress. The  Committee on Oversight and Reform is serious. The Republicans on the  Committee on Oversight and Reform are going in a new direction. Not  only are we going to identify problems, but we are going to try to  solve problems because we are going to get the backs of the American  taxpayer.  And I think I have clearly spelled out the problems with this  contract. And I believe that the fact that the comptroller in  California isn't willing to write that check for the bill, that proves  that there was a problem there. If anything I have said today is  incorrect, then I welcome Secretary Padilla to answer our inquiry. And  if anything I have said that was not right, I will apologize to the  secretary of state for that. But clearly, sitting there not responding,  is not helping the situation and, again, it is not going to go away.  Mr. Speaker, now another thing with this contract, I have spelled out  the problem that the State of California, the secretary of state has  with this $35 million no-bid contract. The next part of the problem  with this particular investigation is our committee has sent numerous  letters to a government agency that a lot of people probably never  heard of, called the Election Assistance Commission.  The Election Assistance Commission is a government agency,  bureaucracy, entity--whatever you want to call it--that is supposed to  be the watchdog for Federal funding pertaining to elections. They have  an inspector general. I have written--and on those letters, they were  signed by my colleague on the Committee on Oversight and Reform, Jody  Hice of Georgia, and the ranking member of the House Administration  Committee, Rodney Davis of Illinois--we have jointly written letters to  the Inspector General of the Election Assistance Commission for the  Inspector General to investigate this $35 million contract. We wrote  these letters weeks in advance of the November elections. And we have  gotten back form letters, kind of like form letters that we send out to  people that call our office every day and ask for things that we are  probably not going to be able to do. We always reply with nice form  letters. That is what the ranking members of the House Committee on  Oversight and Reform and the House Administration Committee got.  If the Election Assistance Commission can't investigate this one  thing in this election--and I am not even going to get into a debate  today about whether there were irregularities or not. That is not what  I am discussing today. I am discussing a specific irregularity that  involved taxpayer dollars.  {time} 1615  If the Election Assistance Commission inspector general cannot  investigate that and come up with an answer and say, ``Okay, the  Secretary the State was right,'' or, ``Okay, you were right, and the  money should be returned,'' if they can't get us an answer on that,  then the next step we are going to suggest, as Republican members of  the Committee on Oversight and Reform, will be to eliminate the  Election Assistance Commission.  If you can't take an inquiry from Congress and investigate it,  especially when the media in California--not exactly a bastion of  Republican support--when they are calling the Secretary of State out on  this contract, then I think we have a problem with this government  agency.  Government is too big. I have been in Washington 4 years now. There  are a lot of buildings in this city with a lot of government employees,  a lot of government programs. Honestly, in my opinion, we don't have  the ability to continue to fund all of these government programs, all  of these government agencies, and all of these government employees. If  we can find government agencies that refuse to do their jobs, then we  should eliminate those government agencies.  So, my remarks today are specifically about the contract in  California with the Secretary of State, the contract for the Help  America Vote Act, which was in the CARES Act, which was a no-bid  contract to a partisan firm to do illegal things, like microtarget  voters. That is my first complaint, the $35 million.  My second complaint is the Election Assistance Commission. With the  one request that we made, I have been very unimpressed, disappointed,  shocked, to the point now I am angered. Now, as a taxpayer and someone  who wants to get the back of the taxpayer, I think it is time to look  at this agency and say: Is this something that we need moving forward?  Mr. Speaker, I am going to conclude my remarks, again, with reference  to the Committee on Oversight and Reform. As a member of the committee  for the past 4 years, I have heard a lot of Democrats complain about  the 2016 election, imply that there were irregularities in the  election. I have heard my friend Debbie Wasserman Schultz complain,  probably rightfully so, about the emails being hacked at the Democratic  National Committee. We have had discussions about that.  I know that when Elijah Cummings became chairman of the committee,  the first witness he had was Michael Cohen to talk about irregularities  in the 2016 election that he saw from the Trump campaign and things  like that. We had those committee hearings, and we have had a lot of  those committee hearings.  Here we are today, several weeks after the Presidential election.  Regardless of your opinion of the election, regardless of your opinion  of the rightful winner, regardless of your opinion of whether there  were major irregularities or not, there are a lot of Americans who have  a lot of questions about the election process.  There were a lot of things in this election that were unique, not  just the absentee voting process where the rules were changed in the  middle of the game, but also the number of people who voted by mail and  voted absentee. [["", Page , H6888, ]  I feel like the American people deserve one committee in this Chamber  to step up and hold a hearing and hear both sides. If I were Chairwoman  Maloney or Jamie Raskin or Gerry Connolly or Mr. Clay, or anybody on  the committee who hears this request, if I believed there weren't any  irregularities, I would want to have a hearing to make the Republicans  look bad. I am disappointed that we are not doing our job in the  Committee on Oversight and Reform.  But with the specific investigation that Republicans have done in  California, without any help from the Democrats--we don't need their  help. We don't need their help on this. We have already proven it. The  comptroller in California knows it. We are now asking to send the money  back.  If you are not going to explain, Secretary Padilla, if you don't want  to talk about it, that is fine. Send the money back, and taxpayers will  move on.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
