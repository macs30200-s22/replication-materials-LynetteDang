Adam Kinzinger,0.8415959477424622,R," Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this to the  floor.  When we think about Russian prisons, we don't often think about  justice because, frankly, justice is at the whim of Vladimir Putin, the  man who poisons citizens on NATO territory and uses the bludgeon of a  hammer to actually get his will and power.  So sometimes I think when we as Americans look at our political  debates, we look at it as a form of dysfunction when, in reality, while  the debate can be dysfunctional, it is very functional that we are  having them.  But in this case, I think it needs to be clear that we stand up for  American citizens no matter what, and we don't care what their  political stripes are when they are detained by somebody like Vladimir  Putin.  This resolution calls for the immediate release of Trevor Reed. He is  a U.S. citizen, he is a Marine Corps veteran, and he was unjustly  sentenced to 9 years in a Russian prison.  He has been detained for over a year now on baseless charges filed  through an overtly corrupt trial.  His lawyers have been denied access to the so-called evidence that  the Russian authorities used to detain Trevor.  After speaking with his mother, I have learned that his family has  had a difficult time talking to him on the phone, limited interaction,  because the authorities will not let Trevor communicate in English and  they give him only a few calls home.  It is an abuse of power and it is a clear attempt by the Russians to  make an example of Trevor, an American, and this must be rectified  immediately.  Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleagues for bringing up this important  measure to the floor today.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Conaway and I thank the chair and ranking  member. I thank Chairman Engel for his many, many years of service as  well on the committee and in this House.    "
