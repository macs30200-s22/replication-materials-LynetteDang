Joe Neguse,3.5085272789001465,D," Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Huffman for his  leadership.  I am proud to speak in support of two of my bills being considered  today, ', H.R. 5458, ' and ', H.R. 5459, '. As you have heard, these bipartisan  bills would extend Rocky Mountain National Park and ultimately create  more opportunities for Coloradans and visitors to our State to enjoy  outdoor activities.  ', H.R. 5458, "", the bill before the House right now, the Rocky Mountain  National Park Boundary Modification Act, as has been articulated  previously, would formally codify a generous donation into the park  boundary made by former astronaut and Longmont, Colorado, native, Vance  Brand.  Mr. Brand bravely served our country in the Armed Forces and then  served as an astronaut, and he has now so generously agreed to donate  roughly 40 acres to Rocky Mountain National Park. This expansion would  add additional protections for the park's high elevation ecosystem and  provide recreational access to literally hundreds of miles of trails.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have introduced both of these legislative  proposals, which came at the request of local communities that I have  the honor of representing back in Colorado and that ultimately seek to  protect the public lands that they love. The bills enjoy the support  from the town of Estes Park, Larimer County, and the Rocky Mountain  Conservancy.  As one of the Nation's most historic parks, Rocky Mountain National  Park remains one of the top-visited public lands in our country,  attracting over 4.6 million people, annually, in recent years. Given  the park's breathtaking scenery and iconic significance, these numbers  are only anticipated to rise.  I know my good friend from the Fifth Congressional District of  Colorado, Representative Lamborn, knows Rocky Mountain National Park  well. I am sure, like me, he and his family have had countless  opportunities to enjoy the park and its breathtaking scenery.  It is an honor to be able to represent Rocky Mountain National Park  here in the United States Congress.  People from all over the world are drawn to the park, each for their  own reasons, to experience nature, seek solitude, watch wildlife, and  partake in outstanding recreational activities. I, myself, hold a  number of treasured memories growing up in Colorado and enjoying Rocky  Mountain National Park: hikes with my father and now being able to take  my daughter on those same trails. It is something that holds deep  meaning for many Americans, and especially for Coloradans.  As we collectively seek healing during and after the COVID-19  pandemic, our public lands offer both a mental and physical refuge as  well as an economic stimulus for the local communities that rely on  them.  Additionally--and this bears mentioning--this year, devastating  wildfires have occurred across Colorado, forcing evacuations,  threatening air and water quality, and destroying homes and businesses.  Three of the State's five largest fires in the history of Colorado  occurred in 2020.  While the bulk of these fires were on lands surrounding Rocky  Mountain National Park, nearly 30,000 acres burned within the park's  boundary. When the East Troublesome fire grew over 100,000 acres in 1  day and swept through a portion of the park, a number of park  structures were lost.  Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to thank the  superintendent of the Rocky Mountain National Park and her wonderful  rangers and all of the personnel at Rocky Mountain National Park who  work tirelessly to protect the park and the communities that surround  it.  Given the devastating nature of these wildfires, in addition to the  COVID-19 pandemic, fulfilling the requests of local Colorado  communities that have been impacted by, not one, but two, historic  disasters is an even greater imperative.  Mr. Speaker, for that reason, I respectfully urge my colleagues to  support both "", H.R. 5458, ' and ', H.R. 5459, "", bipartisan bills that will  protect our treasured public lands.    "
