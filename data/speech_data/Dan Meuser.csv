Dan Meuser,0.0497006773948669,R," Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the PIAA on  seeing through a successful fall season for Pennsylvania high school  sports in spite of the many challenges.  We have some great sports teams in my district of Pennsylvania, and I  would like to highlight a few.  North Schuylkill's Spartans won a well-deserved football district  championship at the conclusion of an undefeated season.  Palmyra's high school girls field hockey team won a State title in  overtime, their first in 15 years; Southern Columbia girls soccer won  their second title in 3 years; and Bloomsburg girls soccer won their  State title.  Mr. Speaker, Southern Columbia's high school football program is  nothing short of awesome. Southern Columbia, under Coach Jim Roth, won  their 11th State title. On both sides of the ball, this team dominates,  and the Tigers have made their citizens of Columbia County and all of  Pennsylvania very proud.  And congratulations to Lake Lehman football. I have known many of the  players on this great team since they were 6 years old, playing and  learning the game under Back Mountain Bobcats Head Coach Dan Anderson  and other great coaches.  Lake Lehman's coach, Jerry Gilsky, led the Black Knights to a great  season. They came up short in the district championship game, but they  had a season of champions, and we are proud of them.
