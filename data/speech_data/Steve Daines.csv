Steve Daines,1.1340919733047483,R," Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week I have the honor of recognizing Charlotte Kinnoman of Lake County for her dedication to Montana's first responders during Christmas. When Charlotte met a law enforcement officer at an event with her family, she learned of the sacrifices our first responders make to protect Montana's families and communities. After that meeting, and at just 12 years old, Charlotte decided she wanted to give back to our first responders. She has been writing 125 Christmas cards a day to give to every first responder she meets. She even has a goal of writing 12,000 total. Charlotte's mom and classmates have also been helpful in writing Christmas cards to make sure they are spreading holiday cheer all across Big Sky Country. I commend Charlotte for her compassion. Charlotte is a great role model for all young Montanans, and I thank her for supporting our first responders this Christmas season.<bullet>   "
