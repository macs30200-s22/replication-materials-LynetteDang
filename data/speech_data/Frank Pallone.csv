Frank Pallone,4.582678318023682,D," Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  I rise in strong support of this final omnibus package that includes  critical legislation from the Energy and Commerce Committee.  First, this agreement includes $69 billion to crush the coronavirus  by supporting the rapid and equitable distribution of COVID-19  vaccines, as well as critical testing and contact tracing.  Second, this package finally ends surprise medical bills for American  consumers. These surprise bills have burdened millions of patients with  crushing medical debts. It saves money, which pays for a 3-year  extension to fund community health centers and other vital healthcare  programs.  Third, the bill phases down HFCs. This is a big win in the fight  against climate change, along with the reauthorization of the Pipeline  Safety Act, which reduces methane leaks.  And, fourth, we provide major assistance for struggling families to  better afford their internet service.  These are just a few of the key provisions from the Energy and  Commerce Committee.  But I want to end by thanking the chair, Nita Lowey. As she  mentioned, she and Eliot Engel, myself, and Rich Neal are the last in  our class. I hate to say it that way. She has been an outstanding  legislator and a great friend. My only regret is that she is going to  just leave Richie Neal and myself to carry on here. So I really wish  she would not leave, but I know she wants to, and I wish her the best.  I love you, Nita.    "
