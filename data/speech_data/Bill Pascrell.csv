Bill Pascrell,1.7472840547561646,D," Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the chairman. I know he has  worked hard on this for many moons, and he deserves it. He earned it.  Mr. Speaker, 64 years ago this week, Dwight Eisenhower signed into  law the Interstate Highway System. The roads, the bridges, the highways  of that system connected Americans and communities together like never  before. It is no stretch that the landmark legislation remade the  United States for a new postwar era, a great measure for the homeland's  security. That is how he put it.  Today, we are implementing the aspirations in the Green New Deal by  passing our own blueprint for the next century. It includes bridges,  roads, new trains, buses, new water pipelines in housing. This plan  invests in electric, solar, water, geothermal, and wind power.  It includes my own Offshore Wind Power bill that will create clean  energy jobs and invest in renewable sources of energy, because the  future can't just be bold and big; it must be clean, too.  "", H.R. 2, "" is a down payment on an America for our children and our  grandchildren because a living, breathing great Nation invests in its  future. Today, we are doing exactly that.  Mr. Speaker, I have been here for 25 years. We have always had 5-year  plans for infrastructure, and we are back maybe to normality now,  thanks in great part to our chairman.    "
