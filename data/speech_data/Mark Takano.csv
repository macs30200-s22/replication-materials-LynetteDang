Mark Takano,4.513885498046875,D," Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a dear  mentor, an honorable public servant, and a stalwart leader in the  Japanese-American community, Rose Ochi.  Rose was one of my mentors when I was in my twenties and thirties.  Her guidance and her wisdom helped me during those formative years. I  know that I was not the only person whose life she touched. She blazed  a trail for many others in our community besides me.  Rose was a justice seeker and served as an Associate Attorney General  of the United States under President Clinton, as the criminal justice  planning director for Mayor Tom Bradley, and as a fighter for redress  for the Japanese-American community who suffered through internment.  Her work contributed to making America a more perfect Union.  Madam Speaker, we will miss Rose's towering presence and grace, but  her legacy will live on.    "
