Brian Mast,0.8645675182342529,R," Mr. MAST. ``Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called  children of God.''  Madam Speaker, I rise today because the life and sacrifice of a true  peacemaker, Trooper Joseph Bullock, will be honored by our passing of  legislation to rename the postal facility in Port Salerno, Florida, as  the Joseph Bullock Post Office Building.  Though he knew the risk, his story is not how a watch should end. And  as we see his name each day in Port Salerno, we will be reminded of the  valor within all of our law enforcement who, each day, commit to our  communities the most significant thing that they have: their life.  Trooper Bullock, we salute you.    "
