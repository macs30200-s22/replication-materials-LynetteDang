Richard Durbin,0.6252800226211548,D," Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we find ourselves in the usual December  doldrums. We are somewhere between the end of the baseball season and  the beginning of spring training. It is a time to reflect and a time to  dream.  A familiar offseason refrain from many die-hard Chicago Cubs fans is,  ``Wait `til next year'' or ``next season will be different.'' Well,  next season will indeed be different as Cubs fans will not, in the  immortal words of Steve Goodman, be able to ``catch it all on WGN.''  Chicago Cubs baseball is moving to the new Marquee Sports Network. I  want to take a moment to honor WGN's long-standing commitment to  unsurpassed sports coverage and their historic partnership with the  Cubs.  I think it is safe to say that, for the most part, Cubs fans are an  optimistic bunch. We have endured some very tough seasons and the  longest championship drought in Major League Baseball. Of course, in  2016, the Cubs rewarded their fans with a World Series championship,  the first in more than a century. Throughout much of that century, fans  could count on watching their favorite team on ``Chicago's Very Own,''  WGN-TV. In fact, for 72 years, WGN helped spread the thrills of Cubs  baseball through player milestones, including Mr. Cub Ernie Banks'  500th homerun, pennant races, October baseball, and more than a few  lean years.  The Cubs game on April 23, 1948, wasn't a particularly memorable one.  They lost 1-0 to the rival St. Louis Cardinals. History was made not on  the field but in the broadcast booth as WGN-TV aired its first Cubs  game and set in motion the longest baseball-TV relationship in baseball  history. Since then, WGN-TV has aired 7,115 Cubs games, reaching fans  across the country and around the globe.  It was a great risk for the Cubs to start airing all their games on  television. What if people stopped going to games and only watched from  home? After all, WGN-TV made it feel like you were at the game. The  Zoomar lens brought long shots and close-ups into focus as a television  cameraman swung quickly from views of the whole diamond to close-ups of  batting, pitching, and action in the bullpen. But the gamble was worth  it. The Cubs drew 1.2 million fans to Wrigley Field in 1948, despite  losing 90 games that season.  It became a tradition for kids to come home after school to watch the  Cubs on WGN. Hall of famers Ernie Banks, Billy Williams, Ron Santo, [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7195"">Page S7195</a>, ] Fergie Jenkins, Andre Dawson, Ryne Sandberg, and a host of Cubs stars  became household names to fans across the country. Many a big leaguer  today will tell stories about watching the Cubs on WGN-TV and dreaming  of playing at Wrigley Field.  Generations of fans grew up knowing the sights and sounds of WGN-TV's  Jack Brickhouse yelling, ``Hey-hey!'' or Harry Caray's ``Holy cow!''  and his famous rendition of ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game.'' Both of  these hall of famers informed, entertained, and thrilled us for decades  with their play-by-play. They dazzled in the booth even when the action  on the field fell a bit short. WGN legendary producer/director Arne  Harris was behind the scenes from the 1960s through 2001, bringing us  baseball history from Wrigley Field. A distinguished list of announcers  also graced the WGN-TV broadcast booth including Milo Hamilton, Lou  Boudreau, Vince Lloyd, and Lloyd Pettit. Today, Len Kasper and Jim  Deshaies faithfully continue that tradition and are our trusted guides  to Cubs baseball. They will continue, along with WGN-TV director of  production and author Bob Vorwald, on the new network in 2020.  I want to take this opportunity to thank WGN-TV president general  manager Paul Rennie and all the good people at WGN who brought us the  sights and sounds of the Cubs and the Friendly Confines for 72 years.  In addition to those already mentioned, we acknowledge longtime  sports editor Jack Rosenberg, who routinely pulled off the impossible  in support of the telecast; directors Chris Erskine, Jack Jacobson,  Bill Lotzer, Skip Ellison, and Marc Brady; and videographer Joe  Pausback. My friend, Shaun Sheehan, was WGN's ambassador to Washington  and to the Congress for nearly three decades. And countless assistant  directors, technical directors, camera operators, audio engineers,  video shaders, and sales, business, and station executives, including  Jim Tianis, Frank Leone, Mike Aiello, Scott Jones, Steve Casey, Mike  Clay, Mark Stencel, Marty Wilke, Errol Gerber, Marissa Rudman, Jake  Fendley, Mark Boe, Jeff Shaw, Ward Quaal, Joe Loughlin, Dennis  FitzSimons, Peter Walker, John Vitanovec, Tom Ehlmann, Greg Easterly,  Jim Dowdle, Sheldon Cooper, Jim Zerwekh, Bob Ramsey, Tom Boyd, and  Terry ``Whitey'' Pearson truly made Cubs baseball on WGN-TV special.  As Bob Vorwald said just before the final games on WGN, ``We want to  tip our hat to Jack Brickhouse and Harry Caray and all the people that  have announced and the thousands of men and women that have worked on  the games. But, the best way to do that is by having a great telecast.  That's always been our mission, and it's important that we uphold that  to the very end.''  As WGN-TV and all the people who made Chicago Cubs baseball telecasts  possible sign off, let me join the countless fans in thanking them for  creating an American standard of broadcasting excellence.
