Fred Keller,0.233557641506195,R," Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of "", S. 3989, "", the United States  Semiquincentennial Commission Amendments Act.  Our country's Declaration of Independence was courageously signed in  1776. This makes 2026 the 250th anniversary our great Republic and its  founding.  An exposition marking the 150th anniversary was in Philadelphia in  1926, and bicentennial celebrations were held throughout the country in  1976. It is only fitting that we also celebrate the 250th anniversary,  another milestone anniversary.  To do this, Congress passed and the President signed the United  States Semiquincentennial Commission Act of 2016 in the 114th Congress.  The bill before us today would amend the law authorizing the  Commission, with necessary changes, to allow the planning work to  continue. "", S. 3989, "" grants the Commission certain flexibilities, such as  no longer requiring every meeting convene at Independence Hall in  Philadelphia. The law would still recognize Philadelphia's importance  and requires at least one meeting per year to be held in the City of  Brotherly Love.  This bill, "", S. 3989, ', would add the directors of several Federal  agencies focused [[', Page , H7245, ] on the arts to assist with the planning. The bill would also grant the  Commission exclusive rights over their official logo for commercial  licensing purposes, which would help provide additional funding  resources for the Commission's work. These changes will allow the  Commission and the rest of the United States to better celebrate our  country's 250th anniversary.  Madam Speaker, as the Commission noted in their 2020 report to the  President, ``America 250,'' the central theme of the celebrations, will  be ``educate, engage, and unite.'' Specifically, the Commission's  primary goal with these celebrations is to inspire the American spirit;  to deepen the understanding of our history and the democratic process  through education; increase engagement in our communities and governing  affairs; and foster unity, that includes the many Americans in our  ``one Nation.''  Madam Speaker, I think my colleagues would agree that more than ever,  Americans stand to benefit from a national celebration reflecting on  our shared values which unite us as a country, a country uniquely  founded on a set of ideals.  Every one of us owes a debt of gratitude to the framework of  freedoms, rights, and government institutions our Founding Fathers  established with such a discerning forethought. We look forward to the  Commission's plans being finalized next year and for the forthcoming  celebrations of America's founding, a country we all love so well.  Madam Speaker, we look forward to celebrating the 250th anniversary  of America's founding. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    "
