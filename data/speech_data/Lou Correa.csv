Lou Correa,1.2189539670944214,D," Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for leading. I thank  Chairman Nadler for his leadership in this issue and thank him, also,  for including my amendment that calls for a study of cannabis as an  alternative medicine for our veterans.  More than half of all Americans live in a State where cannabis is  legal. Let's align Federal cannabis laws with the will of the people.  And let's take full advantage of the medical benefits of cannabis. We  know that medical cannabis is good for treating things such as  seizures, glaucoma, chronic pain, and PTSD, and veterans prefer  cannabis over opioids.  Let me repeat. Veterans prefer cannabis over opioids to treat the  invisible wounds that they bring back from the battlefield.  Other nations, like Israel, export cannabis products. Let's unleash  America's free enterprise system to take full advantage of the  commercial benefits of cannabis.  Let's get busy and do the will of the people. Let's pass the MORE  Act.
