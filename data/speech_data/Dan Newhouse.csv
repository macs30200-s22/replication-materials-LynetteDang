Dan Newhouse,0.2419601380825042,R," Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, on behalf of the ranking member, I would  just like to say that we support this legislation. We certainly  appreciate our friend, Mr. Lujan, for bringing it forward.  Just a few comments I would like to make, rising in support of "", H.R. 3682, "". This bill seeks to ensure better consultation and collaboration  between our Federal land management agencies and local stakeholders  over management of New Mexico's land grants and acequias.  "", H.R. 3682, ' requires coordination between the Department of  Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, and land grant-mercedes.  These are the governing bodies of certain community land grants made by  Spain or Mexico in the 17th to the mid-19th centuries to individuals,  groups, and communities to promote the settlement of the southwestern  United States.  Specifically, this bill directs Federal land management agencies to  make these bodies aware of changes to management plans and other  Federal actions affecting their land grants. ', H.R. 3682, "" also requires  the Federal Government to issue guidance on permitting and permissible  uses.  Finally, this bill creates a process for New Mexico's land grant- mercedes to establish their historical boundaries and provides a  pathway for acquiring Federal land that falls within those boundaries  when the Federal Government disposes of it.  We should always strive to make sure that the Federal Government is a  good neighbor to the communities most impacted by its land management  decisions, and this good bill does exactly that. It empowers rural  communities in New Mexico with a greater say over land management  decisions impacting their historically important common lands which  will, in turn, ensure continued community care and use for generations  to come.  So I support this legislation. I thank the gentleman very much for  bringing it forward, and I yield back the balance of my time.    "
