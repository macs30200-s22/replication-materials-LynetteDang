Suzanne Bonamici,1.9157012701034544,D," Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Consolidated  Appropriations Act, which includes my bipartisan Water Power Research  and Development Act.  As we work to mitigate the climate crisis and transition to a 100  percent clean energy economy, we cannot ignore our ocean. It covers  more than 70 percent of the surface of our planet, and we can capture  the power of its waves, currents, and tides to power our homes,  buildings, and communities.  Marine energy has tremendous potential as one of the last untapped  renewable energy sources, and federal investment can help unlock it.  Earlier this year, I was pleased to work with my House Oceans Caucus  CoChair, Congressman Don Young, and another marine energy enthusiast  from the east coast, Congressman Ted Deutch, to introduce the  bipartisan Water Power Research and Development Act. The bill would  reauthorize funding for research, development, demonstration, and  commercialization of marine energy within the Department of Energy's  Water Power Technologies Office. Importantly, the bill authorizes  funding for existing and new National Marine Energy Centers, including  the Pacific Marine Energy Center--operated by Oregon State University,  the University of Washington, and the University of Alaska Fairbanks.  Researchers at Oregon State University are leading the way on this  innovative work. Through the Pacific Marine Energy Center, OSU is  currently in the process of developing PacWave, the first of its kind  wave energy test facility off the Oregon Coast. Their leadership  scaling up the PacWave testing facility will catalyze this nascent  industry. Additionally, we are fortunate to have the advanced  manufacturing capacity of companies like Vigor, which recently  constructed an 826-ton wave energy device that was deployed off the  shores of Hawaii. It was not until I visited Vigor to see the device  that I grasped the scale of this resource and what we can gain from it.  I appreciate the support of Chairwoman Johnson in helping to secure  the inclusion of the Water Power Research and Development Act in  today's comprehensive energy package and end of year spending bill, and  I am thrilled that it will soon be signed into law. I urge all of my  colleagues to support this bill, which is an important step forward in  advancing ocean climate action.    "
