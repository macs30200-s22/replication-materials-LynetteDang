Louie Gohmert,0.1093414947390556,R," Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my Aggie friend and appreciate that  shout-out to what sounds like an incredible lady.  Mr. Speaker, my friend will be missed here in Congress. We have had  some disagreements, but I know his heart and I know he has always  wanted what is best for the country. And I greatly appreciate that  heart.  Mr. Speaker, perhaps I should have gotten more than two hours sleep  last night. I was thinking ``Jaime Beutler Herrera'' but it didn't  sound right. It is Jaime Herrera Beutler.  Mr. Speaker, she has a discharge petition, and I hope that if there  is any Republican that has not signed onto Jaime's discharge petition  that they will come do that as soon as possible. We need to get that  money. It has already been appropriated. It is just sitting there. Why  could we not agree on that?  I know that Ms. Herrera Beutler, I know Mr. Chabot, they would be  fine if [["", Page , H7142, ] the Democrats put somebody else's name on what they have done. That is  fine. Put Democrat names on it, but let's get it done. We are more  concerned about helping people that need the money after having their  businesses shut down, curtailed, cut back. Let's get that money to  them, and I hope that we will.  With regard to this election, on the one hand, you have got COVID  that is killing people. On the other hand, you have fraud that is  killing a nation. And we know it is serious because YouTube did  everything they could--as did Google and Twitter--to censor the public  dialogue about different types of fraud, investigations into the Biden  family. They did everything they could to hurt President Trump and to  help candidate Biden.  Now we see today, YouTube is going to start preventing any discussion  about fraud. So we know it is serious when YouTube has to take the  position as the totalitarian censor--basically, fascist censor, that  the high-tech industry has chosen to be--that they are going to  eliminate anybody's ability using their public forum to discuss the  facts of fraud.  And for those networks that say that they are unfounded, they need to  pull their heads out of the orifice, hole in the ground, whatever, in  which their heads are stuck because there have been hundreds and  hundreds of affidavits. There are thousands of examples of fraud in the  elections.  And as John Fund said, the biggest fraud about elections is the  statement ``there is no fraud in elections.'' It is not new. It has  just never, ever, anywhere in the history of the world, been utilized  in so many ways and with so many ballots as it has been in this  election.  {time} 1315  We have seen the gutless actions of some courts, some places that  have refused to take up critically important issues that will mean this  country has a future as a republic or will end that future and move us  into the socialism that brings totalitarianism. But they refuse to take  it up.  You can understand, if you have no courage, then you would rather not  take up an issue that might make some people mad, even though, as I  figured out early in my career as a judge, if I was going to run from  the job I ran for, I shouldn't even be there.  Most judges haven't figured that out. Some are appointed, but they  were appointed after they sought those positions. Well, if you are  going to run from the job you sought, you shouldn't have that job. Just  be honest and caring enough for the country that if you don't have the  guts to do the job, resign and go. You can mediate. You can arbitrate.  There is great money in arbitration. I had gone through the 3 days of  study and testing by the only institute at the time that prepared  people for international arbitration. There was great money in it. But  at the same time, I was told by a Member of Congress, now is the time  you need to start raising money.  Do I start raising money to run for Congress, or do I pursue the  extremely lucrative and rewarding career in international arbitration?  Well, I took the road less traveled by, and that has made all the  difference. Not a fun difference, but this is an important job. The  judiciary is an important job.  So, after the court refused to take up Mike Kelly's suit--totally  legitimate, should have been taken up--we have a lawsuit that was filed  a couple of nights ago by the Texas attorney general. It is styled  State of Texas v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, State of Georgia, State  of Michigan, and State of Wisconsin, so four defendants.  As Article III of our Constitution says: ``In all cases affecting  Ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a  State shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have original  jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned,'' which is up in  the first part of Section 2, ``the Supreme Court shall have appellate  jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under  such regulations as the Congress shall make.''  But this is a case, as the Constitution says, where the Constitution  provides for original jurisdiction in the Supreme Court. That means you  don't go to a lower court--not a magistrate, not a district judge, not  a court of appeals--but you go straight to the Supreme Court.  Now, I had filed things before in the Supreme Court, but I had never  filed an original action. I didn't realize until this week that on  something the Supreme Court is said by the Constitution to have  original jurisdiction, you can't just file. You have to come in and  beg: Oh, please, please, Mount Zion judges, please allow me leave so I  can file this petition because you have original jurisdiction over this  controversy, according to Article III of our Constitution.  Apparently, the Supreme Court has previously decreed that if you want  to file an original action, according to the Constitution, in our  Court, you have to come in and beg us for leave to file such an  original action. We may or may not let you file that lawsuit, even  though the Constitution makes clear it should be, it has to be,  originally in our Court and no other.  So, the State of Texas, by and through its attorney general, filed  this action. But they start by filing a motion for leave to file bill  of complaint. So, that is what they filed. They go through the motions  of doing what is required. Then, we get to the page that says ``Motion  for Leave to File Bill of Complaint,'' and it sets out--I am not going  to read the whole thing, but I think it is important that people  understand exactly what is involved here.  ``As set forth in the accompanying brief and complaint, the 2020  election suffered from significant and unconstitutional irregularities  in the defendant States:  ``Nonlegislative actors' purported amendments to States' duly enacted  election laws, in violation of the Electors Clause's vesting State  legislatures with plenary authority regarding the appointment of  Presidential electors.''  In other words, the Constitution makes clear the State legislatures  shall determine the appointment of the electors for that State as part  of the electoral college and nobody else. Not a judge, not a State or  Federal judge, not a commissioner, not a secretary of state, not a  Governor, but the legislature has to make that call of the State.  ``Intrastate differences in the treatment of voters, with more  favorable allotted to voters--whether lawful or unlawful--in areas  administered by local government under Democrat control and with  populations with higher ratios of Democrat voters than other areas of  defendant States.  ``The appearance of voting irregularities in the defendant States  that would be consistent with the unconstitutional relaxation of  ballot-integrity protections in those States' election laws.''  Those are three points made as to why this election suffered from  unconstitutional irregularities in those States that have been sued.  All of these flaws, even the violations of State election law,  violate one or more of the Federal requirements for elections. That  includes equal protection, due process, the Electors Clause, and thus  arise under Federal law.  So, it is not just that the Supreme Court, under our Constitution,  clearly has the original jurisdiction over this suit where a State sues  another State or States, but this involves a Federal question. In case  some on the Supreme Court are asleep or do not understand their  obligation, it is a Federal question as well as being a State versus  State.  In Bush v. Gore in 2000, the Court said: ``Significant departure from  the legislative scheme for appointing Presidential electors presents a  Federal constitutional question.''  The plaintiff, the State of Texas, ``respectfully submits that the  foregoing types of electoral irregularities exceed the hanging-chad  saga of the 2000 election in their degree of departure from both State  and Federal law. Moreover, these flaws cumulatively preclude knowing  who legitimately won the 2020 election and threaten to cloud all future  elections.''  I hope the Supreme Court--well, I know some of the Justices will take  particular interest and give attention to that. This is for the future  of the Republic.  As Eric Metaxas points out in his book, quoting from Franklin, when  he was asked, what have you given us? after the Constitutional  Convention in 1787 in Philadelphia. He replied: A republic, Madam, if  you can keep it. [["", Page , H7143, ]  I think the title of Eric's book is ``If You Can Keep It.''  Well, the answer will be determined in this case. If the Supreme  Court refuses to take it up and do their job, then the answer is, we  kept it from 1789 until 2020. Then, because we had people in States  that didn't do their job, or overzealously became partisan and allowed  circumstances, even participating in circumstances, to permit fraud and  to destroy the election process.  Any Republican that thinks, ``Oh, well, if I sound good, and I don't  stand up for the Constitution here, then I will be in good stead to be  the Republican nominee. Then, I can win the Presidency in 2024,'' the  news for those people is, if this fraud in this election is not  addressed and these unconstitutional schemes are not struck down by the  highest court in the country, there is not going to be a Republican  elected again. It is not going to happen.  So, it is rather important. History will judge us accordingly. From  the looks of what the Supreme Court did to Congressman Kelly's case, in  refusing to take it up, there is grave concern, appropriately, that the  Supreme Court is not going to do their jobs, that they will choose to  go down in history as the Supreme Court that allowed this Nation to  lapse as a republic.  There were rumors that the Chief Justice flipped his vote in the  ObamaCare case because he became very sensitive to the allegation that  if ObamaCare was overturned, he would become the most political Chief  Justice since Taney in the Dred Scott case. The rumor was that he  flipped and chose to uphold that decision, making him the most  political Chief Justice in American history, probably more so than  Taney.  In Taney's case--regardless of how you pronounce it--in that case,  that decision helped pave the way for the Civil War because the Supreme  Court did not do their job in protecting the rights listed in the  Constitution in the Bill of Rights. Likewise, this country is headed  for some very dire times if the Supreme Court doesn't resolve this  controversy and the fraud that underlies it.  Again, for those that say there was no fraud, wake up, look at the  evidence. There is sworn testimony. There is video footage.  Another thing that people need to understand about the judicial  system, it is not a new idea that one party to a suit would have  possession of evidence that would show that party should lose the  lawsuit. That has happened throughout jurisprudence.  Over the years, in the common law, a doctrine, a legal doctrine,  developed called spoliation. The doctrine is basically this: If one  party is in possession of evidence, or possesses the capacity to  preserve evidence, and they mix that evidence in with other evidence  that prevents a party from being able to show that it should win the  day, then that doctrine of spoliation can be utilized.  If there is a jury which is the fact-finder, the judge can tell the  jury that it may consider the fact that the defendant in this case had  possession of documents that would either prove or disprove the  plaintiff's case, and since the defendant refuses to produce them or  put them in a manner that they could not be identified or destroyed  them, then you may consider that that evidence supported the  plaintiff's case.  {time} 1330  And you can even take judicial notice, a court can, of a situation  like that. The Supreme Court could take judicial notice of that, that  one party has the evidence that will prove the plaintiff's case, and  they refuse to allow it to be found; or, as we saw in Pennsylvania, we  had a Supreme Court order to preserve evidence, and the eight actors in  Pennsylvania basically ignored the order so they could continue to hide  evidence. That should be evidence and should have judicial notice taken  that that evidence is the fact that they continue to hide what would  have proved the plaintiff's case.  So, as the brief says, taken together, these flaws affect outcome  determinative numbers of popular votes in a group of States that cast  outcome determinative numbers of electoral votes. This Court--and I am  talking about the Supreme Court since they have original jurisdiction-- should grant leave to file the complaint and ultimately enjoin the use  of unlawful election results without review and ratification by the  defendant States' legislatures and remand the defendant States'  respective legislatures to appoint Presidential electors in a manner  consistent with Electors Clause, and pursuant to 3 U.S.C. section 2.  So that is the motion for leave to file.  And then we get to the bill of complaint that Texas is seeking to  have permission to file.  Oh, please, oh, most holy Supreme Court, please, lower yourselves to  allow us to be heard before your Court of original jurisdiction.  Please, oh, please.  How many times do we need to say it to affect the high and mighty  Supreme Court?  Well, the bill of complaint actually has an appropriate quote from  John Adams: ``That form of government, which is best contrived to  secure an impartial and exact execution of the laws, is the best of  republics.'' And that is exactly what we will be losing if we do not  preserve the integrity of this election.  The bill of complaint goes on to say: ``Our country stands at an  important crossroads. Either the Constitution matters and must be  followed, even when some officials consider it inconvenient or out of  date, or it is simply a piece of parchment on display at the National  Archives. We ask the Court to choose the former.  ``Lawful elections are at the heart of our constitutional democracy.  The public, and indeed the candidates themselves, have a compelling  interest in ensuring that the selection of a President--any President-- is legitimate. If that trust is lost, the American Experiment will  founder. A dark cloud hangs over the 2020 Presidential election.  ``Here is what we know. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a  justification, government officials in the defendant States of Georgia,  Michigan, and Wisconsin, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . . .  usurped their legislatures' authority and unconstitutionally revised  their State's election statutes. They accomplished these statutory  revisions through executive fiat or friendly lawsuits, thereby  weakening ballot integrity. Finally, these same government officials  flooded the defendant States with millions of ballots to be sent  through the mails, or placed in drop boxes, with little or no chain of  custody and, at the same time, weakened the strongest security measures  protecting the integrity of the vote--signature verification and  witness requirements.''  And I might inject here, in the State of Georgia, on Saturday night,  being there with the President, David Perdue, Kelly Loeffler, and so  many other wonderful Georgia officials--and I do love the State of  Georgia. It seemed like I spent 20 years there because I was in the  Army, but my 4 years at Fort Benning, I grew to love the people of  Georgia. We still have many great friends in the State, so it is always  a pleasure to have an excuse to go back to Georgia.  That was a rough time in our history. People did not appreciate those  of us that wore the uniform. We didn't have it as bad as those who had  recently come back from Vietnam, but it was a very unpleasant time to  be in uniform. There were times when we were ordered not to wear it;  yet, generally, the people of Georgia were just superb.  I was there and Vernon Jones showed me an envelope he had gotten from  America Votes, sometimes referred to as Stacey Abrams' group, but it  had a return address on the envelope here in Washington, D.C., and  apparently they sent out millions of these requests for absentee  ballots.  It seemed like something like that ought to be reserved to a  governmental entity so that those are not sent to people who shouldn't  be getting them, that government ought to update their records and make  sure they are not sending them to dead people or to people who have  been moved to other States, other jurisdictions for 40 years, as we  have already heard in some cases.  There was all this information about absentee ballots and pushing the  recipient to fill it out, send it in, and even a postage-paid envelope  was provided, which provides something of value to somebody for them to  send in that absentee request. [["", Page , H7144, ]  But I just thought: Wow. So Washington, D.C., has gotten involved in  the State of Georgia's election in trying to skew the vote there. It is  really interesting.  But getting back to this complaint by the State of Texas, it says:  ``The only date that is mandated under the Constitution is . . .  January 20, 2021, U.S. Constitution Amendment 20.  ``Against that background, the State of Texas . . . brings this  action against defendant States based on the following allegations:  ``1. Plaintiff State challenges defendant States' administration of  the 2020 election under the Electors Clause of Article II, Section 1,  Clause 2, and the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.  ``2. This case presents a question of law: Did defendant States  violate the Electors Clause, or, in the alternative, the 14th  Amendment, by taking--or allowing--nonlegislative actions to change the  election rules that would govern the appointment of Presidential  electors?  ``3. Those unconstitutional changes opened the door to election  irregularities in various forms. Plaintiff State alleges that each of  the defendant States flagrantly violated constitutional rules governing  the appointment of Presidential electors. In doing so, seeds of deep  distrust have been sown across the country. In the spirit of Marbury v.  Madison, this Court's attention is profoundly needed to declare what  the law is and to restore public trust in this election.  ``4. As Justice Gorsuch observed recently: ``Government is not free  to disregard the Constitution in times of crisis. . . . Yet, recently,  during the COVID pandemic, certain States seem to have ignored these  long-settled principles.''  That is in the case of Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, New York  v. Cuomo, a case from 2020. The petition or the complaint says that  this case is no different now.  ``5. Each of the defendant States acted in a common pattern. State  officials, sometimes through pending litigation, for example, settling  `friendly' suits, and sometimes unilaterally by executive fiat,  announced new rules for the conduct of the 2020 election that were  inconsistent with existing State statutes defining what constitutes a  lawful vote.  ``6. Defendant States also failed to segregate ballots in a manner  that would permit accurate analysis to determine which ballots were  cast in conformity with the legislative set rules and which were not.  This is especially true of the mail-in ballots in these States by  waiving, lowering, and otherwise failing to following the State  statutory requirements for signature validation and other processes for  ballot security, the entire body of such ballots is now  constitutionally suspect and may not be legitimately used to determine  allocation of the defendant States' Presidential electors.''  I interject here. A good example, and this also brings in the  doctrine of spoliation, where, in Georgia, you had people lie to get  people out of the area in which ballots were being counted, and then  once they were all out and there was no big water leak, there may have  been a slight leak in a commode, but they were moved out. You can see  the video. But then out from under tables comes suitcases full of  ballots that these people who are unwatched to ensure that these were  legitimate ballots, they started running them through and counting  them.  Well, my understanding is they have refused to make those ballots  available for examination. And that is where spoliation comes in. They  have got the evidence; they refuse to produce it; so the presumption  should be made by the Supreme Court, if those ballots were produced by  the people who have sole control over them, they would prove the  plaintiff's case; therefore, plaintiff's case is proven and the results  are no longer viable and valid.  The complaint goes on: ``Each of the defendant States acted in a  common pattern.''  I touched on that.  ``7. The rampant lawlessness arising out of defendant States'  unconstitutional acts is described in a number of currently pending  lawsuits in defendant States or in public view including:  ``Dozens of witnesses testifying under oath about the physical  blocking and kicking out of Republican poll challengers; thousands of  the same ballots run multiple times through tabulators; mysterious late  night dumps of thousands of ballots at tabulation centers; illegally  backdating thousands of ballots; signature verification procedures  ignored''--and I would interject, and those put in batches where it  could not be determined what signatures came with that ballot. That  ought to lead to spoliation evidence--``signature verification  procedures ignored; more than 173,000 ballots in the Wayne County,  Michigan, center that cannot be tied to a registered voter;  ``Videos of: poll workers erupting in cheers as poll challengers are  removed from vote-counting centers; poll watchers being blocked from  entering vote-counting centers--despite even having a court order to  enter; suitcases full of ballots being pulled out from underneath  tables after poll watchers were told to leave.  {time} 1345  ``Facts for which no independently verified reasonable explanation  exists: On October 1, 2020, in Pennsylvania, a laptop and several USB  drives used to program Pennsylvania's Dominion voting machines were  mysteriously stolen from a warehouse in Philadelphia. The laptop and  the USB drives were the only items taken, and potentially could be  taken to alter vote tallies; in Michigan, which also employed the same  Dominion voting system, on November 4, 2020, Michigan election  officials have admitted that a purported `glitch' caused 6,000 votes  for President Trump to be wrongly switched to Democratic candidate  Biden. A flash drive containing tens of thousands of votes was left  unattended in the Milwaukee tabulations center in the early morning  hours of November 4, 2020, without anyone aware it was not in a proper  chain of custody.  ``8. Nor was this court''--talking about the Supreme Court--``immune  from the blatant disregard for the rule of law. Pennsylvania itself  played fast and loose with its promise to this court. In a classic bait  and switch, Pennsylvania used guidance from its Secretary of State to  argue that this Court should not expedite review because the State  would segregate potentially unlawful ballots. A court of law would  reasonably rely on such a representation. Remarkably, before the ink  was dry on the court's 4-4 decision, Pennsylvania changed that  guidance, breaking the State's promise to the Supreme Court.''  In the October 28, 2020, decision, it said: ``We have been informed  by the Pennsylvania Attorney General that the Secretary of the  Commonwealth issued guidance today directing county boards of elections  to segregate late-arriving ballots.''  Well, it turns out they lied to the Supreme Court. And if the Supreme  Court will not have at least enough self-respect to call down a State  that lies to the Court to get a ruling they want, then that is one  worthless court.  It is the same problem we have had with the FISA courts and why I  want to eliminate them. They didn't even have enough self-respect that  when they found out they were lied to in a number of manners in order  to get a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, they didn't get upset.  They didn't put anybody in jail. They didn't hold anybody in contempt.  A court that worthless needs to be eliminated.  As my law school professor, David Gwynne, used to say, you know,  every Federal court in America, except for one, owes its existence and  jurisdiction to the U.S. Congress. That, of course, the Supreme Court.  We brought them into the world, we should be able to take them out. And  that should happen when they don't even have enough self-respect to  enforce the truthfulness required to make that court operate.  In Republican Party versus Boockvar, November 6, 2020, a quote from  that decision: ``This court was not informed that the guidance issued  on October 28th, which had an important bearing on the question whether  to order special treatment of the ballots in question, had been  modified.''  That was from Justice Alito.  ``10. The probability of former Vice President Biden winning the  popular vote in the four defendant states--Georgia, Michigan,  Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin--independently given President Trump's  early lead in those States as of 3 a.m. on November 4, is less than [["", Page , H7145, ] one in a quadrillion, or one in''--well, I am not even sure what that  number is. Maybe quadrillion. I guess that is 15 zeros. ``For former  Vice President Biden to win these four states collectively, the odds of  that event happening decreased to less than one in a quadrillion to the  fourth power.  ``13. By purporting to waive or otherwise modify the existing State  law in a manner that was wholly ultra vires and not adopted by each  State's legislature, defendant States violated not only the electors  clause, but also the elections clause, to the extent that the Article I  elections clause textually applies to the Article II process of  selecting Presidential electors.  ``14. Plaintiff States and their voters are entitled to a  Presidential election in which the votes from each of the States are  counted only if the ballots are cast and counted in a manner that  complies with the preexisting laws of each State. The President and  vice president of the United States are the only elected officials who  represent all the voters in the Nation. Voters who cast lawful ballots  cannot have their votes diminished''--or the term we have heard over  the last 4 years, disenfranchised--``by States that administered their  2020 Presidential elections in a manner where it is impossible to  distinguish a lawful ballot from an unlawful ballot.  ``15. The number of absentee and mail-in ballots that have been  handled unconstitutionally in defendant States greatly exceeds the  difference between the vote totals of the two candidates for President  of the United States in each defendant State.  ``16. In addition to injunctive relief for this election, plaintiff  State seeks declaratory relief for all Presidential elections in the  future. This problem is clearly capable of repetition, yet evading  review. The integrity of our constitutional democracy requires that  States conduct Presidential elections in accordance with the rule of  law and Federal constitutional guarantees.  So that is critical.  ``18. In a Presidential election, `the impact of the votes cast in  each State is affected by the votes cast for the various candidates in  other States.'''  That is in the Anderson case, 460 U.S. at 795.  ``The constitutional failures of defendant States injure plaintiff  States because `the right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or  dilution of the weight of a citizen's vote just as effectively as by  wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.'''  And that is from Bush versus Gore.  In any event, Mr. Speaker, it is critical that the Supreme Court step  up and take the jurisdiction that the Constitution requires it to take.  It won't be fun and it won't be pleasurable, but it is absolutely  essential that the U.S. Supreme Court do what the Constitution created  them to do, take up this matter with which it has original jurisdiction  and determine there were unconstitutional actions taken that affected  the outcome of this election. It was not a free and fair election, and  if the Supreme Court does not act accordingly, then, really, the  Supreme Court is irrelevant, Congress is irrelevant; and those who  would seek to hide ballots in the future, create improper ballots,  count ballots multiple times, they will control the future of this  country, not the Supreme Court, not Congress, but a newfangled  electronic--not just electronic. They used every method known to man.  It will make Tammany Hall, and has made Tammany Hall, look like Mister  Rogers' Neighborhood. It is time to act. It is time preserve the  Republic.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
