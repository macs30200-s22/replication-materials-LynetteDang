Albio Sires,0.3167714178562164,D," Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman DeFazio for  including a provision in this bill that is a triumph in national  transportation financing.  Our States are riddled with bridges that are too old, roads that are  in disrepair, and passenger rail that is falling apart. Regionally and  nationally significant projects, projects that everyone can agree are  important and need to be built, have languished for years because of no  Federal help. This bill changes that.  I am proud to say that this bill's provision on projects of national  and regional significance is a victory for the Gateway Project. New  Jersey knows how important it is to get the project done. The whole  region knows how important the project is to its economy. This bill  puts $9 billion into the pot.  The bill provides money for clean energy investments to keep our air  clean, money for resiliency projects to protect us from stronger  storms, and more money for public transit to keep cars off the road.  There is no reason why we can't have a modern, efficient, clean  national infrastructure. This bill puts us on our way, and I am proud  to have been involved in the development since the beginning. I am  proud to cosponsor, and I ask everyone to support this bill.    "
