Ken Calvert,0.2932676076889038,R," Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation.  First, I want to thank Chairwoman Lowey for her hard work and her  dedication to this institution, and I wish her well in her retirement.  And I certainly want to thank our ranking member for her hard work  and all the things that went into getting this bill together. I know it  is difficult. We certainly appreciate it.  And, finally, Chairman Pete Visclosky, not only my chairman, but my  close friend, who has worked hard on this bill, and he has done a  wonderful job over the years and is certainly a patriot who deserves  the credit in putting this Defense bill together.  The Constitution grants Congress the explicit and sacred  responsibility to provide for our Nation's defense. This bill before us  today does just that. It provides funding for many key programs  consistent with the National Defense Strategy and its focus on great  power competition with China and Russia.  The bill prioritizes and funds programs essential to our continued  military dominance. It provides our combatant commanders with the  resources and equipment they need to carry out their missions around  the world.  We continue key investments in fifth-generation combat aircraft,  ships, [["", Page , H7304, ] and two Virginia-class submarines, while also continuing to invest in  the essential research and development of new technologies essential to  maintaining U.S. military superiority.  We continue to prioritize the health and welfare of our men and women  in uniform. The funding in this bill reflects the longstanding concerns  that so many of our Members have had with Defense health programs,  sexual assault prevention, suicide prevention, and the long-awaited  electronic health record, which we need to get fixed.  We must get this bill signed into law as soon as possible. According  to the DOD comptroller, a continuing resolution wastes $1.7 billion per  month and stops many of the modernization priorities that are the  cornerstone of maintaining our military's superiority over near-peer  threats such as China and Russia.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we were able to overcome politically  charged issues to negotiate this final passage. I urge all the Members  to vote for it.    "
