Gerald Connolly,2.925051689147949,D," Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I would just simply close by reminding  everybody that bad planning exacerbated greatly the severity and  duration of this pandemic. And if we have learned anything, we have  learned that we need to plan, we need to have a plan, and that is  certainly true with our Federal agencies.  I believe this bill is a commonsense bill that will add to our  capability to respond quickly in the event of a resurgence of the  coronavirus, and I urge its passage.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Heck). The question is on the motion  offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) that the House  suspend the rules and pass the bill, ', H.R. 7496, ', as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
