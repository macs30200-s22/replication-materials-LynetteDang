Richard Hudson,0.1411499232053756,R," Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my friend and  my colleague, Congressman Greg Walden, on his retirement, following  more than 20 years representing Oregon's Second District here in  Congress.  As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Chairman Walden has  been a real mentor to me. I have seen firsthand Chairman Walden's love  for his country, dedication to his district, and hard work on so many  important priorities for our Nation, like healthcare, energy  independence, and telecommunications.  I have so many fond memories of the work we have done together and  the time we have spent. I especially enjoyed working with Chairman  Walden on "", H.R. 6, ', landmark legislation to combat the opioid crisis.  Chairman Walden, you will be dearly missed, but I wish you, Mylene,  Anthony, and your entire family all the best.  I urge my colleagues to join me in thanking Congressman Greg Walden  for his extraordinary service.    "
