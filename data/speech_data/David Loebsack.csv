David Loebsack,0.3683782815933227,D," Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this en bloc package, which  includes my amendment to increase investment of distributed wind  technologies and research within the Department of Energy's Wind Energy  Program.  Distributed wind is the use of typically smaller wind turbines owned  primarily by rural and local entities, such as homes, farms,  businesses, and public facilities to offset all or a portion of onsite  energy consumption.  This type of energy production strengthens American communities by  helping them become more energy independent while lowering costs for  consumers. Distributed wind also strengthens domestic manufacturing,  and, in fact, American-made wind turbines can be found in well over 100  countries around the world.  The funding provided over the past few fiscal years has helped  unleash distributed wind power's vast potential, but continued  investment is needed to support the critical research and development  that will further reduce costs and maximize the benefits of distributed  wind power.  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.    "
