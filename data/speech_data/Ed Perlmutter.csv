Ed Perlmutter,0.8610418438911438,D," Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, the second purpose I rise today is to  respond to one of my friends who is questioning the validity of the  election. He couldn't be more wrong. The gentleman from Alabama and I  work on legislation together. We cosponsored a bill that was just  signed. But with respect to his allegations and the allegations of  attorneys that there has been major fraud in this election, I can tell  you that they couldn't be more wrong. There is not a shred of evidence.  I would say to my friend, under the Constitution--under Article I,  Section 1.4--the States are in charge of their elections. And under the  section concerning the Presidency, Article II, Section 4, we choose  when we hear from the electors of the electoral college--which will be  January 6. But citing a New York Post article of an unnamed Democrat,  who supposedly is an expert in elections, certainly is not evidence.  In the cases across the country, there has been no evidence, and case  after case has been thrown out, as they deserve to be thrown out. In  fact, the Supreme Court just threw out a case yesterday concerning  claims against Pennsylvania and its election process.  Mr. Speaker, I don't understand how these attorneys can bring these  cases without facing sanctions by the various courts for bringing  frivolous, vexatious, and abusive litigation. This election was fair.  There have been many instances where they are trying to find some level  of fraud. No fraud has been found. Joe Biden is the President-elect,  and we will make him President on January 20, when the inauguration  occurs.    "
