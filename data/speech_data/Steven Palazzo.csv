Steven Palazzo,0.0298204068094491,R," Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the outstanding  career of service of Mr. Cannie Lee Cody.  Mr. Cody hails from Jacksonville, Florida, and volunteered at 18  years old to serve his country in the United States Coast Guard.  After a few years, he decided to follow the path to become a  detective. At the age of 29, Mr. Cody graduated as valedictorian from  the Duval County Patrol Academy. He served as a highway patrolman for 5  years, eventually reaching the rank of detective sergeant at the Duval  County Sheriff's Office.  In the 1960s, riots began to break out in Jacksonville, Florida. One  riot occurred on March 23, 1964, and on that evening, Mrs. Johnnie Mae  Chappell, a mother of 10, was shot and killed. Mrs. Chappell had  returned home by bus and then walked to a local store. Upon arriving  home, she realized she had left her wallet and went to look for it  along the highway.  According to witnesses, a dark sedan slowed down and a shot was fired  from the vehicle, which killed Mrs. Chappell. The case was left open  and unsolved.  Five months later, Mr. Cody and his partner encountered a young man  who they suspected was involved in the murder. This encounter led them  to three other assailants who also confessed to Mrs. Chappell's murder.  By this time, they had tracked down the murder weapon and enough  evidence to close the case. They gave the uncovered information to the  chief of police, but sadly, they were removed from the case and lost  their jobs a year later.  Mr. Cody had spent the following decades trying to get justice for  Mrs. Chappell and her family. For years, he sought vindication and to  expose the corruption of the officials involved.  Mr. Cody went on to write a book called ``The 14th Denial: A Civil  Rights Memoir,'' which inspired the movie ``Wanted Justice: Johnnie Mae  Chappell.'' Both the book and movie are thought-provoking and share an  incredibly important story.  For his service, Mr. Cody is being honored by the Department of  Veterans Affairs for his dedication to our country and the civil rights  movement.  Mr. Cody has spent his life fighting for what is right and serving  others. It is an honor to recognize the heroic career of service of Mr.  Cannie Lee Cody.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
