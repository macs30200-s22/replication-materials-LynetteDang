Gregory Meeks,1.4343359470367432,D," Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Espaillat, and I thank the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith). I also thank Representative  Kinzinger for his support and his collaboration in working collectively  to bring this bill to the floor for a vote.  The reason for this bill is actually very simple. Congress must be  clear that Russia cannot be part of the G7 while it does all it can to  undermine democracies, including our own.  What they are doing is inflaming some of the biggest challenges that  face the global community today. Congress has an oversight  responsibility here, and this bill simply makes that clear.  Through its actions, today's Russia continues to prove that it does  not intend to be a part of the global solution. Moscow interferes in  democratic processes across the globe, suppresses and poisons  opposition, and wreaks havoc in emerging nations in Europe--Ukraine and  Georgia being the most recent targets where they still remain, holding  sovereign land.  The list is long. Yet, I am concerned that the President of the  United States has repeatedly expressed his inclination to bring Russia  back to the G7. He has called it commonsense to include Russia. It is  not as long as they continue to behave the way they are.  It is crucial that the American taxpayer should not pay for this  bizarre and harmful courtship of Putin's Russia, the same Russia that  puts bounties on American soldiers in Afghanistan.  Of course, we should have lines of strategic communications open with  Moscow. I am one also open for dialogue. But with Russia's malfeasance,  we cannot welcome them to the table as our partners and allies at a  time when they do not share our democratic values or interests.  There is nothing short of the strength of America's stance as a  global leader at stake. We have to be leaders in bringing folks  together and standing for democracy and for what is good for democracy.  That is who we are as Americans. That is what this United States  Congress stands for.  We must do our oversight in this regard. We must give a message to  Russia that should it want to enter into the G7, it has to play by the  rules and not do undemocratic things or threaten democracy, whether it  is in the United States or any of our European allies.  Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank my colleagues for joining this bill in a  bipartisan effort, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    "
