Susan Brooks,0.0596408136188983,R," Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, this is my eighth speech in a  series on voter fraud, election theft, and the Presidential election.  There are three major flaws in America's elections that socialist  Democrats exploit to steal elections.  First, voting by illegal aliens and other noncitizens is rampant  because socialist Democrats made it illegal to require proof of  citizenship when illegal aliens and other noncitizens demand to be  registered to vote. In 2020, hundreds of thousands, and more likely  millions, of illegal aliens and other noncitizens legally voted for Joe  Biden after he promised them amnesty and citizenship if he is elected  President.  Second, vote-by-mail schemes are both horribly prone to voter fraud  and are illegal because they violate Article I, Section 4 of the  Constitution and Congress' ensuing designation, with minor exceptions,  of one 24-hour day as the election day during which citizens can vote.  Yet, in 2020, socialist Democrats foisted vote-by-mail schemes on  America in order to more easily engage in voter fraud and election  theft.  Third, the lack of photo ID requirements makes it easier for paid  socialist Democrat election thieves to steal elections with voter  impersonators. While socialist Democrats and the fake news media  repeatedly and falsely claim there was no voter fraud in 2020, what is  most startling is this: America was warned 15 years ago that this would  happen.  In 2005, a bipartisan Commission on Federal Election Reform co- chaired by Democrat President Jimmy Carter and Reagan White House Chief  of Staff James Baker issued a 105-page report specifically warning  about the very same systemic flaws the socialist Democrats used in 2020  to steal elections. The commission report warns: ``Elections are the  heart of democracy. If elections are defective, the entire democratic  system is at risk.''  Concerning noncitizen voting, the commission warned of a growing  noncitizen voting threat, citing 784 noncitizen votes in a contested  California congressional race. The commission recommended that ``all  States should use their best efforts to obtain proof of citizenship  before registering voters.''  Of course, that means repealing the socialist Democrat law that makes  it illegal for voter registrars to require proof of citizenship when  illegal aliens and other noncitizens demand to be registered to vote.  Concerning vote-by-mail schemes, the commission warned that vote by  mail is ``likely to increase the risks of fraud and of contested  elections,'' adding that it remains ``the largest source of potential  voter fraud'' because it is ``vulnerable to abuse in several ways.  Blank ballots mailed to the wrong address or to large residential  buildings might get intercepted. . . . Vote buying schemes are far more  difficult to detect when citizens vote by mail.''  The commission recommended minimizing voting by mail.  On voter ID, the commission warned that the lack of photo ID opens  the door to voter fraud and strongly recommended a photo ID requirement  for voters, noting that ``photo IDs currently are needed to board a  plane, enter Federal buildings, and cash a check. Voting is equally  important,'' and that ``voters in nearly 100 democracies use a photo  identification card without fear of infringement on their rights.''  The commission recommended that ``citizens should identify themselves  as the correct person on the registration list when they vote.'' The  problem ``is not the magnitude of the fraud. In close or disputed  elections, and there are many, a small amount of fraud could make the  margin of difference.''  How prophetic.  Mr. Speaker, America's republic is only as good as its election  system. On January 6, 2021, I have a choice. I can ignore truth,  surrender to socialism, and accept electoral college submissions from  States with election systems so badly flawed as to render their vote  submissions unreliable, untrustworthy, and unworthy of acceptance. Or I  can fight for America and move to reject them.  I can't speak for anyone else, but as for me, Mo Brooks from  Alabama's Fifth Congressional District, I choose to fight for America.    "
