Glenn Thompson,0.2106490284204483,R," Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this  legislation.  To be clear, this package is nowhere near enough. House Democrats  passed three times more relief in May; our Republican colleagues did  nothing. We passed more than double this 2 months ago; our Republican  colleagues did nothing.  This package is not commensurate to the magnitude of the crisis we  face. We need to do more, including vital aid to State and local  governments and help for our restaurant industry, but this is a start.  This legislation includes important funding for vaccine distribution,  schools, small businesses, and a desperately needed extension of  unemployment insurance.  I am pleased that this legislation also extends clean energy tax  credits, provides disaster tax assistance, helps prevent tragic flame  jetting accidents, and provides help for the hardworking men and women  in my district and across this country.  Madam Speaker, this is not enough, but it is a start. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes.''    "
