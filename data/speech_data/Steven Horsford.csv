Steven Horsford,0.3120384216308594,D," Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, this global pandemic has devastated  Nevada's economy, forcing thousands of Nevadans to be laid off from  work.  Nevada's unemployment rate was last reported to be 11.8 percent. My  hometown of North Las Vegas reported the State's highest unemployment  rate at 14.6 percent.  Nevada's families are hurting.  Constituents contact my office every single day about their  unemployment insurance concerns, especially regarding the Federal  unemployment compensation benefits which expire at the end of this  month.  Now that this pandemic is ravaging our country again, many States and  localities are considering more stay-at-home orders.  We in Congress must act to make sure Americans who are unable to work  because of this virus receive the Federal unemployment compensation  that they need to survive until we get a vaccine that is free and  available to everyone.  It is my hope that any COVID relief package that becomes law provides  extended unemployment insurance benefits, direct cash payments, and  additional State and local funding so that we can provide support to  people who need it the most.
