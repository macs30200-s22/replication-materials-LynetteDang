Glenn Grothman,0.1709703356027603,R," Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, as I look around the room here, it looks  like I am in the U.S. Congress. I mean, I see the American flag there;  George Washington is over there; it says ``In God We Trust.'' But  looking at this bill [["", Page , H9156, ] today, it makes me feel like we are in the Parliament of Afghanistan,  Burundi, Yemen, or Bolivia.  Do we really think the way to improve the quality of life for  Americans is to just print more money from the Fed? If you look around,  we are going to be printing another $400 billion.  Has anybody looked lately at what is going on with the monetary  supply? M1 up 50 percent; M2 up 20 percent.  Don't people realize that just printing more is not a way to make our  citizens wealthier; it is just a way to debase the currency?  The way for a wealthy country is to work hard through frugality and  through improving one's skills, not by having the Fed print money.  Last time, when we sent out $1,200 checks, I stopped by my local  Walmart, and the people in charge of the electronics section said they  had never seen such sales in their life.  Is that really going to improve the lot of Americans, to go over and  buy some more electronic junk from China? Apparently so.  And let's not forget when we look at inflation. We have inflation  right now. Twice, in the recent past, we have changed the definition on  what inflation is.  So we do have inflation; it is just that we keep changing the  definition to mask it. That is why the market is up. The market is up  because we really do have inflation.  We are in the U.S. Congress. We should not think the way to  prosperity is just printing money. We should act like we are the United  States. That is why, for my whole life, other countries like to invest  in the dollar. They respect the value of the dollar more than the  national currencies of Burundi, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Bolivia. Those  are four poor countries; that is why I picked them out.  So I encourage Senator McConnell to hold the line here, to act  responsibly.    "
