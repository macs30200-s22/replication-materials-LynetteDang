Mac Thornberry,0.0695809498429298,R," Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and once again want  to commend him for his stewardship of the committee through very  challenging times.  Madam Speaker, I continue to support this bill, as more than 80  percent of the House did just 20 days ago. It is the exact same bill,  not a comma has changed.  It still prevents the military from having their pay cut. It still  creates new tools to deal with a newly aggressive China. It still  includes the important U.S.-Israel Assistance Act and provides help for  Vietnam veterans.  One thing, I guess, is new in the past few days, because a  devastating cyberattack by Russia has been exposed; but, fortunately,  this bill has dozens of provisions to help strengthen the country's  defenses in cyber.  So the President has exercised his constitutional prerogative. Now,  Madam Speaker, it is up to us. Our troops, the country, indeed, the  world is watching to see what we will do, whether we can tune out other  differences and still come together to support the men and women of the  military and American national security.  I would only ask that, as Members vote, they put the best interests  of the country first. There is no other consideration that should  matter. This vote is about supporting our troops and defending America.  While not perfect, this bill does a good job of advancing both and  should be supported once again.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
