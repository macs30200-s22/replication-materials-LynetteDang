Adam Smith,2.3864636421203613,D," Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  I rise to strongly urge Members to uphold what we did in this Chamber  just a couple weeks ago and what the Senate did, as well; and that is  we passed an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill, with roughly 80 percent of  the vote in both the Senate and the House.  The legislative branch made it absolutely clear that we support this  piece of legislation, and as the gentleman from Texas just noted, we  support it with very good reason.  It is enormously important to give our troops the support that they  need to carry out the job that we all are asking them to do. That is, I  think, one of our minimum obligations as Members of Congress. And this  bill reflects that.  This bill is the process of a lengthy effort involving Members of  both Chambers, both parties, that have come together and put together  an incredibly strong piece of legislation. That is why it passed so  overwhelmingly just a couple weeks ago. And nothing has changed.  Nothing has changed. The bill is exactly the same and every little bit  as important.  Now, the President has the right to veto it, but I think we, as  Members of [["", Page , H9161, ] the legislative body, have to look at the reason behind that. Was it  because of something in the bill?  Pieces of legislation come through here all the time, and we  occasionally miss something. The President finds out, and we say: Gosh,  I didn't know that. That is not what happened here.  I really want Members to understand the President vetoed this because  of something that isn't in the bill and was never going to be in the  bill, something totally unrelated to national security and something  that we were not going to do in any event.  There is literally no reason to veto this bill for the reasons that  the President did and certainly no reason for us not to uphold what we  did in passing this bill. This is really important that we exercise our  legislative prerogative.  There are all kinds of crucial provisions in this bill, but I will  just point to one, and that is the one that Mr. Thornberry mentioned  earlier, to give you an idea of why it is important that the  legislative branch do its job in exercising oversight of the Department  of Defense in providing national security policy, and that is the cyber  issue.  Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Langevin, chairman of the  subcommittee that deals with this issue, and Ranking Member Stefanik,  they have worked together to really put together an incredible package  to try to better address these very cyber issues that we are now  facing. That is what we do in this legislation, and it is not always  exciting, but it is incredibly important to meet our obligation to our  troops and to the national security of this country.  It is enormously important that we pass this bill. We did it once.  Let's just do it one more time, and then we can all go home for the  year. We can be done, and we can be proud of what we have accomplished.  I urge Members to vote in favor of this bill to do what we did just a  couple weeks ago. Show the country that the legislative branch can  still do its job.  I will close on one note, which we make a lot of times.  {time} 1700  This is the most bipartisan committee in Congress. That is not an  easy thing to achieve. We have a lot of things that we passionately  disagree about in this body, and we should, but on the Armed Services  bill, we manage to come together. It is not always easy, but we get it  done.  I think it is enormously important that we let the country know that  that process hasn't died. We put together a product, a bipartisan,  bicameral product that has gotten an overwhelming number of votes.  Let's show the American public that the legislative process works at  least a little bit better than sometimes they think it does, that we  can get our job done and, in this case, get our job done for the men  and women who put their lives on the line to protect this country. We  owe them nothing less than that.  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees  on the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, I rise in  strong opposition to the Administration's seemingly callous veto of the  William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2021 and proudly announce my intention to vote to override  this reckless veto.  I take this action because I disagree with the President that  preserving monuments and memorials and naming military installations  for the defenders of slavery who took up arms against the United States  to achieve their aims is more important and a higher priority than  providing the funding, resources, and support to the nation's military  and civilian defense person, one of the nation's most respected  institutions and its most diverse and representative.  Other than his pique at being on the short end of what is by his own  account an Electoral College landslide and being routed by seven  million votes in his failed bid for reelection, there is absolutely no  basis for the erstwhile Commander-in-Chief to veto the bipartisan NDAA  and deny our servicemembers a long-overdue pay raise and hazard duty  pay many of whom live in or are from my congressional district.  It is cruel, shameful, and heartless for a Commander-in-Chief to deny  to more than 100,000 federal employees the paid family leave child  care, housing and health protections authorized by the FY2021 NDAA or  to withhold from our veterans the benefits that they need and deserve.  The FY2021 NDAA Conference Report, negotiated under the careful  stewardship of Chairman Adam Smith of Washington and Ranking Member Mac  Thornberry in the House and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman  James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Ranking Member Jack Reed of Rhode Island  is carefully crafted, exemplary legislation reflecting the nation's  sacred commitment to those who willingly risk their lives, fortunes,  and sacred honor to keep our nation safe and preserve, protect, and  defend the Constitution.  The FY21 NDAA provides a long-sought after benefit for tens of  thousands of Vietnam-era veterans who are struggling with certain  health complications after being exposed to Agent Orange while serving  their country.  In addition, the legislation authorizes $8.4 billion in military  construction projects to fortify critical infrastructure and base  realignment and closure clean up, it contains important new tools to  deter adversaries China and Russia from attacking or threatening our  national interests; and mandates reforms to make the Pentagon more  efficient, innovative, and cost-effective.  In the legislation there are significant bipartisan provisions to  strengthen our posture on artificial intelligence and cybersecurity and  to fortify our alliance with NATO and our security relationship with  Israel.  With the passage of the FY2021 NDAA, expectant mothers in the  military could receive free loaner maternity uniforms because the  legislation directs the Department of Defense to conduct a pilot  program to issue maternity uniforms and related items to pregnant  military members on a temporary and as-needed basis.  Madam Speaker, this is important because women make up about 21  percent of the Air Force; 20.2 percent of the Navy; 15.4 percent of the  Army; and 9 percent of the Marine Corps.  Also, the FY2021 NDAA makes needed reforms to prevent sexual assault,  a matter of great importance to the public and my colleagues,  particularly those of us from Texas, where Fort Hood is located and  where Army Specialist Vanessa Guillen was murdered to prevent her from  reporting the sexual harassment and abuse she suffered from her direct  superior in the chain of command.  I am very grateful to Congressman Brown of Maryland, himself a  veteran of the Armed Services, for his leadership in ensuring the NDAA  authorize and approve the renaming of military bases currently named  for persons who took up arms for the Confederacy and against the United  States.  I am very pleased that included in the legislation is my language  directing the consideration be given to distinguished and heroic  African-American and Native American servicemembers in the renaming of  military bases.  Removing the stain of bases and military installations being name for  confederate traitors is an act of profound reconciliation and healing.  For too long African Americans servicemembers have been forced to  tolerate the hidden racism that existed under the guise of the rebel  flag, knowing through oral history the brutality of those who  voluntarily fought for the Confederacy.  The FY2021 NDAA ushers in a new enlightened era where the names of  traitors who took up arms against the United States will have their  names removed from places of honor such as military bases or  installations.  These individuals will not be forgotten; instead they will have a  permanent place in history and their records will be studied and  examined in full by historians and scholars.  Madam Speaker, it is also fitting that FY2021 NDAA directs the  Department of Defense to take concrete actions to recognize and  memorialize the contributions made by African Americans and Native  Americans servicemembers in defense of our nation.  The history of African Americans and Native Americans serving in the  military date back to the colonial period of our nation to the present  day.  In every war waged from the Battle of Lexington to the Battle for  Fallujah, African Americans and Native Americans have honorably  answered the call to duty, and served with great valor and distinction  in America's armed forces.  At decisive moments in our nation's history, the United States  military and its citizens warriors answered the call and were decisive  in the nation's epic battles for freedom and liberty, including:  Revolutionary War (1776-1783); War of 1812 (1812-1814); Mexican- American War (1836); Civil War (1861-1865); Spanish-American War  (1898); World War I (1914-1918); World War II (1941-1945); Korean War  (1950-1953); Vietnam War (1965-1975); Gulf War (1991); and Operations  Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, as well as conflicts in other  theaters of war. [["", Page , H9162, ]  The military was there doing a job no other branch of our nation's  government could do--in the face of overwhelming danger--when the fate  of the American Experiment was on the line.  Our thanks to the military for always answering the call of duty-- whether that call comes in the dead of night or the light of day--we  know that we can count on you.  The names and faces of millions of African Americans who have served  our nation in uniform may fade from memory, but today we have the  opportunity to remember and see them in the faces of the young men and  women who preserved freedom in the world, even at a time when the  blessings of liberty were denied to them at home.  The Jackson Lee provision in the FY2021 NDAA recognizes that there is  no shortage of distinguished veterans, and especially African American  and Native American veterans, who are worthy of the honor of naming a  military facility in their honor.  Let me provide for the record some representative candidates.  UNITED STATES ARMY  General Roscoe Robinson Jr., the first black four-star general in the  Army and 1951 West Point graduate who attended the service academy  before the Army was desegregated and served in Korea and Vietnam, with  valor decorations in both conflicts, and as a training officer as part  of the U.S. military support mission in Liberia. He went on to become  the first black commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, deputy chief  of staff for operations in U.S. Army Europe, commander of U.S. Forces  Japan, the U.S. representative on the NATO Military Committee.  William Harvey Carney was the first African American recipient of the  Congressional Medal of Honor, which he received for his actions on July  18, 1863 at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, while a member of the 54th  Massachusetts Regiment in the Civil War--the state's first all-black  regiment.  The 54th Massachusetts was the subject of the film, ``Glory,''  starring Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman.  Lieutenant Colonel Charity Edna Adams was appointed to lead the  African American Women's Army Corps unit designated as the 6888th  Central Postal Directory Battalion, which became known as the ``Six  Triple Eight.''  The ``Six Triple Eight'' unit was instrumental in establishing and  maintaining morale because it assured that mail from the battlefront  and the home-front flowed efficiently and timely.  Lt. Col. Margaret E. Bailey of the Army Nurse Corps was the first  nurse to be promoted to lieutenant colonel.  UNITED STATES NAVY  Messman First Class Dorie Miller was serving in a noncombat role in  the Navy, when he acted heroically to defend lives after his ship, the  USS West Virginia was attacked at Pearl Harbor.  He was the first African American to be awarded the Navy Cross, the  third highest honor awarded by the United States Navy at the time.  Admiral Michelle Howard is a four-star Admiral and one of the  highest-ranking African American women ever to serve in any branch of  the military. Admiral Howard is also the first African American woman  to command a U.S. naval vessel, the USS Rushmore.  She is the Navy's second highest ranking officer and is currently  serving as the commander of U.S. Naval Forces Africa, commander of U.S.  Naval Forces Europe, and commander of Allied Joint Force Command  Naples.  UNITED STATES AIR FORCE  In 2012, Lieutenant Colonel Shawna Rochelle-Kimbrell became the first  female African American fighter pilot in the Air Force history and her  flights in Northern Watch marked her as the first female pilot to fly  combat missions for Misawa's 35th Fighter Wing and the first African  American woman to employ ordinance in combat. She has logged more than  1,110 hours in the F-16, including 176 hours of combat time.  Colonel Ruth A. Lucas was the first African American woman in the Air  Force to be promoted to the rank of colonel. At the time of her  retirement in 1970, she was the highest-ranking African American woman  in the Air Force.  In 1959 General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. became the first African  American Major General in the United States Air Force. As the organizer  and commander of famed 332nd Fighter Group known as the Tuskegee  Airmen, his place in history will be forever remembered and revered.  General Davis received many decorations during his career, including  two Distinguished Service Medals and a Silver Star and on December 9,  1998, General Davis was awarded his fourth general's star by President  Bill Clinton.  UNITED STATES COAST GUARD  Chief Petty Officer Alex Haley is best known for writing letters for  his shipmates and his short stories and articles, which got him  promoted to Chief Journalist of the Coast Guard in 1959.  Haley ultimately received a number of military honors, including the  American Defense Service Medal, World War II Victory Medal and an  honorary degree from the Coast Guard Academy but most of you know him  also as the author of ``Roots,'' the path-breaking and epic retracing  of a family's history from the Gambian coast in Africa to the New World  in America.  In 1957, Captain Bobby Wilks became the first African American Coast  Guard aviator. He later became the first African American to reach the  rank of Captain and the first to command a Coast Guard air station. He  accumulated over 6,000 flight hours in 18 different types of aircrafts.  Madam Speaker, 25 percent of the today's active duty military is  comprised of persons of color, of which 17.8 percent are African  American.  This percentage outpaces the percentage of African Americans in the  general population (13 percent) but lagging significantly is the 9% of  African Americans in the commissioned officer ranks.  NATIVE AMERICANS  The Jackson Lee Amendment offered during House consideration of the  NDAA was expanded to include Native Americans.  It is without doubt that the military has a storied history of Native  American contributions to the securing our nation since colonial times  to the present.  One famous example of their contributions occurred during World War  II when the U.S. military developed a specific policy to recruit and  train Navajo speakers to become ``code talkers.''  Code Talker is the name given to 29 Navajo Natives who used their  tribal language to send secret communications on the battlefield.  The Marines formed the Navajo Code Talkers, who created a code based  on the complex, unwritten Navajo language.  The code primarily used word association by assigning a Navajo word  to key phrases and military tactics.  This system enabled the Code Talkers to translate three lines of  English in 20 seconds, not 30 minutes as was common with existing  codebreaking machines.  The Code Talkers participated in every major Marine operation in the  Pacific theater, giving the Marines a critical advantage throughout the  war.  During the nearly month-long battle for Iwo Jima, for example, six  Navajo Code Talker Marines successfully transmitted more than 800  messages without error.  Marine leadership noted after the battle that the Code Talkers were  critical to the victory at Iwo Jima.  The Navajo Code was never broken.  Our Native American brothers and sisters are more than worthy to be  so honored by having their names considered for military bases and  installations.  BOOGALOO AND PROUD BOYS  Another Jackson Lee Amendment included in the House version of the  NDAA directed the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress the  extent, if any, of the threat to national security posed by domestic  terrorist groups and organizations motivated by a belief system of  white supremacy, such as extremist groups like the Boogaloo Boys and  the Proud Boys, is reflected in the Conference bill.  The concern is that in the aftermath of a historic national election,  the activity of violence influencers like Boogaloo Boys or Proud Boys  will increase and lead to attacks becoming more frequent.  We have witnessed too many instances of violent extremists searching  for opportunities to sow violence and disrupt democratic processes and  Boogaloo and Proud Boys are targeting constitutionally protected  activity to coopt or to provide cover for attacks.  Jackson Lee Amendment 179 implements a recommendation made by the  Cyberspace Solarium Commission to require the Secretary of Homeland  Security to develop a strategy to implement Domain-based Message  Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) standard across  U.S.-based email providers to increase the security of email,  The security of email has grown in importance as it has become in  many ways the primary way that businesses, consumers, government  communicate.  The Senate bill also addressed this important issue and the language  of the final Conference concurs.  For all these reasons, I urge all Members to join me in voting to  override the President's unwise and ill-considered veto of the William  M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2021.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered.  There was no objection.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Will the House, on  reconsideration, pass the bill, the objections [["", Page , H9163, ] of the President to the contrary notwithstanding?  Under the Constitution, the vote must be by the yeas and nays.  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question  will be postponed.    "
