Ed Case,0.6298374533653259,D," Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of ', H.R. 6585, ' with deep  reservations.  I support the substance of the measure as addressing key concerns for  American Indians and Alaska Natives. My grave concern is with the  inexplicable omission of Native Hawaiians as indistinguishably  indigenous peoples of this country to be treated and included the same.  I spelled out my concerns at length in a submission to the record of  my Committee on Natural Resources on this measure and I include in the  Record my statement:  U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources:  July 29, 2020 Full Committee Markup on ', H.R. 6535, ':  Additional Remarks for the Record:  U.S. Congressman Ed Case:  Chairman Grijalva, Ranking Member Bishop and fellow   Committee members, I respectfully submit these additional   remarks for the record on ', H.R. 6535, "", introduced by my friend   and colleague on the Committee, Mr. Gallego, also Chair of   the Committee's Subcommittee on Indigenous Peoples of the   United States on which I am also honored to serve.  "", H.R. 6535, "", considered and unanimously reported by this   Committee on July 29, 2020, would extend federal tort claims   coverage for certain personal injury claims to urban Indian   organizations by deeming them part of the Public Health   Service, similar to current coverage provided to Indian   tribes, tribal organizations, Indian contractors and   employees. I fully endorse this measure and was pleased to be   able to support it in both Subcommittee and full Committee.  However, I must register my deep concern that Native   Hawaiian Health Care Systems (NHHCS) have not also been   extended the same coverage in this measure or otherwise.   Although there are legitimate procedural and related non-  substantive reasons for not including them in this specific   vehicle, I wish to affirm for the record that this is clearly   unfinished business that should and must be remedied by this   Committee and Congress at the earliest opportunity.  The current federal tort claims coverage extends to many   health care providers serving American Indian and Alaska   Native individuals in the Indian Health Service (IHS) and   tribal facilities as part of the undertakings and obligations   of our country to our indigenous peoples. Whole segments of   our indigenous populations depend on these providers for   their health needs, in particular primary and preventive   care. The practical effect of covering these critical   organizations under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) is to   simplify the processing and resolution of medical malpractice   and other personal injury claims against the organization,   which expedites settlement of legitimate claims and decreases   administrative and related expense burdens, thus enabling   providers to deliver more extensive and better service to   their communities.  FTCA coverage has extended for decades to the IHS and   tribal organizations including indigenous-focused federally   qualified health centers (to include Native Hawaiian   Community Health Centers (NHCHC).) However, for reasons that   reflect simple omission rather than any other explanation,   urban Indian organizations and NHHCS, first established under   the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act of 1988, are   not currently covered under the FTCA. This bill would correct   that as to urban Indian organizations but not NHHCS.  There is no policy or functional differentiation among   urban Indian organizations, NHHCS, tribal organizations and   NHCHC in FTCA coverage, nor between NHHCS and urban Indian   organizations. Both urban Indian organizations and NHHCS are   devoted to the same needs for the same reasons as the others.   In fact, in Hawai'i, where we have the largest population of   Native Hawaiians of any state but relatively few Native   Americans and Alaska Natives, our NHHCS actually contract   with the IHS to provide our own and visiting Native Americans   and Alaska Natives with reduced cost health care and payer of   last resort services (and at actual costs that far exceed the   contracted amounts).  Moreover, in the public health context, there is every   reason for Native Hawaiians to seek the same benefits as   afforded to other indigenous organizations under FTCA   coverage. Even aside from COVID-19, Native Hawaiians suffer   from the shortest life expectancy of the major ethnic groups   in Hawai'i due to underlying medical conditions such as   diabetes, coronary heart disease and asthma. With higher   unemployment rates, Native Hawaiians are in particular need   of the culturally relevant, lower cost health care options   offered by Native Hawaiian-focused organizations like NHHCS.   All this has been worsened by COVID-19, which has inflicted   some of the highest infection and mortality rates on Native   Hawaiian/Pacific Islander communities nationwide. The   extension of FTCA to NHHCC is just one of many initiatives   that can make a real difference in ensuring NHHCS can   continue to serve their own populations in these times of   great challenge and need.  During my Subcommittee on the Indigenous Peoples of the   United States' July 19, 2020 hearing on "", H.R. 6535, "", I asked   IHS Director RADM Michael D. Weahkee whether there was any   policy reason to differentiate between NHHCS, urban Indian   organizations and other tribal health care providers in FTCA   coverage. Director Weahkee responded: ``In one of my roles as   Indian Health Service Director, I serve as the Vice Chair of   the Interdepartmental Council on Native American Affairs at   the Department of Health and Human Services, and that   responsibility extends not only to our American Indian and   Alaska Native populations, but also to our Native Hawaiian   and Pacific Islanders, and so in that chair I would see the   same advantage toward Native Hawaiian programs as I discussed   here today for our American Indian urban Indian   organizations.'' Further, the Congressional Budget Office   previously reviewed similar legislation, the Native Hawaiian   Health Care Improvement Reauthorization Act of 2003, and   determined there was no appreciable cost to the federal   government.  Aside from these bill specifics, I ask this Committee to   understand and appreciate my Native Hawaiian community's goal   of extending FTCA coverage to NHHCS, and its great concern at   being excluded from "", H.R. 6535, "", as not just a policy   inconsistency but in a much broader context. To repeat,   Native Hawaiians are the indigenous peoples of our country to   the same degree and extent as other indigenous peoples. As   such, the United States has undertaken a similar special   trust responsibility to Native Hawaiians dating back to   Hawaii's entry into the United States as a territory in 1900,   and continuing through the seminal century-old Hawaiian Homes   Commission Act of 1920 and some 150-plus more Native Hawaiian   federal statutes and equally if not more numerous specific   regulations, administrative actions and other initiative   since including the Native Hawaiian Education Act and Native   Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act. This is not a new or   questionable relationship in any way and has the same long   and often difficult history as other indigenous peoples.  Notwithstanding, Native Hawaiians have faced decades of   being overlooked, ignored and excluded in our federal   initiatives to fulfill our country's trust responsibilities   to our indigenous peoples. It has proven too easy to ask   Native Hawaiians to just wait while we take care of another   indigenous concern first, while too often the wait has not   materialized into any later action. So please understand that   when Native Hawaiians express great concern over exclusion   from a seemingly straightforward bill like "", H.R. 6535, "", their   skepticism, apprehension and distrust has deep roots that   transcend this specific bill.  Chair, Ranking Member and Committee colleagues, I   personally appreciate your consideration of my additional   remarks on behalf of our country's vital Native Hawaiian   community, and hope that I have provided you with some   broader appreciation of why we believe that inclusion of   NHHCS in FTCA coverage as is provided for virtually all other   indigenous health care organizations is so important. I look   forward to working with your and our like-minded colleagues   to achieve such inclusion in other appropriate vehicles.  Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much).  I fully expect that further measures I am asked to support   of benefit to American Indians and Alaska Natives will   include Native Hawaiians.  Thank you.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by [["", Page , H7247, ] the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, ', H.R. 6535, ', as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
