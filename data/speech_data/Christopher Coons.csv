Christopher Coons,0.6241970062255859,D," Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee,  as a member of the Bar Association of Delaware, and a Member of the  U.S. Senate. I am concerned about the transformation of our Federal  judiciary under this current administration. I am particularly  concerned about rising issues around qualification and competency. Let  me speak to that, if I might, for a few minutes.  This Senate is doing precious little in terms of legislating, but we  are moving at a breakneck pace to confirm President Trump's judicial  nominees--roughly, 150 so far. During the entire 8 years of the  previous administration, 55 circuit court judges were confirmed. Nearly  that same number have been confirmed in just 3 years of the Trump  administration--48. Nearly one in seven of all U.S. district court  judges currently serving have been appointed by President Trump.  I am deeply concerned about the quality of some of these nominations.  Some have never taken a deposition, argued a motion, let alone tried a  case in court. The American Bar Association, the professional  association of lawyers, has ranked nine of President Trump's nominees  as ``not qualified,'' which is an exceptionally unusual and striking  step for them to take.  This isn't about whether the President's nominees are conservative or  not. I understand that elections have consequences and that a  Republican President will more often than not nominate conservative  judges. I have, in some cases, joined my Democratic colleagues in  supporting qualified nominees put forward by the administration who  have won support from their home State Senators and advanced through a  bipartisan judicial nomination and confirmation process in our  committee, but let's be clear. I will not stand by while this  administration rams through nominees who are not just Republican and  not just conservative but demonstrably unqualified.  I can't support nominees with deeply concerning records about their  commitment to justice and to advancing a commonsense juris prudence. I  am not going to set a standard any lower than what has been required in  previous administrations to serve on the Federal bench for many, many  years.  We have heard in this Chamber and around this country that the  quality of the Federal bench and the capabilities and the experience  and the values and the judgment of those who serve on Federal benches  across this country is an absolutely essential piece of our  Constitution and our ordered liberty. [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S6876"">Page S6876</a>, ] The cases that come before Federal courts are too important to tolerate  incompetence, inexperience, or bias in the Federal judiciary.  Why does this matter both in terms of the process and the substance?  The President has put forward nominees who, in my view, would take us  backward on civil rights and voting rights, on women's access to  healthcare, on laws that protect consumers and workers, and on the  environment. Their decisions impact every American. Equally concerning  is that Trump's nominees don't reflect the diversity of our Nation. We  want litigants to go into a court and be able to have their day in  court and be confident that the judge before them represents the  breadth and range of America.  So far, of the 55 circuit court nominees confirmed, only 11 have been  women, and they have been even less racially diverse. Of all of  President Trump's nominees, 87 percent are White and 78 percent are  men. I think the judiciary should reflect the diversity of the American  people and have strong records and a wealth of experience. Sadly, that  is not the case for several we have considered, and let me briefly  speak to two.  President Trump's nominee to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of  Appeals, who was recently confirmed, Lawrence VanDyke, raised serious  concerns about his work ethic and his temperament. He was rated ``not  qualified'' by the ABA based on concerns about his lack of knowledge of  basic procedural rules and his commitment to being truthful. Six  retired justices of the Montana Supreme Court questioned his fitness  when he ran for the Supreme Court in Montana and expressed concerns  about his partisanship and the possibility of corporate influence. He  is opposed to basic civil rights and civil liberties for the LGBTQ  community and made a range of statements that I think would be  disqualifying under any circumstance.  Sarah Pitlyk, who this Senate just confirmed this week to a lifetime  seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri,  has never tried a case, either criminal or civil, has never taken a  deposition, has never examined a witness, and has never argued a motion  in Federal or State court. The ABA unanimously rated her as  ``unqualified'' for a lifetime seat in the Federal judiciary.  We can and we should do better than this. Of the entire bar of the  State of Missouri, I am certain there are qualified, capable, and  seasoned conservatives who could have been nominated for that seat in  the entire Ninth Circuit. In particular, the State for which Mr.  VanDyke was nominated, there are certainly abundant opportunities to  choose qualified nominees. We can and we should do better than this.  In my State of Delaware, my senior Senator, Tom Carper, and I worked  together to help form a bipartisan judicial nominating committee to  fill two vacancies on our district court. We felt strongly we had to  reach out to the White House and work with them to identify consensus  nominees who would be the best candidates we could best support and  whom the President could nominate. Ultimately, we had a very productive  process, and the President nominated Maryellen Noreika and Colm  Connolly, whom we both returned positive blue slips for. They  ultimately have been confirmed by this Senate, seated, and now serve in  our district court. This is how the process should work.  We should be able to consult back and forth between the executive and  legislative until we find competent, capable, and qualified judges of  whom we can all be proud of. The Senate should not be a rubberstamp for  this administration, regardless of the quality of nominees that get  sent forward.  I will continue to oppose President Trump's nominees who are  undeserving of a seat on the Federal bench and unqualified to serve. It  is, in my view, our responsibility to guard against the politicization  of the Federal judiciary, and we should work together, not to tear down  and destroy the traditions and rules of this Senate but to find ways to  strengthen and sustain them. That is how we will move qualified and  consensus nominees forward and protect the independent judiciary on  which our very democracy rests.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
