Josh Hawley,0.9421839714050292,R," Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, just two brief points this evening--the  first is that I am proud to join not only as a supporter of this  measure but as original cosponsor, and I want to thank the other  Senators--Senator Rubio, especially Senator Cardin, and Senator Risch-- for their leadership on this issue, but I want to be clear that we are  here today in this Chamber, and what we are doing is possible tonight  because of the bravery and the courage of the protesters in Hong Kong.  Many of them are very young people who are risking their very lives,  taking to the streets, standing for democracy, standing for the  promises that were made to them by Beijing many years ago and fighting  for them now, putting everything on the line. And I just want to say to  those protesters that you are making a difference, that your lives have  made a difference, and to those who even now are trapped inside PolyU  in this siege that the Hong Kong police force has created--this  humanitarian crisis that the Hong Kong police force has fostered--what  you are doing is inspiring the world. What you are doing has moved this  body. What you are doing is changing the world. Thank you for your  courage. Thank you for your bravery. Thank you for believing in your  city, and thank you for believing in Hong Kong.  The other thing I would say is that, while today is a good day in the  struggle to preserve the freedoms of this city and the struggle against  a totalitarian regime in Beijing, it is not the last day. Although this  step is an important step that this Chamber takes, it is not the last  step that this Nation may need to take in order to hold China to its  commitments made in 1984, in order to protect the autonomy and the  liberty of the city of Hong Kong because, make no mistake, we are in  for a long struggle with Communist China. We are in for a long struggle  with Beijing. We know what their ambitions are: to dominate Hong Kong,  to dominate Taiwan, to dominate the region and, ultimately, to impose  their will on the entire international system. We are going to have to  stand against that for freedom, for liberty, for our security and our  prosperity.  So there is much to do. There is a long road ahead of us, but today  is a good day, and I hope the people of Hong Kong will see that the  people of the free world are awake, that they are with you, and we are  ready to stand together.  I yield the floor.    "
