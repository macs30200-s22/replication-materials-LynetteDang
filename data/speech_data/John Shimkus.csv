John Shimkus,0.0198802724480628,R," Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, as ranking member on the Subcommittee of  Environment and Climate Change, I want to thank Chief Counsel Mary  Martin, Deputy Chief Counsel Jerry Couri, and senior professional staff  member, Peter Spencer, for their tremendous support of me and  commonsense, practical legislation that has protected human health and  the environment and supports jobs and the economy.  If the public knew how hard that committee staff members work, they  would have a better appreciation of our government. Mary, Jerry, Peter,  you have my personal thanks.  I would also be remiss if I didn't thank the loyal opposition,  Democrat Staff Director Rick Kessler and Democrat Senior Counsel Jackie  Cohen. Although many times adversaries, both have become friends.    "
