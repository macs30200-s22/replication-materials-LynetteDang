Lamar Alexander,0.3107529878616333,R," Mr. ALEXANDER. We have a vacancy at the Food and Drug Administration.  So what if someone said: Wouldn't it be a good idea to go see if we can  recruit the chief medical officer at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in  Houston, one of the most distinguished institutions in the world, an  organization that is even larger than the FDA? Wouldn't it be a good  idea to go get a practicing oncologist? Wouldn't it be a good idea to  get somebody who has worked at the National Institutes of Health and  who has letters of recommendation from more than 80 organizations?  Wouldn't it be a good idea to get someone who has been recommended and  endorsed by the last five FDA Commissioners, under Presidents Trump,  Obama, and Bush?  Well, we have such a person. That person came out of our committee 18  to 5--Dr. Stephen Hahn, the Chief Medical Officer of the MD Anderson  Cancer Center. We should be grateful he is willing to take this job at  this period of time.  I urge a ``yes'' vote, Mr. President.    "
