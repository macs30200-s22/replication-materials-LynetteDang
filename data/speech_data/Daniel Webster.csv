Daniel Webster,0.0397605448961257,R," Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McClintock for  yielding.  I rise today in opposition to "", H.R. 737, "", the Shark Fin Sales  Elimination Act. As a Floridian and member of the House Natural  Resources Committee, promoting shark conservation has long been a  priority of mine. I am glad to see sharks receiving national attention.  Sharks play a crucial role in our ocean's ecosystem, and yet, they  face a [["", Page , H9082, ] grave threat: shark finning, a cruel practice of capturing sharks,  clipping their fins, and casting the rest of it to a slow death in the  ocean. This practice is cruel and inhumane.  I was a member of the legislature almost 30 years ago when Florida  was one of the first States to ban shark finning. Since then, finning  has become completely illegal in the United States.  Unfortunately, finning still occurs in unregulated waters around our  globe. ', H.R. 737, ' will do nothing to protect sharks from being finned in  those areas. Instead, it would require American fishermen who legally  and responsibly land sharks to destroy or discard their fins, leading  to terrible waste.  Many scientists, conservationists, and commercial fishermen have  vocally opposed this bill and have said it will not advance shark  restoration or stop the practice of finning.  This bill would have a devastating effect on responsible American  fishermen, including many in my own district in Florida who have made  sacrifices to conserve and rebuild our shark populations.  I offer a separate bill, an alternative, ', H.R. 788, ', one that has been  sponsored and supported by Senator Rubio in the Senate and is probably  the key bill there for this particular issue. Instead of banning the  sale of humanely sourced shark fins, my bill would encourage bad actors  in the shark fin market to create science-based management systems for  shark conservation.  {time} 1430  My bill requires any nation seeking to export shark, ray, or skate to  the United States to first be certified by NOAA that it has  conservation policies in place that rise to the standards of U.S.  fishermen and that forbid nations to practice shark finning.  The U.S. plays an important role on the world stage in fishing  management and conservation. ', H.R. 737, "" would remove the U.S. from the  shark fin market; it would silence the leading voice in shark  conservation--my bill would amplify it--and ensure no finned shark fins  enter into the United States.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to make the best choice for  sustaining shark populations long-term and oppose this deeply flawed  bill before us today.    "
