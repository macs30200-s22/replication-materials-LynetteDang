Dean Phillips,1.7179830074310305,D," Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor my  dear friend and colleague, Representative Harley Rouda, on the occasion  of his 59th birthday today.  Congressman Rouda is as passionate as he is principled, and a  reliable voice of reason during very unreasonable times. In celebrating  him today, I am reminded of the words of Teddy Roosevelt, who wrote:  It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out   how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could   have [[', Page , H7140, ]  done them better. The credit belongs to the man who was   actually in the arena, who actually strives to do the deeds,   and spends himself in a worthy cause.  Mr. Speaker, just like the former President, I know that Harley's  place will always be in the arena and never on the sidelines.  Annalise joins my family and yours--Kaira, Trace, Avery, Shea, and  Dylan--in wishing Harley a happy and healthy birthday and a whole lot  of love.    "
