Lloyd Smucker,0.1689823120832443,R," Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I also rise today to honor the brave men  and women in my district and across America who have been working hard  to combat COVID-19.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, doctors, nurses, and medical  professionals in hospitals, long-term care facilities, and community  health centers have committed long hours away from their families to  put the needs of others before their own. They have worked without  pause to keep our community healthy and to care for those in need.  Throughout this pandemic, farmers, producers, truck drivers, and  manufacturers have also worked without pause to provide for us all. The  farmers and agriculture producers in my district adjusted to changes in  supply chain operations to keep our Nation fed. Truck drivers and  logistics professionals ensured deliveries of essential goods and  personal protective equipment were delivered, and delivered on time.  Educators have also faced significant challenges this year, but they  have continued to provide students with the best education possible in  these circumstances. Adapting to the challenges of remote instruction,  educators in school districts had to adjust quickly to make sure  students are still receiving that quality education. America's teachers  always rise to the occasion, and they have done so once again.  Madam Speaker, we also honor the brave servicemembers in the United  States Armed Forces who are away from their families for this upcoming  holiday season, and we pray for their continued safety. We must also  hold their families in our hearts as they, too, serve our Nation with  bravery while their loved ones are abroad.  Madam Speaker, lastly, I thank everyone here in the Capitol working  hard to put safety measures in place so we can be here in Washington to  serve and work for the American people. I know that brighter days lie  ahead for our neighbors and nations. Therapeutics and vaccines are  going to help us turn the corner on this virus.  Please keep your loved ones and neighbors in mind. Wear a mask, wash  your hands, and practice social distancing this holiday season.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
