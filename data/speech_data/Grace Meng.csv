Grace Meng,1.0449007749557495,D," Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, as millions across our nation continue to be  impacted by the coronavirus, many continue to live in fear following  the dramatic increase of threats and attacks against those of Asian  descent since the COVID-19 outbreak.  Since January 2020, there has been a significant number of reports of  anti-Asian incidents; wherein, due to scapegoating Asian Americans for  the spread of COVID-19, many are being threatened, harassed, or  assaulted, or have had their businesses vandalized. The upsurge of  racial discrimination against Asian Americans has been fueled by  misinformation about the coronavirus and usage of anti-Asian rhetoric  and terms like ``Chinese virus'' and ``Kung-flu.'' All of our nation's  leaders must stop using these racist phrases that instigate hatred and  violence. In the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, Asian Americans are left  fighting an additional front--that of hate and bigotry.  That is why I introduced a resolution condemning all forms of anti- Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19. We, as leaders of this nation,  must coalesce and condemn all manifestations of expressions of racism,  xenophobia, discrimination, and anti-Asian sentiment and scapegoating.  We must denounce any and all anti-Asian sentiment of any form.  Madam Speaker, during this time of heightened anxiety and fear  surrounding COVID-19, we cannot lose sight of protecting the health and  safety of every single person--no matter their race, ethnicity,  religion, or background. The House must take a strong stand against the  sickening intolerance, bigotry, and violence that is leaving a terrible  stain on our nation's history, especially during this moment of an  unprecedented public health crisis. The adoption of this resolution is  a necessary step to confront the second pandemic of racism and  discrimination in this country. I urge my colleagues to join me in this  effort to keep all Americans safe.    "
