Anthony Brindisi,2.034342050552368,D," Mr. BRINDISI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of "", H.R. 7105, "".  I am proud that this bill includes the Chuck Osier Burial Benefits  Act, which would require the VA to furnish an urn or a plaque if a  deceased eligible veteran was not interred in a traditional cemetery.  All veterans deserve to be honored for their service, regardless of how  their families choose to lay them to rest.  It is named in honor of Chuck Osier, an Air Force veteran from  Sherrill, New York, who passed away in 2015. Because Chuck was not  interred in a traditional cemetery, his family could not honor him with  a VA-furnished marker.  His widow, Donna, has been working with Members of Congress from  central New York for years to get this fixed. I am proud to stand here  for Chuck and Donna and finally get this bill passed.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation for our Nation's veterans and their families.  Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), my good friend, my neighbor just  north of me in Kentucky, and a very, very prominent member of the  Veterans' Affairs Committee.
