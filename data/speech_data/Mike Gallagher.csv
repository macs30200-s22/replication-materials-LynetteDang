Mike Gallagher,0.6169635057449341,R," Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member not only for  yielding, but for his leadership and setting an example of just being  one of the most thoughtful legislators that I have ever witnessed, and  so I thank him for his mentorship and his leadership.  I am very proud to support this bill, which includes many of the  critical recommendations of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, which I  have had the privilege of co-chairing over the past year with my good  friend Senator Angus King, and serving alongside my distinguished  colleague and IETC Subcommittee Chairman Jim Langevin, who has  forgotten more about cybersecurity than most of us, certainly myself,  will ever know in our lifetime, and so his leadership has been  incredible.  Early on in the Commission's work, we recognized that one of our  greatest challenges would be navigating through the many committees of  jurisdiction, and it is precisely because of that challenge that I am  especially proud that we were able to work across party and  jurisdictional lines to get many of our key recommendations either in  the underlying text or in a bipartisan amendment.  I know over the course of the day, Congress will be advancing even  more of the Commission's recommendations, such as strengthening the  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, establishing a  national cyber director, establishing a joint planning office to  coordinate cyber planning and readiness.  Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank the committee chairman as well for  working with us and the rest of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission. A  great deal of effort went into our work. We had more than 50  legislative proposals. I am greatly thankful for his help and  everyone's help, and especially Representative Langevin, in getting the  work of the committee across the finish line.  There is no shortage of work left to be done to better secure us in  cyberspace, but today we are taking a number of very, very important  steps.    "
