Katie Porter,1.0244126319885254,D," Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Under the Higher Education Act, students who are defrauded by private  predatory colleges are entitled to relief on their loans. The prior  administration created a streamlined process to help defrauded  borrowers access relief and move forward with their lives.  Secretary DeVos tried to strip those protections away, but we fought  back. Some of my Republican colleagues in the House and Senate voted  with us to overturn Secretary Betsy DeVos' new rule. We came together  to defend students and to stand up against fraud, waste, and abuse.  But President Trump vetoed this important resolution. Instead of  standing with students and taxpayers, President Trump stood with  corrupt private colleges and Secretary DeVos.  Today, I ask my Republican friends: Do you want to stand with our  country's students, with the future of our workforce and our  communities, or do you want to betray them to please the President? I  think the choice is clear, and I hope you do, too.    "
