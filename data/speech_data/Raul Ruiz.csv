Raul Ruiz,2.802842855453491,D," Mr. RUIZ. In terms of the third violation, which is the most  outstanding and outrageous violation, it was that procedures were done  without the women's informed consent. There were gynecological  procedures, as was mentioned: total hysterectomy; partial hysterectomy;  most of them were oophorectomies; most of them were cystectomies.  But the point here is that whenever you have any gynecological  procedure, that can result in scarring, future pain, possible chronic  pain, and also infertility. Therefore, you need informed consent.  It is medical practice to have informed consent, which requires an  explanation of your disease, of the illness, of the procedure,  including risks and any alternative options, including the option of  doing nothing, in the language that the patient understands.  Not doing so, not documenting it, is a violation of that informed  consent. Violating informed consent and putting a blade to a woman's  body, without her understanding or her informed consent, is an assault.  That is why we need fully to condemn this practice. That is why we  need to fully investigate through the inspector general, through the  FBI, through the Georgia medical and surgeon license board to ensure  that this doesn't happen, that it is not happening in other private  detention facilities throughout the country, in rural areas where  perhaps they think they might get away with it because, after all,  these are very disempowered women without very strong advocacy in those  locations.  I am very thankful for the lawyers, for those that brought this to  light, [["", Page , H5651, ] that have empowered the voices, including a 22-year-old woman who now  will never be able to have children.  I support this resolution to send a very strong message to all  facilities and all doctors that every woman requires fully informed  consent before any procedure.    "
