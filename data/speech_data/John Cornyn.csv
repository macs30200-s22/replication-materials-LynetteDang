John Cornyn,2.79012393951416,R," Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, following the longest government shutdown  in history earlier this year, it seemed to be a bipartisan consensus  that we need to get back on track with the regular appropriations  process. Both parties knew there was a funding crisis at stake this  fall if we could not come together and reach a compromise, so this  summer, that is exactly what we did--or at least we thought we did. [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7138"">Page S7138</a>, ]  At the time we reached an agreement that set top-line funding levels  for defense and nondefense spending, there was a promise not to derail  the appropriations process with poison-pill policy riders, and we got  it done in August with plenty of time to spare. It wasn't perfect. No  negotiated product ever is, but we knew this agreement would provide us  the time and the space and the framework to get the appropriations  process back on track and leave room for necessary debate on government  spending habits. As our national deficit continues to grow, that could  not be more critical. I actually remember a time when concern about the  deficit and debt was a bipartisan concern, but apparently, it is not  currently.  Before we hit the first funding deadline, our Democratic colleagues  backed out of the commitment they made in August of 2019. The open  debate we hoped for did not happen. We were forced to pass two short- term funding bills known as continuing resolutions, and now, here we  are, just days away from the current continuing resolutions expiration,  reading text of these funding bills that total nearly $1.4 trillion. We  are reading these for the first time.  When it comes to the appropriations process, I have learned from  experience; you are never going to be 100 percent happy. That is just  the nature of compromise. You have got to weigh the good, the bad, and  the ugly and decide how the scales tip. There is certainly a lot of  calculating when it comes to these appropriation bills, but let me  start with the good. I think the national security appropriations  package goes a long way to rebuilding our military, providing them the  resources they need to maintain readiness, and providing our Armed  Forces with the resources they need to face growing threats around the  world. From adversaries like Russia and China, to rogue regimes like  North Korea and Iran, our military must be prepared to counter a  diverse range of threats.  This funding bill will continue the work of Congress under President  Trump to invest in our military by providing a nearly $20 billion  increase over last year's defense funding levels. It will provide funds  to both modernize and grow our aging fleet so we can continue to send  our troops around the world where they are needed. One of the major  challenges we face is the development of new technologies by our  adversaries. We cannot have our enemies deploying hypersonic glide  vehicles, artificial intelligence, and missile defense systems that  rival or perhaps surpass our own. That would be destabilizing. That may  produce a miscalculation, which would be dangerous.  This bill sends funding toward the research and development of new  technologies so we can stay on the leading edge. We should not be  satisfied with anything other than America being in the lead when it  comes to our national security.  I am glad this package also includes a number of provisions that  support our men and women in uniform, including a 3.1 percent pay  increase, which is the largest in a decade. Above all, this defense  funding answers our commanders' request for steady and predictable  funding so they can address and plan for the threats of today and  prepare for those we will face tomorrow.  In addition to strengthening our national security, this package will  also make our community safer here at home. It sends vital funding to  the Department of Justice law enforcement grant programs and invests  $1.4 billion in the border wall system on the Southwest border. As a  border State Senator, I can tell you the Border Patrol, whom I consider  the experts when it comes to border security, say there are three  components of border security: There is physical infrastructure; there  is technology; and then there is the personnel, the boots on the  ground. This appropriation bill invests $1.4 billion in this system  that includes a border wall.  Despite concerted attempts from our Democratic colleagues, the  President's authorities to transfer funds that he deems necessary for  border security remain intact.  Now, the domestic spending bill takes strides to address some other  challenges. It allows us to bolster our fight against the opioid  epidemic, expand mental health access, and improve our crumbling  transportation infrastructure. It includes $400 million for farmers and  ranchers in Texas and elsewhere affected by drought, trade wars, and  low commodity prices. It would also send an additional half a billion  dollars to the Army Corps of Engineers that can be used for  infrastructure projects right here at home.  With less than a year until the next election, it would provide more  than $400 million in additional funds to safeguard our election systems  so that voters can head to the polls with the confidence that their  vote will be counted correctly.  As we continue to bring down healthcare costs for the American people  by providing them more choice and competition for their premium dollar,  this legislation permanently repeals some of the three most oppressive  ObamaCare taxes that are burdening American families: the premium tax,  the Cadillac tax, and the medical device tax.  This bill also extends funding for critical healthcare programs like  community health centers. This is the safety net in our healthcare  system, the community health center. It is something I have long  supported.  Despite pushes from our colleagues across the aisle, appropriators  also managed to fight off an electric vehicle tax credit expansion,  which would be nothing more than a taxpayer subsidy for wealthy  Americans who want to purchase electric vehicles.  There are a lot of great provisions in these appropriations bills to  address some of our top priorities, but I remain concerned that, with  some of the shortcomings, these could also be described as the bad part  of this appropriation process.  The domestic funding bill includes a range of controversial  provisions that will move us further away from our goal of decreasing  the national debt. It significantly increases deficit spending without  offsets or pay-fors for long-needed reforms for mandatory spending  programs, which are the primary cause of our deficits and debt,  accounting for about 70 percent of Federal spending.  This bill also includes a terrible provision, which is a retroactive  tax on American energy companies. We did this without any sort of  consideration by the committee of jurisdiction--the Finance Committee,  upon which I sit--with no opportunity to provide amendments or even a  debate on this massive retroactive tax. The only choice we are given  now that it has been included as a result of the negotiations among  five people is the choice to vote either up or down on this massive  piece of legislation.  This bill also extends other tax benefits, without addressing  problems with the Tax Code, which actually have a negative impact on  American businesses and families.  This funding bill would also extend the National Flood Insurance  Program, which is long overdue for reforms. This sidesteps the need for  those reforms entirely. The program is hemorrhaging money, and we need  to be looking at ways to improve it, instead of continuing to flush  good money down the drain.  As I mention, we started this process on a strong path with the  budget agreement that was reached in August. I know I wasn't alone in  thinking that would help us get the regular appropriations process back  on track, but things quickly took a turn--not for the good, not for the  bad--but for the ugly. Our colleagues let government funding come  second to their disagreements with the President. They tried to inject  the very poison pills they vowed to steer clear of and derailed the  process that they committed to restoring.  Rather than having an open debate and votes on spending, as we  planned, the process fell to just a handful of people negotiating  behind closed doors. This is reminiscent of the smoke-filled backroom  deals that Congress has long been criticized for, and we really have no  alternative but to vote up or down on this massive $1.4 trillion  spending package without any opportunity to debate it or, more  importantly, to change it by offering amendments.  The way I see it, this has been the plan of Speaker Pelosi and the  minority leader here in the Senate all along. If you think about it,  this really puts the power in their hands, which is exactly what they  want, and they can extract concessions and other things that [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7139"">Page S7139</a>, ] are important to them, rather than allow the process to work as it was  intended to do through regular order, through the regular  appropriations process.  This also takes power from their very own Members because no Democrat  or Republican can offer any amendment to this which can change it at  all under this closed process. So this really isn't just an affront to  the Members on this side of the aisle; it is an affront to their own  Members who have no opportunity to offer amendments or have meaningful  debate and modify the bill.  Our Democratic colleagues have held these appropriations process  hostage for the past several months. Over what? I think that is an  important question. Well, as it turns out, it was their obsession with  .3 percent of our Nation's budget. That is not how this process should  work, and it is certainly not how to make decisions that are in the  best interest of the country.  As further evidence of the rush to get this done without adequate  consideration or debate or amendment, our House Democrats even had to  violate their own 72-hour posting rule for major legislation just to  get this legislation done before we leave this week.  It is frustrating to see our colleagues across the aisle undermine  what could have been a very productive discussion about our Nation's  spending habits, about deficits and debt and what our priorities should  be, and, instead, chose to move forward with these bills, which fall  short in any number of places.  I must say that the majority leader, the Senator from Kentucky, was  committed to a process of getting these appropriations back on track so  we could give a voice to all Members in these negotiations and take  them up in an orderly fashion so amendments could be offered, and they  could be debated and voted on, all of which has now been swept to the  side.  I am also grateful for the tireless work of the chairman of the  Appropriations Committee in the Senate, the Senator from Alabama, Mr.  Shelby, as well as the other members of the committee who have been  negotiating an agreement to support our national defense and avoid  book-ending the 2019 year with a second shutdown.  As we move closer to a vote on these appropriations bills tomorrow, I  am going to continue to review their text. They are massive pieces of  legislation, and we have only recently gotten access to them. I will be  making my individual decision--as I trust each Member will--on whether  to support these appropriations bills and whether they represent the  best interests of their States and of the American people.
