Mark Walker,0.5657702088356018,R," Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding.  Today, as we wrap up three terms, we could not be more overwhelmed  with the privilege that it has been to serve the people of North  Carolina, specifically, central North Carolina, in the United States  Congress.  I am the oldest of three boys, Mr. Speaker, of a Baptist preacher  from the Panhandle of Florida and have had the privilege to live in  North Carolina since 1991. Coming out of college, and having the  opportunity to work, spending 16 years as a pastor, and then the last 6  years of serving in a different capacity.  What an honor to be able to walk the halls and to be able to think  about the history that has made this country what it is today.  We were blessed to hit the ground running, becoming the first Member  since its inception in 1973 to be elected chairman at the end of their  first term of the largest caucus, the conservative caucus of the  Republican Study Committee.  Recently, I have enjoyed extending and wrapping up a term as the vice  chair of the GOP Conference. What a privilege it has been to serve the  bulk of that time as cochairman with Senator James Lankford of the  Prayer Caucus. It has been a wonderful time to gather each Monday  evening--in fact, many people don't even know the Prayer Caucus  exists--for us to gather on that Monday evening after we fly in and for  many years to gather in room 219, right off to my right, and seek God's  guidance as we prayed for constituents and we prayed for the Lord to  give us the hope and direction for this country.  I have lots of reflections over these last 6 years. I think of having  a chance to be the starting pitcher for the Republican baseball team,  an exhibition game for charity. Every year has been quite a treat.  I am sure many of my Republican friends are glad to see that the  Honorable Cedric Richmond is now senior adviser to another gentleman  and no longer in the House.  But what a privilege it has been to see the efforts that goes to the  Boys and Girls Club, Mr. Speaker. And it has been neat that this has  been a tradition since 1909.  And there have been other times. There was the moment when I saw  Steve Scalise, our whip, come back from our teammates being shot at  that morning, and how he came back and has come back strong; and how he  has always represented his faith in a way that I think has impacted  potentially far beyond any political work that he may do in this House.  There have also been times to engage in a more stern manner, serving  on the House Oversight Committee with Chairman Jason Chaffetz. Chairman  Chaffetz did a wonderful job as the House Oversight Chairman as we went  after and questioned some of the unscrupulous behavior of James Comey  and Pharma Bro. In fact, I still think Peter Strzok doesn't really care  for me, but that is okay because sometimes the job requires it.  One of the moments that stand out on the House Oversight Committee  was questioning Cecile Richards, Mr. Speaker, when I asked her  specifically: Does it bother you that there are more African-American  babies aborted in New York State than actually born? I will never  forget that she was not even aware of that statistic.  Nor did I shy away from the fights on this floor. Probably the  darkest or the heaviest moment was when we were working and going back  and forth late into the night on the born alive amendment. And I cannot  help remembering just the heaviness and the oppression of that night,  as only three of my colleagues on the Democratic side stood up and said  a baby that survives a botched abortion should have the right to stay  alive.  I struggled with that. I still struggle with it. In fact, I think it  is apparently evil not to be able to stand up and fight for all of us  who are created in the image of God.  We have heard other comments. The dogma lives loudly. Even a good  friend and colleague from Illinois that was pro-life, that was someone  who advocated, is no longer part of the body and was basically run out  of town. I struggle with those things.  If our rights come from our Creator and, as our Founding Fathers said  they have in the past, do they not also come from the Creator in the  present and in the future?  Not too far behind us here is the rotunda. There are eight pictures  in the rotunda. The first four are depictions of our settlers, the  people who founded this country who came here. In all four of those  pictures, there is a depiction of Christianity.  The other four are depictions of our Founding Fathers. The last one  is my favorite. It is George Washington. The picture is of George  Washington, December 23, 1783, and in his hand he has his resignation.  For 8 years, he had been the commander in chief of the Revolutionary  Army. Yet, in that letter he writes, though he had, potentially the  ability, the military power behind him to be something of almost a  monarch again, he captured something. He realized that if this country  was going to be great, he had the foresight in that letter to write  that the power had to come from we, the people. What a powerful  expression.  As I think back over the last 6 years, I have traveled different  places, 20-something different countries. No place at all has impacted  me more than standing there on the shores there at Normandy. And as our  guide began to talk that day, I thought about this for the first time.  History shows us that those young men were supposed to have air cover  but, because of the horrific weather, there was none. That day wasn't  won by military might; wasn't won by great generals or colonels and  military genius. Our freedom today, we can trace back to that moment,  was won by 18- and 19-year-old young men who kept running up that hill,  one wave after the other. What a powerful place and what a privilege it  is to see these real heroes.  Arthur Ashe put it this way when he talked about heroism. He said:  True heroism is remarkably sober, very undramatic. It is not the urge  to surpass all others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve all  others at whatever cost.  In our 6 years, we have tried not to stick with the talking points.  Maybe we have had a little bit of a different approach serving in  Congress. I never surrendered my voting card either to the  establishment, to leadership, or any special interest group.  Mr. Speaker, I believe the best kind of representative that you could  have is someone who is pledging to represent all communities. You see,  America is the greatest country and the longest-lasting republic in the  history of the world; but the truth is, we didn't get it all right to  start with.  We first launched this idea of individual liberty and opportunity,  but it took a few people and a few years to get it right: The likes of  Frederick Douglass, George White, Shirley Chisholm, Jackie Robinson,  Mahalia Jackson, my friend, Clarence Henderson, and so many more  heroes. But here's the cool part of the story: We never quit trying  until our actions matched our words that in America all men would be  created equal.  One of the privileges that I have had is to serve with John Lewis and  cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge and to spend some time hearing his story  and hearing his history, because I believe this, whether Republicans or  Democrats, relationship is the conduit for good policy. People before  the politics.  You don't have to throw out what you believe or your values or your  principles. But are you genuine? Do we show up? Do we always have to be  the keynote speaker at times?  I was committed to doing this, to be both a conservative and a bridge  builder, and our team committed to that. Hardly a week went by that we  didn't answer the question, are we making an argument, or are we making  a difference?  In this town, those who make the most noise sometimes get the key  roles. But in looking back, making the difference is ultimately the  prize.  The successes? I believe it is simple; staying close to the Lord and  having [["", Page , H6852, ] the people pray and wrap their arms around us.  So many times, after spending a week in this arena, this gladiator  arena, you go back home depleted and kind of worn out. And I will never  be able to express my gratitude to the people who lifted their arms up  and prayed for us week after week.  A couple of months ago, I met Freddy in New Bern, North Carolina.  Freddy's a little street vendor with his guitar, and he had his guitar  case open and was hoping to make a few bucks. I had a chance to  harmonize with him as he played Let My Little Light Shine.  What a reminder this season that, ultimately, what our calling is, it  is to let our light shine.  I think of Luke 2; I think of all the different things in this season  that mean so much.  In this city, there are some ups and downs, there are some double- crosses, but I can tell you, I leave today with no bitterness, no axe  to grind, not jaded, with a genuine love for my colleagues.  I specifically have to point out three that I have had the privilege  of getting to know and having dinner with, basically, for about 3\\1/2\\  years, almost once a week, Tuesday evenings with Trey Gowdy, Senator  Tim Scott, and the Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe. I  love these men. They have impacted my life. There were times the  fellowship and the joy and the laughter, and even the merciless  cutdowns from Mr. Gowdy, were incredibly rewarding and timely.  But there are people behind the scenes here in Washington, D.C.,  names that you will never know, but people like Everette, Carmelita,  Lloyd, the people behind the scenes that continue to impact.  In closing today, I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the  people that made this possible, both in North Carolina and here in  Washington, D.C. My appreciation to Janine, Grace, Joel, Bradley, Kyle,  Phillip, Emily, Dwayne, Olga, Jerome, Amber, Cory, Ryan, Kevin,  Madeline, Dan, Alexa, Carson, Sruthi, Sean, Janae, Alison, Rudy, Kate,  Katie, Louis, Davis, Rusty, Zach, Scott, Arian, Josh, Carter, Keifer,  Dwayne, Luke, Graham, Lauren, Brian, and two chiefs, Scott and Jack,  and a deputy chief, Julie, who has been with me since the  very beginning. I am proud of you guys. We made a difference.  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to conclude by thanking my family,  Ryan, Rachel, Anna Claire, and Kelly. Thank you for allowing me to do  something that is considered pretty special by many.  To my mom and dad, thank you for investing in me and putting in the  values.  So, Mr. Speaker, I would like to close right now by expressing it may  be in the words of Andrae Crouch:  ``How can I say thanks for the things You have done for me? Things so  undeserved, yet You gave to prove Your love for me; the voices of a  million angels could not express my gratitude. All that I am and ever  hope to be, I owe it all to Thee. To God be the glory.''    "
