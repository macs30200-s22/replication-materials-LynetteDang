Lucille Roybal-Allard,1.1562577486038208,D," Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of ', H.R. 7617, "", and I  commend the chairs of the subcommittees who worked so hard to produce  funding bills that reflect our ``For the People'' vision for America.  The appropriation bills in this minibus provide critical resources  for our wide range of vital domestic and defense priorities. As vice  chair of the Labor-HHS Subcommittee, I will focus on that title of the  bill which, thanks to the efforts of Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro and  Ranking Member Cole, upholds our promise to Americans by investing in  our workers' needs, supporting the education of our children, and  ensuring all our families and communities have access to quality health  programs during this pandemic and beyond.  For example, the bill makes strong investments to strengthen the  ability of our public health system to overcome the current COVID  crisis, and equally important, to have the resources to build the  infrastructure critical to our ability to successfully address  public health challenges in the future.  Robust investments are also made to address the health disparities  COVID-19 has intensified, and the bill commissions a National Academies  of Sciences study on the most promising solutions to advance health  equity in the years ahead.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the Labor-HHS bill contains substantial  funding for many of my requests to support mothers and babies during  this pandemic and the months to follow. This includes large increases  to the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant and the Healthy  Start program, as well as strong investments in breastfeeding support  and a maternal mental health hotline.  Today, our children and families are suffering from the prolonged  isolation of school closures and the challenges of learning remotely  while parents try to work. As we fight the pandemic, this bill makes  critical investments to ensure our children safely receive a high- quality education.  During a time when so many Americans have lost jobs due to the  economic impact of this pandemic, the strong outlays in job training  and apprenticeships will help American workers gain the skills needed  to get well-paying jobs.  Mr. Speaker, Vice President Biden has said, ``Don't tell me what you  value. Show me your budget, and I will tell you what you value.''  I thank Chairmen Visclosky, Serrano, Quigley, and Price, and  Chairwomen Kaptur and DeLauro, for outlining those values so clearly in  their appropriations bill, and I urge passage of this minibus.
