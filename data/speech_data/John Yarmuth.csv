John Yarmuth,1.2235201597213743,D," Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act because it is an abomination that the people  who keep me safe cause others to live in fear.  I rise because I was Breonna Taylor's Congressman, and I will  continue to represent her until she gets justice because Breonna  Taylor, when her door was broken down after midnight, wasn't just  killed by one cop, a bad apple, or even three.  I rise because Breonna Taylor was killed by a system, a system that  allowed police to blindly fire 22 shots, killing an unarmed woman in  her home, and says that is not a crime.  I rise because Breonna Taylor's story, though tragic, is not unique.  Because far too often, that system is more interested in shielding  those who perpetrate these atrocities than seeking justice for those it  is meant to serve. And because, while tragedies like Breonna's are not  uncommon, and millions must live in fear for their lives every single  day--I am not one of them. People who look like me are not among them.  I rise because this system is far too badly broken for Band-Aid  solutions. And this bill, the most dramatic rethinking of policing ever  to come before the United States Congress, is a much-needed and long- overdue step. And every day we delay will cost more lives.  I rise because hundreds of thousands have risen up and made their  voices heard and shown me the way.  And most importantly, I rise because Black lives matter.    "
