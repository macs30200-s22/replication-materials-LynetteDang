Mark Warner,0.3398280143737793,D," Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to a group  of veterans who served this country decades ago but who continue to  suffer to this day as a result of their service. I am talking about  hundreds of thousands of veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange  during their service.  From 1962 to 1975, the United States sprayed over 20 million gallons  of Agent Orange across Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Millions of our  servicemembers, not to mention millions of Vietnamese civilians, were  exposed. Fifty years later, hundreds of thousands of Vietnam-era  veterans are still paying the price.  From the start, the Federal Government has tried to slow-walk  attempts to cover the care these veterans earned. It wasn't until 1991  that the VA recognized the connection between Agent Orange exposure and  several diseases and conditions, finally allowing these veterans to  seek treatment from the VA. Currently, the list of conditions at the VA  stands at 14, but science tells us the list is far from complete.  In 2017, then-Veterans Affairs Secretary Shulkin called for three  more conditions to be added to the list: bladder cancer, underactive  thyroid, and Parkinson's-like symptoms. Now, these weren't randomly  chosen. They were conditions found by the National Academy of Science  to be connected to Agent Orange exposure.  The science was there. The VA was there. Yet this White House and its  OMB Director, Mick Mulvaney, have blocked this effort to expand the  list of conditions.  Do you know what the deciding factor was? It wasn't scientific  evidence. It wasn't the advice of VA doctors. No, the White House  decided that the cost of providing care to 83,000 veterans suffering  from these conditions was just too high, and for that this  administration turned its back on 83,000 veterans who answered the call  to serve.  Unfortunately, this is just the latest example of the Federal  Government trying to avoid paying for the care of men and women our  Nation sent to war. My office hears regularly from veterans facing  problems like prostate cancer, Parkinson's, and other conditions that  have been linked to Agent Orange. Time and again, we hear how the VA  tries to deny benefits on the basis of a technicality. This is just not  right. Unfortunately, this administration is far from the first to  ignore evidence about Agent Orange in order to save a few bucks.  I want to share a few stories from my State of Virginia, where more  than 204,000 Vietnam veterans currently call home. In many cases,  veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange have been fighting multiple  administrations to get these life-or-death benefits--benefits they  earned by their service decades ago.  One veteran, William Badgett of Hampton, VA, was exposed to Agent  Orange during his service in Vietnam with the Army. He was in the 101st  Airborne, 1st Cavalry, where he served as a helicopter mechanic and  supply sergeant. He has been diagnosed with a number of health  conditions, including enlarged prostate, osteoporosis, kidney disease,  and hardened arteries, none of which are on the VA's presumptive list.  While the VA considers prostate cancer to be on the list, Mr.  Badgett's enlarged prostate is not presumed by the VA to be connected  to his exposure to Agent Orange simply because it is not cancer.  Another example: Sam Harvey from Newport News, VA, was exposed to  Agent Orange during the Vietnam war. He served in the U.S. Navy from  1966 to 1970 aboard the USS Constellation. He was diagnosed with  aggressive prostate cancer. Yet, with prostate cancer being on the  presumptive list, he struggled to get VA approval for the treatment he  needs.  Finally, I want to talk about Dorman Watts from North Chesterfield,  VA. He suffered for years to get the disability rating from the VA that  will qualify him for the comprehensive care from the VA. He has  prostate cancer and heart disease and is currently undergoing radiation  treatment from a private provider. This is unacceptable.  That is why I am glad Congress included important accountability  measures as part of the Defense appropriations legislation we passed  this week. Finally, after years of reluctance, years of ignoring the  science, these veterans are going to get some of the answers about the  conditions that have resulted from their service.  There is more than enough evidence to expand the list of Agent  Orange-related conditions. We should be thanking these veterans for  their service, not nickel-and-diming them. I urge my colleagues to  listen to the veterans in their States, and I urge the White House to  let the VA provide these veterans with the benefits they have earned.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    "
