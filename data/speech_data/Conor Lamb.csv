Conor Lamb,2.749350070953369,D," Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, for the last 2\\1/2\\ years, I have been a  member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs; and during that  time, one of the things I have seen is the way that our veterans  service organizations, particularly the American Legion, the VFW, the  Vietnam Veterans of America, but several others, too, play an essential  role in connecting all of the good things that we are trying to do with  government programs with the people who actually need to benefit from  them and take advantage of them.  So often in government, we have a hard time getting our ideas and our  solutions beyond the walls of the Federal office building and into the  communities and streets and homes where we want them to be, and these  organizations are very, very good at doing that.  So I want to thank my colleague, Republican Representative Van Taylor  from Texas, for partnering with me on these amendments to bring in  these veterans service organizations as part of signing people up and  enrolling them in apprenticeship programs so that the veterans who are  out there who are most in need of up-skilling or creating a new career  path can actually find out about these opportunities and take advantage  of them.  There is probably no one in America more qualified and a better bet  for this investment than a veteran. On-the-job training is what we do.  These people have the patience and discipline to complete these  programs and make our entire workforce stronger and better off, and I  know that the veterans service organizations will help us get there.
