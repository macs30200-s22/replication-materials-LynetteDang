Lauren Underwood,2.442605495452881,D," Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, it has been 6 months since the President  signed coronavirus relief legislation. Since then, the House has passed  two comprehensive bills to deliver urgently needed relief. Senate  Republicans and the Trump administration need to do the same.  Northern Illinoisans are doing everything they can to be safe and  provide for their families, but this is a once-in-a-century pandemic  and no community can weather this alone. We must come together.  America is nearing a million new cases a week. Families are  struggling and facing an uncertain future. Small businesses are closing  their doors. Children are going hungry.  If we, as a Congress do not act now, folks at home will be forced to  face their toughest winter yet, without the support they need as human  beings and deserve as Americans.  Our communities are working together to help mitigate the spread of  this virus. Now Congress must work together to pass a robust, evidence- based relief package. The American people are doing everything they  can. Congress must do so, too.    "
