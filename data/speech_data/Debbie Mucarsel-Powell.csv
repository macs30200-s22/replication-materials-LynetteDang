Debbie Mucarsel-Powell,0.8082436919212341,D," Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my  amendment to the Strength in Diversity Act, and I am very grateful to  Representative Fudge for allowing me to introduce this amendment, a  critical piece of legislation to begin reversing decades of  resegregation in our schools.  In Florida, nearly 63 percent of students are from minority  communities, compared to only 30 percent of teachers. This disparity is  exacerbating racial and socioeconomic achievement gaps.  A teacher in my district, Sharon Rivers, emphasized the importance of  diversity in the classroom, saying: ``Culture diversity in the  classroom is essential in helping us recognize, respect, and welcome  the many differences across the district. It is imperative that we  allow our understanding of our differences to build a bridge of respect  for one another.''  I couldn't agree more, and my amendment would build upon that effort  by increasing the diversity of our teaching workforce. Teachers of  color can provide more culturally relevant education and better  understand the situations their students of color are facing, helping  develop stronger student-teacher relationships.  Our teachers should reflect our communities and our schools. Recent  studies show that increased teacher diversity results in better  achievement scores, lower levels of disciplinary action, and reduced  dropout rates. In fact, a Florida study showed that Black students had  higher reading and math scores when taught by Black teachers.  Unfortunately, in most States, as the proportion of students of color  grows, the number of minority teachers is not keeping pace. We must do  more to ensure that all students, regardless of their race or  background, are set up for success.  I urge everyone to vote to pass my amendment.    "
