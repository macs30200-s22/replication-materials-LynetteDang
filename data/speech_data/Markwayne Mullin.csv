Markwayne Mullin,0.1708884835243225,R," Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of ', H.R. 5541, "", the  Tribal Power Act.  As the only Native American that serves on the Energy and Commerce  Committee and one who has lived in Indian Country my entire life, this  bill is extremely important to Tribes. It can strategically help us  receive capital that we need to become energy efficient and enhance our  energy infrastructure.  I have long been a supporter of the economic benefits American energy  brings to our communities. As sovereign nations, Tribes should have the  ability to choose and deploy this kind of energy and the best kind of  energy that works for them. I am proud to be a colead in this very  important issue.  Now, with the remainder of my time, Mr. Speaker, I would like to take  a second and recognize our good leader and a friend that we are going  to lose here in Chairman Walden.  Our committee is better because of your leadership. Anybody who can  put up with my attitude and my great personality and still stay calm  and effectively lead our committee, I just want to tell you that shows  a good leader. It shows somebody I would love to follow and someone I  have enjoyed being able to follow.  Since my time in Congress, you have been a friend and a mentor, one  that I can always count on to give the right advice--not necessarily  something I always wanted to hear, but the right advice. And, as I said  before, that is the character of a good leader.  So, for your 22 years of service, and as someone who only got to  serve with you for 8 of those years, it has been a great honor, and you  will be missed.    "
