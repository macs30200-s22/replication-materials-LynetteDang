Barry Loudermilk,0.2770108878612518,R," Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, I thank our ranking member for not  only yielding, but his fine leadership in this committee.  I also appreciate my colleague, Mr. Gottheimer, sponsor of this  legislation. I appreciate his leadership on this, and I truly believe  he did work very hard in a bipartisan manner to try to come to an  agreement. And unfortunately, we just weren't able to close that gap.  And I hope that going forward we will be able to do that, because this  is something that we do support on this side with the certain  constraints to protect the consumers' identity.  One of my major concerns on this is cybersecurity. As was spoken  about earlier, the bill would create an online portal for consumers to  access their credit reports from all three major credit bureaus in one  place. The idea is a good idea, and very worth discussing and very  worth pursuing. But in its current state, it would be a massive amount  of sensitive data in one place, so it must be done in a way that is  cybersecure to make sure that the information doesn't lead to more  fraud and more identity theft.  As someone who has spent many years in the IT sector, as I know my  good colleague, Mr. Gottheimer, has as well, I am very concerned about  the potential of breaches of this portal.  We all remember the 2017 Equifax data breach that exposed the  financial information of millions of Americans, and the last thing we  should be doing is increasing the chance of that kind of event  happening again. But this bill has the potential to do that very thing  because it does not include robust cybersecurity protections to make  sure the information on the portal is secure.  {time} 1545  Another worthy goal of the bill is to make it easier for consumers to  dispute errors in their credit reports. But the bill allows consumers  to repeatedly dispute the same information on their credit reports,  even if it is found to be accurate, which would lead to unnecessary and  frivolous disputes.  Another significant concern I have with this bill is that it would  expand the authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The  CFPB is an unaccountable regulatory agency that took many rogue actions  under the previous administration.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle know that expanding the  CFPB's power is a nonstarter for Republicans; therefore, I cannot  support this bill. I ask my colleagues to oppose this bill.
