John Curtis,1.2218332290649414,R," Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member  Bishop for helping us move this bill along. Special thanks to my  cosponsor, who shares a not-so-unique problem in our districts of  wildfires and fighting those.  Mr. Speaker, I obviously rise in support of the AIR Safety Act, which  will examine risks and effects of drone incursions on wildland  firefighting.  In the last few years, Utah and the rest of the West have been  battling extreme wildfires. Our Federal land managers and State and  local partners need every tool available to them to put these fires  out.  When a wildfire breaks out, the FAA sets up a temporary flight  restriction, or TFR, around the perimeter to allow aerial firefighters  full access to the fire.  Unfortunately, when people ignore these TFRs and fly their drones  around the fire, fire management must ground their own drones and  helicopters until the area is clear. This wastes valuable time and  money, putting structures and, most importantly, lives at risk.  The AIR Safety Act will direct the Forest Service, Bureau of Land  Management, FAA, and State forestry partners to examine these risks and  come up with ways to stop future problems.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    "
