John Carter,0.0795210897922515,R," Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about division D of "", H.R. 7608, "", the  Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill for  fiscal year 2021.  Throughout my time in Congress, I have focused on three things:  soldiers, their families, and veterans. It is an honor to serve as the  ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee that has their  interests in the forefront of our minds.  Overall, I strongly support the funding provided for military  construction projects. I am pleased the bill includes funding for the  services' unfunded priorities: privatized military housing, resilient  and energy-efficient installations, and cleanup of contaminated sites.  On a bipartisan basis, the bill increases funding for women veterans,  mental health and homeless programs, and supports construction of new  VA facilities.  Veterans have earned special attention for their service and  sacrifice. In many ways, this bill helps to fulfill our promises to  them.  However, unfortunately and regretfully, I must express my opposition  to "", H.R. 7608, "". Less than a year ago, we agreed to the 2019 Bipartisan  Budget Act. I believe it is irresponsible to designate some funding as  emergency just to avoid the caps set by that act. This is especially  true since we all acknowledged the growing costs of veterans'  healthcare programs when we agreed to the budget deal.  I recognize the budget realities we face, but we should not unravel  that agreement through this year's appropriations process. I am also  concerned that this bill includes provisions that limit the President's  ability to address the national emergency on our southern border.  Regardless of one's position, the fact remains that cartels and  criminal gangs take advantage of our political disagreements and  continue to flood our Nation with dangerous and illegal drugs and  exploit and traffic men, women, and children seeking a better life.  This is unacceptable.  While I oppose the final passage of the bill, I believe that the  committee can continue to work together to fund programs important to  soldiers, their families, and veterans in a responsible manner.  In closing, I would like to thank my subcommittee chairwoman, Ms.  Wasserman Schultz, for her dedication to our subcommittee and its  responsibilities. Also, I want to thank Chairwoman Lowey for her  service and leadership in this Congress, and I want to thank Ranking  Member Granger for her support and commitment to enacting responsible  spending bills.
