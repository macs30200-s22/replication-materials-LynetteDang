Lindsey Graham,1.9787240028381348,R," Mr. GRAHAM. Johnny, at some point, this has to be painful for you.  Very few people get together at their own funerals.  What we are trying to say is that we like you. You are a breath of  fresh air in a body that has a hard time agreeing on much. I have known  you since I got into politics. I served in the House with you, and I  have served in the Senate with you. I have traveled the world with you.  I have played golf with you. I have had dinner with you. I have gotten  to know your family.  To sum it up, when it comes to being a U.S. Senator, Johnny Isakson  has become the gold standard.  God bless you.  I yield the floor.    "
