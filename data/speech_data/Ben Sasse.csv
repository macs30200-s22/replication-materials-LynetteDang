Ben Sasse,0.1676229983568191,R," Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, farmers and ranchers are in a tough spot.  There are a lot of families who are on the edge of bankruptcy in my  State and in ag country more broadly. As we get closer to Christmas and  to the new year without having a trade deal with Canada and Mexico, the  situation is getting bleaker.  Let's be blunt about this. By needlessly stonewalling the USMCA trade  agreement, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats are taking  Nebraska's agriculture hostage. This is petty, stupid politics at its  worst.  The USMCA trade deal is a free-trade win for our farmers and  ranchers, and they desperately need this win right now. With hard work  and grit, Nebraskans have cultivated one of the most powerful  agricultural economies in the history of the world. We literally feed  the world, and we do it with free trade because we grow so much more  food than we could ever consume. We need export markets, and lots of  people around the world want to be consuming our ag products.  It is pretty simple: Trade with Canada and Mexico is a win-win-win.  In 2018, Mexico and Canada bought more than $40 billion worth of  American agricultural products. The U.S. International Trade Commission  expects the USMCA to increase that trade by more than $33 billion. The  USMCA trade deal is designed to reinforce those partnerships in ways  that make sense for an economy that has changed a lot since NAFTA was  passed in the 1990s.  In the 1990s, ``Seinfeld'' was still on TV; we still watched movies  on VHS tape; and we took our pictures with these things of which the  pages probably don't know--cameras that had film. I will be honest. At  my house, we still watch ``Seinfeld,'' but we have happily moved on  from VHS tapes. My teenage daughters set us up on Hulu streaming, but I  can't make the remote work.  Over the last 20 years, we have seen a massive digital revolutionary  change in nearly every sector of our economy. Farmers are using new  tech to increase our productivity and to get more out of the most  fertile land on God's green Earth than people have ever assumed  possible. The USMCA trade deal makes that kind of basic improvement in  our trading relationships with our neighbors, and we need that in this  rapidly changing, evolving, and developing economy. For example, it  scraps the old rules about importing cars that still have cassette tape  players. Chuck Grassley, apparently, still has a car that has a  cassette tape player, but he is proud of it, so we won't make fun of  him here.  Passing the USMCA would secure long-term stability in our trade  agreements with our partners across North America, and it would also  send a signal to other potential partners around the world that the  United States is open for business. We need to bring Japan, the  European Union, and others to the negotiating table, and passing the  USMCA would strengthen our position significantly in setting up those  trade agreements. Time is running out.  If we don't pass the USMCA this year, we are going to send a very  different signal to our potential partners. If Speaker Pelosi and the  House Democrats can't get their act together on the USMCA, they will be  telling the whole world that we may or may not be open for business--it  all depends on short-term political posturing. That is the message they  are sending now, and that is the message that might be cemented if this  calendar year ends without our passing the USMCA. Try running a  convenience store like that, and you will be out of business in a  month.  A lot of folks in San Francisco and New York City may not think much  about beans and corn prices, but every farmer and rancher in Nebraska  is beyond baffled that this no-brainer trade deal hasn't been passed  yet. It is simply in the best long-term interests of everyone involved  in this conversation. This is not something that should be slipping  beyond this year; this is something that should pass now. We should  call the vote on Christmas morning if that is what it takes. The  Congress should not be leaving DC without passing the USMCA.  Time is running out, and we don't want to let our farmers and  ranchers face 2020 with the uncertainty and the confusion they now  feel. These Nebraskans want to do business; they want to trade; and we  want to win.  Congress is the place where Americans deliberate about the long-term  challenges we need to face for the future of our country, but instead  of deliberation, right now what they see when they turn on their TVs or  pick up their newspapers is just vicious partisanship and short-term  posturing. The American people deserve better than this.  The clown show in the House of Representatives shouldn't bring  everything to a grinding halt. It shouldn't stop us from doing right  for farmers and ranchers. The USMCA trade agreement would pass by large  majorities if introduced on the House floor, and I speculate that it  would get between 85 and 90 votes on this floor. Obviously, we can't  take it up until the House votes. The House would pass it with a big  majority. That means only Nancy Pelosi stands in the way of USMCA's  certainty for the world's greatest producers. Everyone knows this, and  Speaker Pelosi should be scheduling the vote.  We have only 28 days left in 2019, but that is plenty of time to vote  on the USMCA. That is plenty of time to get a win for our farmers and  ranchers.  Speaker Pelosi, please schedule the vote.
