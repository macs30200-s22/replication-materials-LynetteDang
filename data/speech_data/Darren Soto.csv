Darren Soto,1.462057113647461,D," Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, there is a mix of hope and despair in central  Florida.  This week, the first vaccines arrived to help protect our healthcare  professionals. But unemployment remains around 10 percent; food banks  lay bare; many are behind on rent; and coronavirus cases continue to  rise.  The message is clear in both Florida and across our Nation: Americans  need help.  It is time for this Congress to come together and pass meaningful  coronavirus emergency relief to defeat the virus; to help small  businesses and the unemployed; and to ensure food, housing, and direct  stimulus checks for our constituents.  The solution is within our grasp. We just need to come together this  week to get the job done.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues: Don't be an Ebenezer  Scrooge. Embrace the Christmas spirit. Join me and vote ``yes.''    "
