Gwen Moore,0.5890492796897888,D," Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of the ALS  Disability Insurance Access Act. This important bill eliminates the  mandatory five-month waiting period for patients with ALS seeking to  access the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits they  earned.  The waiting period creates an undue financial burden when ALS  patients are already facing enormous financial stress. But while we act  today to alleviate the hardship created by this waiting period for ALS  patients, Congress must extend similar relief to other beneficiaries  who are equally deserving.  What sense does it make to have require SSDI beneficiaries to endure  a five-month waiting period after they have been determined eligible  for their earned SSDI benefits? This requirement creates an unnecessary  delay for some of our nation's most vulnerable.  We must ensure that all individuals who qualify for SSDI can access  the benefits for which they have already qualified without undue delay.  I urge my colleagues to not only support the ALS Disability Insurance  Access Act, but to end the waiting period for all SSDI beneficiaries.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, "", S. 578, '.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
