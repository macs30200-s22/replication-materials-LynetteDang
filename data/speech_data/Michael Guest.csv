Michael Guest,1.0236207246780396,R," Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, since the outbreak of the coronavirus in the  United States, the promise of the development of a vaccine has allowed  Americans to remain optimistic in the midst of tragedy. Now, after  months of sacrifice, the coronavirus vaccine has been found. This  accomplishment would not have been possible without the hard work of  scientists working around the world and the support by the tremendous  feat of government innovation known as Operation Warp Speed.  Now, following the discovery of the vaccine, we must focus on the  production and distribution of the vaccine to the American people and  to those across the globe.  Public officials are optimistic that distribution of the vaccine  could begin in a matter of weeks, a massive jump forward in the process  to rid the world of this dangerous virus. This production of millions  of dosages of vaccine will not happen overnight, but thanks to  Operation Warp Speed and the Trump administration, the vaccine will  reach vulnerable Americans faster than anticipated, saving thousands of  lives in the process.  Mr. Speaker, I thank all who helped advance this extraordinary  accomplishment.    "
