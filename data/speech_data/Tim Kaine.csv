Tim Kaine,0.423911988735199,D," Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Protecting  Critical Services for Mothers and Babies Act, with my colleague Senator  Perdue. Enacting this bill will help ensure that mothers and infants  across the country continue to receive access to important health  programs.  About 700 women die each year in the United States from complications  during or after pregnancy, a problem that disproportionately affects  Black and American Indian/Alaskan Native women. In the face of these  challenges, organizations like March of Dimes provide services that  disseminate health information to pregnant women and mothers and  support care for premature and ill infants.  Inflexible funding rules and historically low interest rates have  combined to result in a sharp increase in March of Dimes' pension  funding obligations next year. This Act will extend more flexible rules  to organizations that have a long track record of serving maternal and  infant health needs. These rules, already offered to other  organizations, will continue to protect plan participants while also  smoothing out pension funding obligations. This change will ensure that  resources are not diverted away from important maternal and infant  health programs.    "
