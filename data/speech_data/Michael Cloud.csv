Michael Cloud,0.3385578691959381,R," Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Mrs.  Susan Day, a beloved teacher in the Corpus Christi community who passed  away on October 5, 2020.  Mrs. Day was a passionate and dedicated educator at Calallen High  School who retired this past May after 36 years of service to our  community. Students and parents alike described her as devoted,  energetic, and inspiring. She would challenge her students with quality  education while encouraging them with her enthusiasm and charm.  The students of Calallen High School tell stories of the many  experiences she gave them, including coaching the Calallen Challenge  Team to three wins in the local TV quiz show.  The English department chose to recognize her with a plaque declaring  the English hallway, a place she had spent so much time with her  students, to be the Susan Day Hallway.  Susan Day was an amazing member of our community who has touched the  lives of hundreds of students, parents, and teachers.  I offer my condolences to her family, friends, and students as they  grieve the loss of a great woman. She will be fondly remembered by all  for the investment and impact she has made in the lives of so many  students.    "
