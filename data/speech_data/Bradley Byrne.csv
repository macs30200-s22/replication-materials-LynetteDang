Bradley Byrne,0.2733181715011596,R," Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. My  grandparents were from Indiana, and the gentlewoman from Indiana  represents her State well, and I have appreciated our relationship.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give my farewell speech to this House,  and I am going to surprise some people by saying that I rise today with  hope and optimism. I know that is unusual because there are people on  both sides of the House that want to say this country is in a bad place  and heading in the wrong direction.  I believe that view ignores two very important things. One is our  history, and the other is what I hear the people of America telling us.  Several years ago, a number of us from the Senate and the House, both  parties, had the privilege of spending an evening at the Library of  Congress with the noted American history writer David McCullough. At  the end of the evening, the moderator turned to him and said: What  parting words do you have for these Members of Congress?  And he said: I think if the people of America knew their history  better, they would be more hopeful, they would be more optimistic.  I have been listening to the people of my district for the last 7  years. When I was listening to them, I had no preconceived notions  about what they thought, and, buddy, they told me. And the American  people, through elections, have told us, too. And the great thing about  our elections is there are no filters.  If you go back and look at the history of this country, you will see  some notable things. One is that this country was founded by people who  believed in principles, in morals, and values that defined who we are.  They took a tremendous risk in fighting the most powerful military  nation in the world, Great Britain, and they did it after declaring  something very important, not just that they were declaring  independence, but the reasons for why they were doing it.  That Congress was the Second Continental Congress. The First  Continental Congress, which met in 1774, is the forerunner to this  House, a group of people elected to represent the people of this  country. It is a notion as old as the creation of Parliament and the  House of Commons of England, something that was their heritage.  Now, they took a great risk because they felt they faced a great  risk. They had been told when those colonies were founded that they  would have the same rights as all English people, and they found after  the French and Indian war that that wasn't true, that those rights were  going to be taken from them, and they were willing to fight for those  rights.  Now, Mr. Speaker, let me say this very clearly. They didn't come into  this with clean hands. When the Europeans came to this continent, this  was not a new world. This was an old world. There was a civilization  already here that had been here for thousands of years. And between our  germs, which they had no defense against, and other things worse than  that, we essentially took this land from them.  In 1619, European slave traders brought the first slave to this  country. So when they went into that fight with the British, they  didn't have clean hands. But societies are complex things, and because  they didn't have clean hands didn't mean they didn't have clean hearts.  And they did.  They waged an incredible war for 5 years against this great military  power and won. And they won because of what they stood on. Go back and  look at the Declaration of Independence. One sentence in there really  says it all: ``We hold these truths. . . . `'  Truths, absolutes, not something you get to change your mind about.  ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created  equal. . . . `'  Yes, I know they used the word ``men,'' but the principle of equality  was in there. It was in what they were standing on. And they said we  were created equal, which means we had a Creator. And they go on in the  very next phrase and they say: ``We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their  Creator. . . . `'  They were gifted. Endowed means gifted. They were gifted by their  Creator, by God himself with certain unalienable rights, rights that  can't be taken away from them. And that [["", Page , H7032, ] among these rights are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And  that governments are instituted among men to secure those very  liberties, `` . . . deriving their just powers from the consent of the  governed.''  We need to reread that sentence over and over again. Government  doesn't exist for the politicians. Government exists to secure rights,  and the power we have is the power the people give us.  Now, I know very well that we had to follow up that desperate war and  that declaration by creating a Constitution, the Constitution we are  under today. Sadly, it is a Constitution I fear too many people,  including too many people in power, don't know much about. Because the  purpose of the Constitution was not only to create a government that  had enough power to do what needed to be done for the things that are  listed in the preamble of the Constitution, it also put limits on that  government. And some of us act as if there are no limits on this  government.  And our Founders knew because they had to fight against a tyrannical  central government that there needed to be limits on government. Those  same English rights that they had inherited had been secured because  people, for hundreds of years, had to fight back against British kings  that wanted to take power and use it against the people.  {time} 2015  People lost their lives. There was great suffering, as there was in  our Revolution, because tyrannical central governments don't give their  power back easily, they don't give them back without a fight. That  fight continued in the Constitution.  The Bill of Rights, which was adopted by this House in the very first  Congress under the leadership of James Madison, as he said in his  speech to the House when he introduced the Bill of Rights, he said,  this is all about making sure that we take away from this powerful  government we have created any notion that they can trample on certain  specific rights, and they laid them out. And in a couple years, all the  States necessary ratified those amendments, and they are part of the  fundamental law of this country, although sometimes we act like they  are not.  I have listened, by the way, to some of the debates about what rights  we have under the Free Exercise Clause. The Free Exercise Clause is in  the First Amendment to the Constitution, and it says, Congress can't  make any law that establishes a religion or infringes upon the free  exercise of that religion; exercise, action. We have a right to freely  exercise our religion, and we need to remember that fundamental right  along with the others.  Now, that was our founding: the Declaration of Independence, the War  for Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights. That was our  founding, not 1619. And we need to remember the principles of our  founding, because they are central to who we are as people.  Now, over the course of the 19th century, we were invaded by Great  Britain, the Capitol Building here was burned, the White House was  burned. We could have given up, but we didn't, because that is not who  we are.  We not only survived, we fought on and built this great country so  that by 1860, we not only bordered on the Atlantic Ocean, we bordered  on the Pacific Ocean and we bordered on the Rio Grande. We grew by  leaps and bounds.  Then in 1861, we entered another tragedy, because the people that put  that Constitution together failed in at least one critical regard: they  failed to address the issue of slavery, and we fought a terrible Civil  War that cost the lives of 600,000 Americans to solve a problem that  should have been solved in 1787.  Despite that war, we came back, we ended slavery, we adopted the  Fourteenth Amendment and the Fifteenth Amendment, and we grew as a  Nation throughout the rest of the 19th century.  Finally, in the early 20th century, we did the right thing and gave  women the right to vote. Neither of my grandmothers, as young adult  women with families, could vote. It is amazing that that was true just  that long ago, but it was. But we corrected it, as we always do.  In World War II, this country fought an incredibly difficult world  war on three different continents and beat the most powerful nations in  the world, and at the end of that war, stood as the only real power  left on the Earth.  And we had a choice. We could have walked away, come right back to  our shores and said, we are going back to being the insular country we  have been. We could have also said, we have got more power than  everybody else; we are going to use it against everybody else to make  ourselves wealthy.  We did neither.  We stood up and led the world, and created a rules-based order that  has benefited people all over the world, that has lifted billions of  people out of poverty, that has increased the lifespan of billions of  people, that spread democracy and freedom around the globe, because  that is who we are.  While we were doing that, we were also facing our problems here at  home. Yes, we have problems here at home. We didn't finish the work of  the Civil War. We had to go through a difficult civil rights movement,  and in this House, we adopted the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and in this  House, we adopted the 1965 Voting Rights Act. We did that.  We provided things for the education of the children of this country  they didn't have. We provided things for healthcare in this country  that people didn't have. We provided for clean air and clean water.  We addressed our own problems while we were leading the world,  because that is who we are. We do those things.  Now, I understand that there are people that want to give us a  different version of that history. They want to tell us that we are all  evil from birth, that somehow this country is inherently evil.  That just doesn't square with historic facts.  They want to rewrite history.  The first thing any authoritarian government does is rewrite history  or attempt to do it. The authoritarian wannabes in this country are  trying to rewrite our history, and they want to do that to pursue a  radical agenda that doesn't match up with what the American people  want.  They try to call themselves Progressives. That is not progressive.  Wanting a powerful central government is regressive. That is regressing  back to what we rebelled against in 1776.  They are not progressive. They are Socialists. They are at least  honest in saying that. But they are not progressive. It is regressive.  Let me tell you what I hear the American people say in my district  and around this country. They are saying this: We Americans aren't  evil. We are and have been a force for good here and around the world.  We aren't Socialists. We don't want a powerful, overreaching central  government.  We don't want Medicare for all, where the government makes decisions  for us and our doctors, and rations when and how we get our healthcare.  We believe our healthcare system is the best in the world, and we want  to keep it that way, but we also want to assure that everyone in this  country has real access to it.  We don't want a Green New Deal, which jacks up our utility bills,  saps our economic competitiveness, and destroys jobs.  We don't want to defund the police. In fact, we think spending on  public safety is a good thing. We value our law enforcement officers  and we grieve when one is killed, as dozens are every year.  We want our government to defend our shores and interests and protect  us here at home. We rely upon the men and women wearing our uniform to  do that, and we want our government to take care of them.  I have gotten the chance to travel all over the world to see our men  and women in uniform, many of them in harm's way, and I am so proud of  them. And like most Americans, I want to make sure we are doing the  right thing by them.  We want to make sure that there is opportunity in this country for  everyone. Everyone. Don't leave anybody out. We want everybody to be  able to take advantage of all that this Nation has to offer. And to  achieve that goal, we need quality education for everybody in this  country, and not just for the privileged.  It shouldn't be the case that you get one caliber of education  because of [["", Page , H7033, ] where you live, one type of education, one quality of education, and a  worse one if you live in some other place. We should give everybody the  freedom to have quality education so that they can take advantage of  those opportunities.  We want justice for everyone. Everyone. Because injustice to anyone  is injustice to us all.  We want our air and water to be clean.  We want to continue to be the economic leader of the world.  Let me stop and say a word about China.  The greatest external threat to this country is China; not the  Chinese people, but the Communist Party that runs China. They seek to  become the only power in the world; not a power, the only power. And  they will do anything--anything. They will stop at nothing to get it.  It is past time for us to wake up and understand the threat that they  are, not just to us, but to the entire world and that rules-based order  we created after World War II.  And, Mr. Speaker, we the American people are tired of being divided,  divided by our region. Since when is it okay for the coasts to look  down on the other parts of the country?  We don't want to be divided by race. People aren't defined by the  color of their skin, they are not defined by their ethnicity, they are  not defined by their national origin. That is anti-American to think  that way. We should come together over that.  We don't want to be divided by our gender.  We don't want to be divided by religion. Whether you have got a  religion or not, we don't want to be divided by it.  We don't want to be divided by generation, the young versus the old.  It has always been that the old handed something valuable to the next  generation. That is what we should be about.  That division in our country is the greatest internal threat we have  got. And I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, it is the greatest threat of  all, because there is nothing that this great Nation can't accomplish  when we are united, when we are e pluribus unum, out of many, one.  That is who America is, that is who the American people want us to  be, and that is the great challenge before this House.  I have had a great experience here in Congress. I have met some  wonderful people. I have had the privilege of serving on the House  Armed Services Committee, the Education and Labor Committee, and the  Rules Committee. I have seen a lot of important things be done here and  be done right.  The best legislation passed in this House is bipartisan legislation.  The worst legislation is almost always partisan legislation. Usually it  doesn't make it across the finish line, by the way.  Our ability to work together should be what we should all be striving  for in this House, and I hope the House to follow will do that.  Mr. Speaker, before I take my leave, I want to say a few things.  I want to thank the many Members of this House who have befriended me  and helped me on both sides of the aisle. I particularly want to thank  my fellow colleagues in the Alabama delegation. They have been a great  family to be a part of.  I want to thank the staff. The staff of this House is amazing, so  very helpful, so very competent, and we just couldn't get our jobs down  without you.  I want to thank the good people of southwest Alabama. They gave me  the great privilege of being here to represent them as their only  representative. What an honor that has been. I hope and pray that I  have fulfilled the trust that they put in me, because they are my  bosses.  I want to thank my many supporters who time and time again helped me,  and sometimes it wasn't so easy to do what they had to do.  I want to thank my office staff here in Washington and the district.  They made me look good every day, and I could not have done what I have  done without them. So to all of my staff, present and former, thank you  for what you have done for me.  And I want to thank my long-suffering family. You know, they have  loved me and they supported me, even when I wasn't so lovable and even  when it wasn't so easy to support me. I could not have done it without  them.  So to my son Patrick, his wife, Carolyn, my grandchildren MacGuire  and Ann Roberts; my daughter Kathleen and her husband, Steve, and son,  Cooper; my daughter Laura, her husband, Lieutenant Commander Stephen  Prugh, now presently at the Pentagon; my son Colin; and most of all, I  want to thank my wife, Rebecca.  You know, these are hard positions and it is really hard to be the  spouse of somebody in these positions, and Rebecca has done a  tremendous job in supporting me in every way you could ask. She is  truly the love of my life for 40 years now, and I want to thank her for  all that she has done for me in all those 40 years, but particularly  these last 7 years.  And now, Mr. Speaker, I say farewell to this House. God bless you  all, and God bless the United States of America.    "
