Colin Allred,0.1708884835243225,D," Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I want to speak to the people of north  Texas, many of whom are under Stay Home, Stay Safe orders from smart  leaders like Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins and Dallas Mayor Eric  Johnson.  I know many of you are frightened. I have heard from many of you who  are worried about your family's health, your job, and your business. I  want you to know that we are on your side. We are with you. We will not  let this great country fail. We will defeat this virus in a way that  leaves no one behind.  We should follow the examples of our brave first responders. Every  American owes them a debt of gratitude. But we can best honor their  service by staying home, if you can, and following the orders that have  been issued.    "
