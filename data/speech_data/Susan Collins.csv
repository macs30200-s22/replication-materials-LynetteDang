Susan Collins,1.3333159685134888,R," Mr. COLLINS of New York. Madam Speaker, today I rise to commemorate  the 100th anniversary of Boy Scout Troop 578, one of the oldest troops  in our Nation.  Troop 578 was chartered on September 11, 1919, by the First Church of  Evans in Derby, New York. Historically, they were known as Troop 78,  and, unlike any other Boy Scout troop in America, they remained active  during World War II. During that war, these Scouts were official  dispatch bearers, and they collected recycled metals and other goods to  support the war effort.  In the 1950s, redistricting changes required the troop to add a  number 5 to the 78, making them Troop 578, as they are known today.  As an Eagle Scout myself, I am proud to honor Troop 578 as they  continue to be an important part of the western New York community and  Scouting history. I wish Troop 578 many more active years of Scouting. [[', Page , H7587, ]      "
