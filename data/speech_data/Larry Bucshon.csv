Larry Bucshon,0.9918940663337708,R," Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Walden) for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege to call Greg Walden a  colleague and friend. His time as chairman of the House Energy and  Commerce Committee is another chapter of accomplishment and success in  the committee's storied history.  As chairman, Greg approached every issue before the committee with  his eye on achieving results for the American people. That is why we  are here. He strove to reach across the political divide, because he  understood, and still does, our work on behalf of the American people  is far too important to always be derailed by needless partisanship. Of  course, we will have our squabbles back and forth, but at the end of  the day, it is about the American people, and Greg understands that.  From the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act to RAY BAUM'S Act,  as well as too numerous bills signed into law to even list here, Greg's  leadership of the Energy and Commerce Committee produced important  legislation that is, today, making a difference in the lives of the  American people.  Mr. Speaker, I want to personally thank Greg for taking the time to  bring me in and ask for my professional medical diagnosis of many major  healthcare-related issues or other pieces of legislation before the  committee.  I know at times we doctors can tell you things you don't want to  hear--and quit laughing--but Greg always listened intently and worked  with me to help find a cure, so to speak, or a remedy, and for that, I  will always be appreciative.  Greg, your wisdom, charisma, and unflappable leadership will be  greatly missed in the 117th Congress.  I wish you and Mylene the best as you both begin this new chapter of  your lives, and I look forward to continuing to call you friend.  {time} 1330    "
