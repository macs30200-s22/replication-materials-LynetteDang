Charles Fleischmann,0.237250342965126,R," Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Before I begin, I wish to convey my warm thoughts and sentiments to  Mrs. Lowey from New York, who is chairman of this committee. It has  been a privilege to work with you for almost a decade in my capacity,  and I wish you the best in your future. And I thank you for your  service to this great House.  {time} 1900  Mr. Speaker, tonight, I rise in support of the bill we have before  us, which is the result of months of negotiations on how best to manage  our government's resources in fiscal year 2021 and respond to the COVID  pandemic that has gripped so many of our communities.  Mr. Speaker, as the ranking member of the Homeland Security  Subcommittee, I thank my full committee leader, Ms. Granger, for her  great leadership in pulling this omnibus together. I also thank  Subcommittee Chairwoman Ms. Roybal-Allard from California, along with  Senators Capito and Tester across the hall, for their work and comity  in resolving these difficult and challenging issues. It is a pleasure  to have served with Chairwoman Roybal-Allard in this role.  Mr. Speaker, I think we have a very balanced agreement. We continue  to provide $1.375 billion for border security and funds flexibility for  Immigration and Customs Enforcement to respond to detention needs.  Further, we have significant investments in many of our Nation's  security components, including the great United States Coast Guard,  cybersecurity and infrastructure, and FEMA grants to our States and  localities to respond to disasters.  Further, the bill before us eliminates the riders and policy  provisions contained in the House-reported bill that would have  inhibited the Department of Homeland Security from fulfilling its law  enforcement responsibilities at our borders and in the interior of our  country.  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this package. It is time for  the fiscal year to get underway.  Mr. Speaker, I wish all a happy and healthy new year.    "
