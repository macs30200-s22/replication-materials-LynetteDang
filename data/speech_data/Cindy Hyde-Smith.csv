Cindy Hyde-Smith,0.1192729994654655,R," Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam President, today I rise for the opportunity to  commend Senator Johnny Isakson on his retirement from the U.S. Senate.  I am a relatively new Member to the Senate, but I think we all  remember the first time we ever walked onto the Senate floor. I know I  certainly do because that is the day I met Senator Johnny Isakson.  With both of us being from the South, I knew we would probably have a  lot in common, a similar view on life, and a heart for the South, but  it didn't take me long to learn that Johnny has a universal heart.  I am guilty of the expression, ``Nothing is special until you make it  special.'' Johnny has such a generous gift of making things special. He  has the gift of making everyone around him feel special. His heart and  his attitude sees the best in people and yet goes further to let them  know how much they mean to him.  He exemplifies being a leader, an encourager, and an investor of  people. He is never too busy to ask how you are doing or to ask about  your family. Common courtesy sometimes isn't always that common  anymore, but I assure you it is with Johnny Isakson.  His brilliance is unquestionable. His ability to articulate what is  important to him is just simply amazing. He can deliver a message that  not only expresses his concern but also has answers and solutions based  on his experience and his tremendous wisdom.  He is the gentle calm in a tremendous storm. He has the words of  wisdom when so many are bewildered. He is the guiding light in the  darkest times. He provides the needed laugh in times of tension and the  voice of reason in times of uncertainty. His love is deep, and his  compassion is true.  He knows how to be a friend. He was a born leader and has the ability  to capture opportunities and turn them into successes. My world has  been enhanced and enriched by this wonderful and precious human being.  Johnny learned a long time ago that the joy of living comes in  giving. You know when a person has in his heart that joy, that wasn't  put there by the world.  When I think about the true statesmen I have met in my brief time in  the Senate, I will certainly have ``Georgia on My Mind.''  Thank you.    "
