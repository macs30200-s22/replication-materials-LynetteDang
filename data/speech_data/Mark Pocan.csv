Mark Pocan,0.7891302704811096,D," Mr. POCAN. Madam Speaker, this President is on a warpath to destroy  the Postal Service and, through that, our elections.  After months of hearing this President, and now Republican Members of  Congress, spread conspiracy theories and misinformation about voting by  mail, he has made GOP megadonor Louis DeJoy his new chief of chaos in  voter suppression.  In an attack on the Postal Service, DeJoy has removed mail processing  equipment, collection boxes, and cut back on overtime. Ninety  Democrats, led by Congresswoman Katherine Clark and me, already  demanded his immediate removal.  Because, on top of this blatant voter suppression, Trump and DeJoy  are hurting millions who depend on the Postal Service every day:  seniors and veterans waiting for lifesaving medications, families  waiting for paychecks, small businesses with delayed packages whose  very survival is already threatened by COVID-19.  On Thursday, the Progressive Caucus held a hearing and heard from  David Williams, the former vice president of the Postal Service Board  of Directors, who resigned in protest to Trump's actions. What he told  us, unfortunately, shocked no one: that the Postal Service was fully  prepared for mail voting until this administration manufactured an  intentional crisis; that DeJoy wasn't selected by the firm that was  hired to find a new Postmaster General, but he was the only candidate  interviewed and was unqualified to lead the Postal Service; and that  Steve Mnuchin sought intrusive control over core Postal Service  operations and wanted to impose a pricing practice that would ruin the  Postal Service.  This chaos is not the result of a pandemic. This chaos was  manufactured by the administration and is intentional.  That is why Congress is acting today.  We are reversing Louis DeJoy's disastrous actions and providing the  Postal Service with the funding it so desperately needs. We won't let  anyone dismantle our Postal Service. The Postal Service belongs to the  people.  {time} 1045    "
