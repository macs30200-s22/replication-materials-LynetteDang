Steve Womack,0.0099401362240314,R," Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend Rob Woodall for  yielding.  When I was a kid, I couldn't wait for Saturday morning. Saturday  morning in our house, my brothers and sisters, we would get up, and we  couldn't wait to watch our favorite cartoons.  Now, decades later, here I am again, on the floor of the House of  Representatives, watching a cartoon about the only outcome this debate  is going to have today: one of entertainment value, nothing  substantive.  The chairman of the Rules Committee called this a five-alarm fire.  Now that the Democratic Convention has concluded and the Republican  Convention is about to begin, we have a catastrophe.  It is not going to build infrastructure. It is not going to give aid  to people suffering from the pandemic. It is not going to fund the  government by October 1. It is not going to become law.  Just like the previous attempts, my friends on the other side of the  aisle have had to derail a duly-elected President. This, too, will  fail. I urge a ``no'' vote.    "
