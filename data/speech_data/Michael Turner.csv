Michael Turner,0.2106490284204483,R," Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I want to continue our chairman's lauding of  the career of Mac Thornberry, again, over his objections. In my 18  years that I have served in Congress, I can tell you, not only has his  leadership been essential on the Armed Services Committee, but his  time, both as chairman and ranking member, has been incredibly  important. He has served the Nation well.  I want to thank Chairman Smith for his leadership. We have truly a  bipartisan bill in front of us, and it is a result of Mac Thornberry  and Adam Smith, their work to try to ensure that we do put America  first.  Contrary to the prior speaker--before we began to debate this bill,  we heard accusations that this did not put America first. This puts  America first. What is essential about this is that our adversaries are  gaining on our capabilities. They are investing in modernization. They  are investing in capabilities that will threaten our ability to ensure  our safety and our liberty. This bill is about America first.  I would like to highlight a few key issues in this bill.  First, the conference report fully authorizes the administration's  budget request for the National Nuclear Security Administration. These  funds are critical to ensuring our nuclear weapons enterprise remains  safe, secure, and effective going into the future. We have put off  needed investment too long. There is no longer any margin of error or  delay. Now, the NNSA must transform from a culture of sustainment and  maintenance to a culture of development and manufacturing to meet the  nuclear safety environment of the future.  Second, I am pleased that the conference report removes a provision  that would have prohibited the NNSA from conducting necessary testing  and experimentation.  Next, the conference report funds the ground based strategic  deterrent, the replacement for the Minuteman III, which has provided  the Nation with a nuclear security umbrella for half a century.  Transition to the ground-based strategic deterrent will be one of the  most complex projects the Federal Government has ever undertaken.  The bill also continues the progress of Space Force, and the bill  makes serious investments in missile defense by funding the Missile  Defense Agency's highest unfunded priorities. It authorizes funds for  nine SM-3 Block IIA missiles and a new THAAD battery.  The conference report also includes a provision directing the DOD to  collaborate with research centers so that we can bring forward  information on our adversaries and what they are doing.  Mr. Speaker, I encourage everyone to vote for this bill. It is  important for the future and the security of America.    "
