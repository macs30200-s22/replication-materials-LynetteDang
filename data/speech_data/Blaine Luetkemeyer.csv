Blaine Luetkemeyer,0.2286231219768524,R," Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, section 6308 enhances U.S. law  enforcement's ability to access international bank records to help  better ensure financial crimes are investigated. I am supportive of  this new and necessary provision. This new authority allows the  Departments of Treasury and Justice to issue subpoenas requiring  production of records relating to accounts held by banks outside of the  United States. This new authority would create a secondary mechanism  for seeking discovery from foreign banks separate from the Mutual Legal  Assistance Treaties (``MLATs'') or other multilateral or bilateral  agreements the United States currently maintains with many foreign  governments for this purpose. As the Departments of Justice and  Treasury implement Section 6308, I encourage them only to use this new  authority where a foreign bank operates in a jurisdiction as to which  no MLAT or other information-sharing agreement exists or where the  relevant foreign government has not satisfied its obligations under an  MLAT or other information-sharing agreement.  Many foreign countries restrict banks operating in their  jurisdictions from sharing their customers' financial or personally  identifiable information (``PII'). As a result, subpoenas issued under  section 6308 may place foreign banks in the difficult position of  either violating home country law or being in contempt for failure to  comply with a subpoena issued by the United States government. As a  result, I believe it is appropriate for the Departments of Justice and  Treasury to take into consideration conflict of laws situations to  achieve the purposes of Section 6308 while also maintaining a respect  for home country requirements.  Finally, I encourage the Departments of Treasury and Justice to issue  regulations establishing appropriate protocols to ensure that the  authority granted under section 6308 does not supersede or supplant  existing MLATs or other multilateral or bilateral agreements between  the United States and the relevant foreign government that are  available for obtaining records from a foreign bank.
