Jesus Garcia,0.5572408437728882,D," Mr. GARCIA of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of an American legend and aviation pioneer, General Chuck Yeager, who  passed away this past Monday, December 7.  Daring to be the first to break the sound barrier over California's  Mojave Desert, General Yeager achieved aviation history in 1947 and  launched the modern jet age. He did what many thought was impossible,  and he did it over the skies of my district.  But his dedication to our Nation and contribution to aeronautical  sciences was greater than this one crowning achievement. He served in  World War II as a fighter ace, shooting down 13 German planes--5 in one  day.  In 1953, he set a world speed record by flying at nearly 2\\1/2\\ times  the speed of sound.  From commanding the school training astronauts at Edwards Air Force  Base, to flying 127 missions as commander of a fighter wing in Vietnam,  to testing a Russian MiG-15 obtained from a defector, Chuck Yeager's  service to country and advancement of aviation never stopped throughout  his lifetime.  These accomplishments might have seemed unlikely in the beginning.  Possessing only a high school degree and becoming sick riding in his  first military flight as a passenger, he might have seemed an unlikely  milestone maker in military aviation. But, as he said in his memoir:  ``All I know is I worked my tail off learning to learn how to fly, and  worked hard at it all the way.''  As a fighter pilot myself, this is difficult for me to say, but Chuck  Yeager was truly the best fighter pilot this world has seen. Hard work,  determination, bravery, and service made Chuck Yeager a role model and  a uniquely American hero.  May God bless Chuck Yaeger, his family, and the Nation that he  served, and I hope Chuck is up there in Heaven setting more records.    "
