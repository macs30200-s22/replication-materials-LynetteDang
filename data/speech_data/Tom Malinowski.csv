Tom Malinowski,1.759255051612854,D," Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, they condemned Canada for doing exactly  the same thing a few months ago.  I don't believe they expect us to do it. They surely expect us to  condemn them. They surely expect us to slap a few sanctions on their  leadership, as the State Department did today, which I am fine with.  But they do not expect us to use the strength of our society against  the weakness of theirs by opening our doors to Hong Kongers fleeing  persecution, giving them that option that is being denied to them in  Hong Kong itself.  So let's stand by the brave people of Hong Kong. Let's make the  Chinese Communist Party uncomfortable, as this sure will, and let's do  it in the best traditions of America's openness to people seeking  freedom from oppression around the world.
