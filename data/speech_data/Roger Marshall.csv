Roger Marshall,0.6155687570571899,R," Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, this month, after 40 years of service as a  Member of Congress, our senior Senator of Kansas will be moving his  belongings out of his office in the Hart Senate Office Building to a  private library.  To best honor him, I would like to share some of his original wit,  some of the quips for which he is most famous. Number one:  Take your job seriously, but not yourself.  There are no self-made men or women in public service. It   is your family, friends, and staff who have made you what you   are.  Another couple of favorites:  You are only as good as your staff.  It isn't the best possible bill; it is the best bill   possible.  In reference to an opponent who sometimes disagrees with you, he  suggested:  Go smother them with the milk of human kindness.  On his commitment to agriculture, he said:  We live in a troubled and hungry world.  Food security is national security.  When asked about why we need agriculture programs, the Senator once  said:  You can't eat a shoe.  On life, when asked about making a mistake, he suggested that:  You go hunker down and take it like a donkey in a   hailstorm.  He once said:  Remember, when you roll around with pigs, you both get   dirty, but only one of you enjoys it.  On sports, at football games, he often said:  Throw the ball to the tight end. He was wide open.  And, of course, as we all know, the Senator was the unofficial tight  end coach for the ever-optimistic and fighting Kansas State Wildcats.  At a townhall, when a rabid constituent gave a forceful opposing  opinion, he once replied:  I'll mark you down as undecided.  I loved when he referred to Kansas University as that school over by  Baker.  The Senator, once a marine, was always a marine. He was often quoted  saying ``take the hill'' and ``semper fi.''  But my personal favorite:  There are lots of cactuses in the world, but you don't have   to go sit on every one.  When I first meet successful, influential people, people who I have  read about or know of, I have often asked myself: Is there any  substance to this person? Is there character and integrity? What is  truly important to them?  I would like to share, as we have gotten to know Senator Roberts and  his wife, Franki, I have found that their footprints are larger than  their shadows, their hearts are bigger than their words, their love of  this country, their love of Kansas, more than any words I can find to  describe.  Personally, I cannot imagine any memory of Senator Roberts without  thinking of his bride, his South Carolina magnolia blossom, as he often  called her, whom he married some 51 years ago. She is absolutely his  rock, the person I always see standing beside him with adoring eyes.  While occasionally she gives him a gentle nudge, everyone knows she  always has his back.  Laina and I want to personally thank Senator Roberts and Franki, who  have embraced us with hospitality and kindness since arriving ourselves  in Washington, D.C., some 4 years ago. They have shown us what it is to  be an ambassador for our State. From Christmas gatherings at the White  House to farm bill hearings in a barn, they have shown what servant  leadership looks like, representing our State with dignity and grace.  Senator Roberts is the only person in American history to have his  portrait in both the House Agriculture Committee and the Senate  Agriculture Committee hearing rooms.  Senator Roberts has had a hand in writing eight farm bills. He has  been on a Federal congressional agriculture committee for 40 years  running. Some of his greatest accomplishments include those eight farm  bills, and I am going to reference two of them.  The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, which he  was the primary author and chairman, this became known as the Freedom  to Farm bill.  Chairman Roberts has often told the story--I have heard this maybe  once or twice--of sitting on the tongue of the wagon of a farmer in  Dodge City, Kansas, with all of his farm experts, and his good friend,  Leon Torline said: Pat, we all need freedom to farm.  Sure enough, this agriculture policy gave producers the freedom to  plant crops based on market indicators, not Federal Government set- aside policies.  Next, I will reference the first farm bill I participated in, the  Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, on which he was the primary author  as chairman. Probably most notably, this farm bill received more votes  than any farm bill in modern history, with 87 in favor.  I would like to also mention the 2016 National Bioengineered Food  Disclosure Act. This Federal legislation created standards for labeling  food with ingredients derived from biotechnology.  Then his 2000 Agriculture Risk Protection Act reformed national crop  insurance and led to its widespread use today.  Finally, I will mention Senator Roberts was always the leader in bio- agro security legislation. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services  Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, Senator Roberts  chaired the first Senate hearing on the threat to our Nation's food  supply.  I will close with this. Though Senator Roberts will always be known  for his wit, being an entertaining speaker, and a great interview, his  actions and his accomplishments will always speak louder than any of  his words.  He and Franki have been tremendous ambassadors for agriculture, for  Kansas, and for America. They have climbed many mountains, and they  have planted the flag.  Senator Roberts, semper fi. May God richly bless you, Franki, and  your family.    "
