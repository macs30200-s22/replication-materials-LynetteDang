Antonio Delgado,1.755562424659729,D," Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, Mr. Takano, for  yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of "", H.R. 7105, "". This legislation  incorporates two bills I was proud to introduce.  The first bill is my bipartisan Fairness for Local Veteran Cemeteries  Act, an easy bipartisan fix to allow localities to honor our Nation's  veterans.  As the law is currently written, only State-run veteran cemeteries  are eligible for the National Cemetery Administration's Veterans  Cemetery Grants. This cripples counties and States that don't have  State-operated veteran cemeteries, including New York, Florida, Alaska,  and Oregon, where veteran cemeteries are operated by counties or  county-equivalents.  Our bill will ensure counties and localities can use Federal funds to  help run veteran cemeteries.  "", H.R. 7105, "" also incorporates my Improving Benefits for Underserved  Veterans Act, which would require the VA to publish a report on  veterans' benefits, disaggregating by sex or minority group member  status. This is an important step in leveling the playing field for  women and minority veterans.  The men and women of the armed services dedicate their lives to  defending our Nation and its values. I am proud to support this  legislation that helps our Nation provide better care for our veterans  and protect their final resting place.  Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    "
