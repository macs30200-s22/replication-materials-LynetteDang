Steve Watkins,0.1093414947390556,R," Mr. WATKINS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the life and  work of the late Nancy Epoch.  This poster shows a picture of her on the left. On the right, is  college professor Sally Glassman, probably the best tap dance teacher  in Kansas, but that is another speech entirely.  Mrs. Epoch was beloved by all. She was a music teacher, a choral  director, a Chiefs superfan, and a legitimate Broadway talent who then  returned home.  What she really did was that she enabled young and old kids to find  their voice, be bold, and share it with the world.  So, Mrs. Epoch, from the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives  to you in Heaven, first, I thank you for that first Chiefs Super Bowl  victory. I am pretty sure that that was you. We love you, and we miss  you.    "
