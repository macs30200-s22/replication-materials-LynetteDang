Andrew Kim,1.845918655395508,D," Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  resolution and in strong opposition to the rise of hate crimes and acts  of racism toward Americans of Asian descent.  We all know that these are divisive times. They are tough times.  Hateful language, petty name-calling, and acts of violence are not the  way for us to get through these tough times. This resolution allows  Congress to come together to speak with one voice, that hate targeted  at the Asian-American community has no place in this country and must  be condemned.  I am especially proud to speak here today with so many of my AAPI  colleagues. Many of us have been the victims of these hateful and  harmful actions. We have seen firsthand the vitriol of racism. We have  felt the sting of the distrustful look or a harsh word.  I hope you will join me today in acknowledging the impact of racism  and forcefully renouncing it. I hope you will join me here today in  calling on unity and calling out division. And I hope you will join me  here today in passing a resolution that can remind us that even in the  darkest times we are strongest when we reject hate and embrace  America's diversity.    "
