Kevin Cramer,0.2896620035171509,R," Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, before I begin my comments about an  upcoming nominee, I want to say in response to Senator Kennedy that I  agree 100 percent. Thank you.  Nomination of Daniel Mack Traynor  Mr. President, later today the Senate will have the opportunity to  vote on President Trump's second nomination to the U.S. District Court  for North Dakota. My friend, Dan Traynor, has been nominated and we  will be voting on his confirmation to be district judge for our  district.  I have known Dan for a long time. That is why I was honored to  recommend him to the President and pleased when the President nominated  him earlier this year.  Dan received his bachelor's degree from the University of North  Dakota and his jurist doctorate from the University of North Dakota  School of Law. He clerked for the legendary chief justice of the North  Dakota Supreme Court, Gerald VandeWalle, before heading to Devils Lake,  ND, where he joined his family's law firm and where he works today.  Since that time, he has spent a couple of decades in various  capacities, practicing various types of law, including being the  assistant city attorney for Devils Lake. His extensive criminal and  civil experience both as a prosecutor and defender in State and Federal  courts and also in Tribal court are the main qualifications I think he  brings to this important position. Again, I am honored to support him.  He has tried about 80-plus cases to a verdict or judgment or to a  final decision, which I think is very good experience for somebody who  is then going to stand in judgment. In addition, the ABA gave him a  unanimous ``well qualified'' rating. He has also been recognized since  2015 as a ``super lawyer.'' In 2017 he received Martindale-Hubbell's  ``AV Preeminent Rating.''  So Dan's academic record, experience, and qualifications are more  than adequate to be a good district judge. What makes him an exception  is that Dan and his wife Trish, who is an Air Force veteran, are  raising a beautiful family and are what we call pillars of their  community and our State. As for Dan's family, his mom and dad, Jack and  Jane, I know quite well, and they are what we would call legends in  their community and in our State.  The bottom line is that Dan is eminently qualified in every way,  including possessing the character, demeanor, and temperament, as well  as the intellectual capacity, to be an excellent judge. I look forward  to voting for him, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    "
