Todd Young,0.5441849827766418,R," Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my chief of staff,  Pamela Day. Next month, after 25 years of service--17 of them in my  office--Pam will begin her well-earned retirement.  Pam first arrived on Capitol Hill as a college student and served in  my office with my friend, the late Representative Ben Gilman of New  York. She first started in my office as a legislative assistant, and  her policy knowledge and genuine desire to serve my constituents  quickly became apparent.  Because of her hard work, determination, and positive attitude, Pam  was promoted to legislative director, deputy chief of staff, and,  eventually, she became my chief of staff. Her leadership in my office  has been invaluable.  It is no secret, as dean of the House, I have been here for a long  time. As a Member of this institution for nearly 20 years, Pam stuck  with me through thick and thin, and I will always be grateful for her  faithful service.  She is well respected by everyone, from alumni of my staff and her  colleagues on Capitol Hill, to leaders in the State of Alaska and  advocates far and wide. You simply do not achieve this level of respect  unless you set the gold standard for what a congressional staffer  should be. Pam has gone above and beyond at every turn.  Mr. Speaker, a chief of staff doesn't just assist the Member; they  have an entire team of employees who, at any given time, are working on  countless issues. My staff would agree, Pam is admired, respected, and  will be deeply missed.  Pam's tenure has seen many of the victories I am proud of. She served  in my office while I served as chairman of the Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure and passed our landmark highway bill,  SAFETEA-LU. She also helped pass reauthorization of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery and Conservation Management Act. And her commitment to  constituents has helped secure millions of dollars for organizations  that serve Alaskans and Americans from all walks of life.  Aside from legislative victories, Pam understood the importance of  the relationships in Congress. She made sure that my office was always  in good spirits. And as many will attest, she ensured that our annual  office Christmas parties were the best on the Hill.  Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of Pam, and I am saddened to see her go.  She served me, our State, and our Nation with professionalism,  commitment, and a sincere love of country. She has always been  committed to the next generation of congressional staff and has been a  respected mentor to many of the staffers, both in my office and around  Capitol Hill. Her leadership in my office was invaluable, and she will  be missed by her colleagues as well as myself.  Mr. Speaker, it has been my great honor to call her my chief of staff  and an even greater honor to call her my friend.  Pam, I wish you the best in your retirement. You have certainly  earned it. God bless you, Pam, and thank you for your service.    "
