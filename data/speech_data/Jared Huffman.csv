Jared Huffman,1.8205643892288208,D," Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to one of  the many important provisions of today's legislation. In particular, I  rise to discuss Section 1109 of Title XI of Division FF, relating to  aquatic ecosystem protection, which comes from the FUTURE Western Water  Infrastructure and Drought Resiliency title that I authored in "", H.R. 2, ""  earlier this year.  Today's provision is an improved version of that legislation, and it  is the result of the ongoing bicameral water infrastructure  negotiations between the committees of jurisdiction. I am grateful for  the work done on both sides of the Capitol and both sides of the aisle  to bring this to fruition. This aquatic ecosystem protection provision  is designed to fund broadly-supported fish passage projects in the  western states, and the specific intent is to help projects like the  one in the Eel and Russian River basins in California, where we have a  chance to significantly improve fish passage and habitat on the Eel  River while providing long term certainty and reliability for Russian  River water users.  The Potter Valley Project Ad Hoc Committee has been refining this  effort for several years, and we now have a Two-Basin Partnership that  is taking the next steps. The intent of this new aquatic ecosystem  protection statute is to support the important work of the Two-Basin  Partnership, as well as other community-supported restoration projects  like it around the west.  I am including in the Record letters of support from the Round Valley  Indian Tribes, Humboldt County, Sonoma County Water Agency, Mendocino  County Inland Water and Power Commission, and California Trout-- collectively known as the Two-Basin Partnership--as well as from the  Nature Conservancy, Trout Unlimited, and California Trout--collectively  known as the California Salmon and Steelhead Coalition.  I thank my colleagues for working with me to bring this legislation  to fruition, and thank the staff in both the House and Senate who have  helped in this effort, especially Matthew Muirragui from the House  Natural Resources Committee and John Driscoll, Logan Ferree, and Ben  Miller on my personal staff. I look forward to working with the next  administration to support this win-win outcome for the North Coast and  North Bay. "
