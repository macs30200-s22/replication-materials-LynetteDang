Scott Perry,0.3509203791618347,R," Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my friend, the gentleman  from Florida, in support of this important resolution.  We know as a fact, confirmed by Reuters, the New York Post, and many  other news outlets, that the Chinese Communist Party has recently  forced 500,000 Tibetans into labor camps--500,000.  Through these camps the CCP wishes to sinicize the Tibetan people and  destroy their religious and cultural heritage and national identity.  If you asked the General Secretary Xi Jinping why his country  continues to undermine the national identity of the Tibetan people, he  would tell you that his party's initiative is simply part of a poverty  alleviation program wherein the CCP hopes to move surplus rural labor  to other parts of the country. It is absurd, and it is outrageous. The  fact that a foreign leader could believe that this kind of public  policy is morally acceptable is beyond me, and it is beyond the  civilized world. We have heard similar explanations before.  We know what these so-called poverty alleviation programs are really  about: Xi Jinping desperately wants to crush the spirits of those who  are living under his dictatorial regime. He wants to indoctrinate  people in those camps and ruthlessly marginalize their identities.  Mr. Speaker, you don't need camps for people who are seeking to do  better in their life; you just give them the opportunity, and they will  do it. They don't need to go to camp to do that.  He will fail in his effort. Make no mistake about it. He will fail  spectacularly in his effort to quash the hopes of millions of Tibetans  who dare to dream and fight for a free nation. One of the reasons he  will fail is because the United States is with the people of Tibet.  Our Tibetan friends have long since recognized the significance of  the genuine autonomy of Tibet, and today I am proud to join them.    "
