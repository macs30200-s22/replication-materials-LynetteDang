Bryan Steil,0.2988791763782501,R," Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the 2020 Water  Resources Development Act.  In southeast Wisconsin, the Great Lakes are vital to our environment,  our economy, our health, and our way of life. Let me put it this way:  If the Great Lakes region were a country, it would have the third  largest economy in the world.  We must pass WRDA to protect the Great Lakes, invest in America's  water infrastructure, and generate economic growth.  Earlier this year, I urged the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee to include the Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study and the  Brandon Road project in WRDA. Both programs are included in today's  bill. These programs detect vulnerabilities along the Great Lakes  shoreline and prevent invasive species in the Great Lakes.  Mr. Speaker, I ask Congress to pass WRDA and support the Great Lakes  for generations to come.    "
