James Langevin,2.4950084686279297,D," Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut  (Mr. Larson) for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of "", S. 578, "", the ALS  Disability Insurance Access Act, which ensures that individuals who are  diagnosed with ALS are not forced to wait to receive the Social  Security Disability benefits that they have earned and they so  desperately need.  The onset of a disability can be a difficult, challenging, and often  disorienting time. However, by eliminating the 5-month waiting period  for ALS patients to receive disability benefits, we can help families  facing this difficult diagnosis focus on their health and well-being  instead of worrying about how to keep a roof over their head or put  food on the table.  Madam Speaker, I applaud my good friend and colleague, Senator  Sheldon Whitehouse, for championing this bipartisan effort in the  Senate. He has been a strong voice for the ALS community as co-chair of  the Senate ALS Caucus, and I have been proud to work with him on this  legislation.  Madam Speaker, I also recognize our colleague here, Representative  Seth Moulton, for his leadership as well.  Madam Speaker, I also want to recognize one of my constituents,  Christa Thompson, who has been a dedicated crusader for the ALS  community. Christa knows the struggle all too well, as she has watched  her husband, Olin, battle this devastating disease.  Christa, a proud mother of three boys, made it her mission to engage  with me and my delegation colleagues early on, and it is in large part  due to her efforts and the efforts of ALS advocates everywhere,  including my good friend, J.R. Pagliarini, who has been such a champion  of ALS back in Rhode Island, that we will be able to provide some  important relief to families.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  measure.  Let's make a difference for these families and those diagnosed with  ALS.    "
