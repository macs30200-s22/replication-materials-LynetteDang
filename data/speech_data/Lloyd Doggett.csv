Lloyd Doggett,1.233229398727417,D," Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, I join today in support of the ALS  Disability Insurance Access Act to ensure that individuals diagnosed  with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) receive the financial support  they need and for which they have already qualified. I congratulate  Congressman Moulton and Senator Whitehouse on their successful  leadership for this important effort of which I have been a cosponsor.  For individuals who are determined to have a sufficiently severe  disability to quality for Social Security Disability Insurance, the  security that Social Security is intended to provide can come with a  cost--two years without health insurance. This waiting period--which  should really be called a suffering period--must be eliminated. Two  unjustified delays prolong the suffering. The first, a five-month delay  to receive any disability payment even though the recipient has already  qualified. The second, is a two-year delay to access Medicare coverage  for which they already qualified.  This means that the millions of individuals with disabilities in this  waiting period may not be able to access necessary medical treatments  and medications. This only makes existing health complications worse  and increases overall health care spending. Many die waiting their turn  for health coverage. In 2018 alone, about 16,000 workers with  disabilities died during the 5-month waiting period and about 56,000  workers with disabilities died waiting for Medicare coverage.  These waiting periods only serve to harm the health of individuals  with disabilities and delay the support they need. In addition to this  bill for individuals with ALS, other colleagues have offered  legislation to end the waiting periods for individuals with metastatic  breast cancer, Huntington's Disease, and other life-threatening  illnesses. I support all of these efforts. We must provide a healthy  foundation for all individuals with disabilities, who already arc  experiencing unique health challenges.  I hope that this ALS bill represents a step forward in the eventual  approval of the bipartisan Stop the Wait bill, "", H.R. 4386, "", that I  introduced to eliminate the onerous waiting periods for Social Security  Disability Insurance and Medicare. This bill now has 50 House  cosponsors. and Senator Bob Casey has introduced companion legislation.  Having recognized the suffering of these waiting periods for Americans  with ALS, I urge Congress to consider the suffering of all those  subject to waiting periods and pass long-overdue reforms to Stop the  Wait. We must ensure individuals with disabilities have access to  health care when they need it. Social Security cannot truly provide  health care security, until all individuals with disabilities have  guaranteed access to prompt Medicare coverage. Let's Stop the Wait for  all of them.    "
