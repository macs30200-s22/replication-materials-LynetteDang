John Ratcliffe,0.4992993175983429,R," Mr. RATCLIFFE. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Neguse and Ranking  Member McClintock for their leadership on this committee.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of "", H.R. 2819, "", the Gold Star  Families National Monument Extension Act.  I was very pleased to have the opportunity to introduce this  bipartisan bill, along with my Democratic colleague, the gentleman from  New Jersey, Congressman Kim, on behalf of our Nation's Gold Star  Families.  The term ``Gold Star Family'' dates back to World War I, when flags  were displayed bearing a blue star to represent a family member serving  abroad and gold stars used to designate family members who had been  lost in combat.  As the Representative of a congressional district in northeast Texas  with more than 50,000 veterans, and thousands and thousands of active  duty servicemembers, this bill very much hits home.  My home State of Texas is home to 1 of every 10 U.S. servicemembers,  and nearly 25,000 Texas families have joined the National Gold Star  Family Registry since World War II.  The families of all the individuals who serve our country know the  great sacrifices that are made when a loved one answers the call of  duty because, unfortunately, all of our heroes don't always make it  back home; and it is their families who will forever bear the burden of  that ultimate sacrifice when they don't return home.  As a grateful Nation, it must be our constant priority to honor our  fallen heroes and their families. After all, we owe our freedom to  their great sacrifice.  I am confident that the Gold Star Families National Monument will  help ensure that we honor our fallen heroes and their families on a  national scale by extending the authorization for the establishment of  a national monument located right in here in Washington, D.C.  The Gold Star Family Monument will be constructed at no cost to  taxpayers, as all of the funds that are being raised are being raised  by the Gold Star Mothers National Monument Foundation.  I am grateful for the opportunity that the Gold Star Family Monument  will provide to all of our citizens to pause and honor the ultimate  sacrifices made by our fallen servicemen and servicewomen on our behalf  as they visit our Nation's capital.  Despite the often polarized political climate in Washington, this is  an issue that people across the political spectrum should all be able  to stand behind.  Again, I thank my Democratic colleague, Congressman Kim, for his  leadership on this important effort, and I urge the rest of our  colleagues for their strong support on the floor today.    "
