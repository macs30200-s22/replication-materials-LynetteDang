Tony Cardenas,1.3369059562683103,D," Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the Appropriations  Committee and the subcommittee chairs for including two amendments that  I submitted to "", H.R. 7617, ', division [[', Page , H4134, ] B and division F, in the en bloc being considered today.  For years, we have been funding a juvenile justice system that is  robbing children of their futures and wasting taxpayer dollars. Today,  experts, academics, advocates, and police departments agree we must  change that for the better.  I am proud to have introduced two amendments to ', H.R. 7617, ', division  B, that will increase funding for programs that focus on girls in the  juvenile justice system and invest in collaborative mental health and  antirecidivism initiatives.  I have also cosponsored an amendment led by my colleague, Congressman  Rush, that will increase funding for community-based violence  prevention initiatives and also introduced an amendment to ', H.R. 7617, "",  division F, that will increase funds for the National Child Traumatic  Stress Initiative. This investment will help increase evidence-based  support for youth with mental health needs that have been exacerbated  by this pandemic.  I ask for my colleagues to support this bill and my amendments that  are offered today. We need to have a better system for our children.    "
