The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to "", House Resolution 833, ', the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I rise with enthusiasm and support for  ', H.R. 2474, "", the PRO Act.  I would indicate that in America we would ask the question, When will  we have a 40-hour week or the weekend? All brought about by union  organizing and union leadership.  We need the PRO Act to ensure that Americans across the land have the  ability legally to organize and to be able to operate under the Labor  Management Reporting and Disclosure Act.  Let me also say that it is imperative that we begin to recognize that  the American people like unions. Over 64 percent of Americans and  millennials appreciate the idea of having representation for better  quality of life and work.  So I rise to add to this very important legislation an amendment that  extends whistleblower protections to employees of both employers and  unions under the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act. This is  a fair and balanced amendment. We remember Supreme Court decisions like  the Janus Act, and many others, who undermine the ability for unions to  be able to organize or to engage. This protects the people who are  trying to organize.  But the whistleblower protections allow employees of employers and  employees of unions to be protected if they see something wrong and  they want to make sure that it is right.  Let me give you an example:  Today, I met Kimberly Lawson, who is part of the Fight for $15. She  also came to share the problems she has had with sexual harassment on  the job. It happens to be in one of the fast-food operations. She said,  on the record, that if we could pass the PRO Act, she wouldn't be alone  trying to raise our hourly wage or face sexual harassment without a  union to help her.  This is important legislation. The whistleblower protection is  important because Ms. Lawson would have the ability to be able to  report what is happening to her without losing her job as a single  mother with a young child.  Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    "
