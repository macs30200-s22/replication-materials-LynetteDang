Chellie Pingree,0.7839431762695312,D," Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, on January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court  ruled, 7-2, that women have the right to make their own healthcare  decisions and to legally access abortion care. Forty-seven years later,  our country has seen significant social and economic progress since Roe  v. Wade.  Seventy-three percent of Americans support keeping Roe v. Wade the  law of the land. They agree we can't go back. And yet, nearly 50 years  after Roe became settled law, abortion is still under attack by extreme  politicians who believe the government should dictate whether and when  to have a child.  From 2011 to 2018, States across our country enacted 424 separate  restrictions on abortion. In 2016, Donald Trump campaigned on a promise  of appointing Justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade, and he has  appointed more than one-quarter of all active judges to date.  His administration has pushed a domestic gag rule to prohibit doctors  from telling women about their legal right to access abortion and  slashed access to family planning funding in the process.  As we honor the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, we must expand abortion  access for women across the country and stand up to the senseless  attacks on women's health.    "
