Terri Sewell,1.9721357822418213,D," Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Blumenauer for  yielding me the time.  I rise today in support of "", H.R. 991, ', my legislation to reauthorize  the Caribbean Basin Trade Promotion Act.  Madam Speaker, I thank my Republican colleague, Brad Wenstrup, for  his leadership on this bill. I also want to thank Chairman Neal and  Ranking Member Brady for all of their help.  Madam Speaker, I especially want to acknowledge my chairman of the  Subcommittee on Trade, Mr. Blumenauer, for hosting a very meaningful  hearing on the Caribbean Basin Trade Promotion Agreement and its  importance of being reauthorized by September 30 of this year.  For two decades, the Caribbean Basin Trade Promotion Agreement has  been a critical tool to expand our diplomatic and economic relationship  with countries throughout the Caribbean Basin region. This agreement  has allowed for duty- and quota-free treatment of products made with  U.S. goods.  The liberalization of our trade relationship with these countries has  strengthened Western Hemisphere supply chains, while providing economic  development and job creation in the region.  In 2018, United States exports to CBI countries totalled $13.4  billion, while imports totaled $6 billion, creating a $7.4 billion  goods trade surplus for the United States.  One of those Caribbean Basin countries, Haiti, has had tremendous  economic benefits by the Caribbean Basin Trade Promotion Act. The  economic benefits of the CBTPA are essential, with over 90 percent of  their nearly $1 billion in exports entering the United States with the  CBTPA or HOPE duty-free treatment. Moreover, the Association of Haitian  Industries has estimated that the CBTPA, along with the HOPE and HELP  programs, has created over 50,000 jobs in Haiti, alone.  The reauthorization of this program ahead of the September 30  deadline will allow us to continue to strengthen the foundation for  long-term economic stability, while contributing to our diplomatic and  security interests.  Continued economic development in the region is a goal that we should  all share, and the passage of this legislation will reaffirm the  commitment of the United States to this objective. [[', Page , H4656, ]  The importance of our diplomatic and economic ties with the Caribbean  Basin countries is highlighted by the strong support for this  legislation that we receive from the Congressional Black Caucus.  In a letter of support for ', H.R. 991, "" to congressional leadership, the  CBC aptly pointed out: Millions of Americans have Caribbean ancestry  and make up important segments of the United States population. Haiti  is the first Black republic, influencing the rise of abolitionist and  anticolonial movements all across the world, especially in the United  States.  The history and the future for millions of Americans is directly tied  to the economic prosperity of Caribbean Basin countries, and our  relationship must reflect this reality.  Within this context, we also must continue to push our trading  partners for compliance with key eligibility criteria under the  agreement, including upholding the rights of workers and combating  corruption. A lapse in this agreement would jeopardize the economic and  social well-being of workers in the region.  Today's step forward to reauthorize this very important trade  promotion program will allow for continued cooperation and enforcement  on these critical issues. I look forward to remaining engaged with all  of the stakeholders to support these goals, including expanding human  rights and economic prosperity for all.  Madam Speaker, I want to thank the Ambassador of Haiti, Ambassador  Denis, who testified before the subcommittee, for his eloquence on the  importance of the Caribbean Basin Trade Promotion Agreement for Haiti,  in particular.  Madam Speaker, I also want to thank all of the representatives from  the eight Caribbean Basin countries that have come to my office and  talked to us ad nauseam about how important it is that we extend the  Caribbean Basin reauthorization.  As well, Madam Speaker, I would like to also thank Charlie Rangel,  who was the member of the House Ways and Means Committee who really  championed this initially, two decades ago. When I took Charlie's  position on the Ways and Means Committee, he sat me down and told me  how important it was that we not only reauthorize, but we strengthen  the Caribbean Basin Trade Promotion Agreement.  So this is an important step in reauthorizing this very important  trade agreement before its September 30 deadline.  Madam Speaker, I again want to say how proud I am that this agreement  has huge bipartisan support. The reauthorization of this program would  not be possible if it had not been for the bipartisan support that my  colleague from Ohio, Congressman Wenstrup, has so ably provided, a  partnership in this agreement.  While debate over U.S. trade policy is often rigorous, the  reauthorization of the Caribbean Basin Trade Promotion Agreement should  be something that we can all support.  Madam Speaker, I am proud that this important issue is before us for  a vote, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this very  important legislation.  Again, Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Blumenauer for  allowing me to speak on this very important measure.  {time} 1145    "
