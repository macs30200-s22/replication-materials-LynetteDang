James Inhofe,1.2119359970092771,R," Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, after visiting our southern border  countless times, most recently in August when I toured the Mexican side  of the border with their deployed National Guard units, I know that we  face a dire situation that is only improving because of the aggressive  action taken by President Trump. As he and I both know, more needs to  be done. Securing our border is vital to national security.  In our discussions with the Mexican Government following my recent  trip, they expressed strong support for doing work on their southern  border to stem the tide of illegal immigrants from other nations in  Central America. Accordingly, I am proud to introduce the Mirador- Calakmul Basin Maya Security & Conservation Partnership Act, which will  provide critical resources to the region to supplement the efforts made  by the Government of Mexico to secure its own southern border. These  resources will be critical because increased insecurity and lack of  economic opportunity in this region are drivers of emigration from  Guatemala and Mexico to the United States as local communities face  pressure to participate in deforestation, logging, narcotics  trafficking and other illicit activities. It is in the best interest  for the national security of the United States to support political  stability, reduced migration, reduction of poverty, and enhanced  economic development around the basin in Guatemala and Mexico.  The Mirador Basin features beautiful Mayan ruins with networks of  pyramids, palaces, and ancient cities that many consider to be the  eighth wonder of the world, and I would agree. I used to fly my plane  over the Mirador Basin, and I have seen the magnificent structures with  my own eyes. My legislation will support efforts made by the Department  of the Interior, the Department of State, the Mexican Government the  Guatemalan Government and various universities and research  institutions to secure this region and ensure future generations are  afforded the same opportunity to see these magnificent Mayan ruins.  One of the most important things we can do to secure this region is  support the local communities surrounding the Mirador Basin by  providing economic opportunity and ensuring that this community  receives direct economic benefit. If the members of the local community  are able to find work in the region, it will greatly reduce the  incentive to attempt the arduous journey to illegally immigrate to the  United States.  Mr. President, it is critical that we secure our southern border.  Border security is national security. It is just that simple. There are  many proposals targeting this issue, and I support many of them-- including building the wall. This additional legislation is a targeted  approach, and I thank Senators Udall and Risch for joining me in this  initiative.    "
