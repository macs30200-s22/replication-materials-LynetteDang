Will Hurd,0.4310474395751953,R," Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of ', H. Res. 1250, "", to create a national artificial intelligence strategy.  For decades, American leadership in emerging technologies has created  prosperity and security across the world, but this leadership is no  longer guaranteed. As the Chinese Communist Party continues to use any  means possible to become the next world power and world's leader in AI,  it is all the more vital that the U.S. have our own strategic plan.  For almost a year, Representative Robin Kelly and I worked with  policy experts, stakeholders, and the Bipartisan Policy Center to  develop guidelines that will prepare America's workforce, counter our  adversaries, promote research and development, and shape the ethics of  AI based on America's values.  This resolution outlines specific steps and actions the Federal  Government should take to ensure our global leadership in this emerging  technology. If we don't take advantage of AI, Mandarin and the yuan-- not English and the dollar--could dominate the global economy.  Vladimir Putin once said that whoever masters AI will master the  world. That is why America--not Russia and not China--must be at the  helm.  I came to Congress to make our Nation safer, and I am proud one of my  last pieces of legislation before this body will do just that.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, Robin Kelly, for  partnering with me on this critical effort and our staffs for making  this happen. I hope all of our colleagues will join us in supporting  this resolution.    "
