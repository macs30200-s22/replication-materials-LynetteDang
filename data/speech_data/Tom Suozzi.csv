Tom Suozzi,1.0548388957977295,D," Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Chairman for his leadership on  the CASH Act and also, as he mentioned, on the Ban Surprise Billing  Act. It is really amazing the relief we are going to be giving to  consumers this year on a bipartisan basis with his leadership. We are  going to be making people's lives a lot better. So I thank him so much  for the work he has done on both the CASH Act and on the work to  address surprise billing.  Madam Speaker, the effects of this pandemic have been cruelly uneven.  Some remain unscathed, working remotely and still healthy, while  millions of others are awash in misery, unable to return to work or pay  their bills, even funeral bills for lost loved ones.  While the stock market has hit a new record today, there are still  bodies stored in refrigerator trucks. While online retail and grocery  stores are booming, airline, Broadway, and mom-and-pop store employees  have been laid off, and life savings invested in small businesses have  been wiped out.  The President's cynical ploy to threaten the COVID relief package to  obscure his dark-of-night pardons has now resulted in a fighter's  chance that we can pass this $2,000 stimulus check legislation if we  can only get Mitch McConnell to finally show some empathy.  Let's pass this bill, and then let's immediately work to send the  billions necessary to save our State and local governments before they  fire police officers, teachers, and frontline workers, which will only  result in more unemployment checks from us and financial ruin for those  families and the communities they serve.  Let's rebuild our infrastructure and put Americans back to work.  Let's build back better. We can do this if we remember why we are here  and we, both Democrats and Republicans, recognize that outside of this  Beltway fantasyland, millions of Americans are desperately pleading for  our help.
