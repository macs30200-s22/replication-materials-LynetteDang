Jeff Duncan,0.1451259851455688,R," Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the former chairman for  yielding me the time today.  I rise in opposition to ', H.R. 4447, "", the Democrat's so-called energy  package. This bill promotes a radical Green New Deal policy that would  cost Americans more than $135 billion. Meanwhile, the bill provides no  regulatory or permanent reforms.  If Democrats were serious about reducing emissions, they would focus  on getting clean technologies, like nuclear energy, to market quicker.  I offered an amendment last night, but it was rejected by the Rules  Committee which would facilitate efficient environmental reviews for  nuclear reactor licensing. Its goal was to accelerate the deployment of  nuclear reactors which generate zero emissions during electricity  generation, if that is your goal, zero emissions. Unfortunately,  Democrats would rather weaponize our permitting laws for political  motives.  If we eliminate natural gas, or nuclear, in power generation and  transition to 100 percent renewables, which "", H.R. 4447, "" seeks to do, the  cost to national security would be detrimental. The United States would  shift from being an energy-dominant country to being energy dependent  at a cost to energy consumers because lower income Americans in this  deal would pay more as a percentage of their disposable income than  others.  It would be costly to the environment and our own security self- interest. I don't understand why my amendments aren't made part of this  package other than the politics.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on "", H.R. 4447, "".    "
