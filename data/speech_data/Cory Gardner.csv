Cory Gardner,1.839766025543213,R," Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I would also like to take a moment to  say thanks to the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police. They work  long hours to ensure that Members of the staff and Members themselves  are able to carry out their duties safely. On top of that important  duty, they also protect the public who comes to visit to express their  opinion, to express their right to assemble and free speech in the  Capitol and beyond, not only to tour this beautiful Capitol Building,  but to make sure their thoughts are heard on our Nation's policy  issues.  I know every one of my colleagues will join us in expressing our  gratitude to law enforcement and first responders not only in Colorado,  but across this Nation this holiday season. They will give up time with  their own families to make sure that others are safe.  To all those who defend that thin blue line, thank you, and God  bless. You have my enduring support. May you all have a happy and  blessed holiday season.  I yield the floor.    "
