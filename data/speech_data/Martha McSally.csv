Martha McSally,1.4753979444503784,R," Ms. McSALLY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the importance  of a vote we took earlier on the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2020.  This bill delivers on the needs of the warfighter today and invests  in capabilities we must have for the future.  I also fought for and secured huge wins for the Grand Canyon State.  As home to 10 military installations, Arizona plays a key role in many  missions critical to our Nation's defense. Our bipartisan legislation  highlights the incredible contributions that Arizona bases, citizens,  and industry make to support our military each and every day.  Since I have been in Congress, I led the fight to stop the A-10 from  being mothballed, and this bill continues to secure resources needed to  modernize [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7087"">Page S7087</a>, ] the A-10, based at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.  We also succeeded in funding a new hangar and barracks at Marine  Corps Air Station Yuma and additional F-35s at Luke Air Force Base and  Yuma for training and deploying the next generation of F-35 pilots.  I also secured funding to upgrade the Barry Goldwater training ranges  and many other Arizona initiatives.  The annual defense bill is about protecting the people who protect  us. This year's bill reiterates to the men and women of our military  that we have their backs. It provides the highest pay raise in a decade  and protects military families from greedy contractors who provide  their tenants dangerous and unlivable base housing. These contractors,  who act more like slumlords than landlords, will now be required to  implement a tenant bill of rights.  We also give military families more power in filing disputes and fund  additional housing office personnel to ensure families have advocates  on base.  I am particularly pleased to see 17 of my 18 reforms to combat sexual  assault in the military are also included in this bill. Earlier this  year, I disclosed that I, too, am a survivor of military sexual  assault. After I did, I charged the top leaders at the Pentagon to  immediately identify ways to improve the investigation process and  support to victims.  My provisions increased the number of personnel investigating sexual  assault cases and ensure a victim has access to a special victims'  counsel within 72 hours of reporting an assault. These and my other  improvements share the goal of getting justice for victims sooner.  The greatest disappointment in an otherwise bipartisan bill is the  lack of backfill funding for military construction projects.  After unprecedented obstruction by Democrats on border security  funding, some resources were diverted to border security projects under  authorities legally granted to the President by Congress.  I hear from my constituents all the time in our pro-military and  southern border State: We can and must secure our border and fund our  military. Life is full of difficult choices. This shouldn't be one of  them for any Member on either side of the aisle.  The Senate voted in a landslide, bipartisan way, 86 to 8, to fund  effective military construction projects in this bill--in the Senate  version of this bill. Then, during conference negotiations, Democrats  refused to fully fund these projects due to political games surrounding  border security.  Think about that for a minute. They didn't like the President  diverting the resources to secure our border, so they decided to take  it out on our military by refusing to backfill funding.  Our military deserves better. The American people deserve better.  Nevertheless, one of Arizona's fiscal year 2019 projects at Fort  Huachuca was stalled for unforeseen environmental issues at the  construction site, so it wasn't ready to spend the fiscal year 2019  funds that we approved for it. This funding would have been diverted to  some other purpose in any other year. It could have been funded in  fiscal year 2020, but the Democrats refused to support that. The  earliest the project will be ready to start is next summer.  The Secretary of the Army has assured me that this project will be in  the budget for fiscal year 2021, which starts 9\\1/2\\ months from now,  following the completion of this environmental cleanup. I will continue  to fight for the funding for Fort Huachuca and resolve to work hand-in- hand with the Army until this project is complete.  Finally, I have to note that this is the first NDAA that this body  has passed in decades without Senator John McCain. I think I speak for  Members of the Armed Services Committee and this entire Senate when I  say that we have felt his absence deeply this past year. While he may  not have been physically with us, it still has the fingerprints of his  leadership, grit, and ultimate dedication to servicemembers and  military families.  His memory has propelled us to secure lasting, meaningful reforms for  the men and women who serve, whether in uniform, as a family member, or  in a supporting civilian role.  This is the 59th consecutive annual defense bill that has been  passed. It remains a shining example, for the most part, of what we can  accomplish when we work together to protect Americans and support our  troops.  It was my privilege to bring home these massive wins, working with my  colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, for our troops and for the  great State of Arizona.  I yield the floor.    "
