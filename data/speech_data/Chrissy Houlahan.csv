Chrissy Houlahan,0.2186829894781112,D," Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Speaker, Pennsylvania, like the rest of the  country, is in the midst of both a public health and an economic  crisis. This clearly isn't news to anyone. We have been here for months  now.  My community--the people whom I represent--are looking to us--the  people whom they just cast ballots for--to comprehensively address this  crisis. No matter which side of the aisle that you are on, Madam  Speaker, we have a collective responsibility to address the COVID  pandemic from both the public health and economic perspective.  I have been in my community talking to small business owners.  Hardworking Pennsylvanians need Federal support to weather this crisis.  An economic recovery cannot ignore the needs of our small businesses.  That is not recovery at all.  We need to pass my Paycheck Protection Small Business Forgiveness Act  to expedite forgiveness for Paycheck Protection Program loans for less  than $150,000, which accounts for more than 90 percent of PPP borrowers  across the country. [["", Page , H5863, ]  This pandemic has taken lives and livelihoods from so many  Pennsylvanians. We have the opportunity here to contain this virus and  reverse this economic fallout. I urge the passage of the Paycheck  Protection Small Business Forgiveness Act.    "
