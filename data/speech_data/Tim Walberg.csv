Tim Walberg,0.7665769457817078,R," Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for  taking advantage of National Bible Week to give us a chance to talk  about foundational principles.  It was back in 1973--and this is a great book, the Bible. In 1973, a  beloved mentor of mine brought me into his office, and he said: Tim, I  think there is a verse in Scripture that would be good for your life  verse of challenge.  He read to me from Acts 20:24 where it says:  But I do not consider my life of any account as dear unto   myself, that I might finish the course and the ministry set   before me to testify solemnly of the Gospel of the grace of   God.  I took that as a life challenge verse, and it has directed my entire  life since 1973. It has been an impactful verse from Scripture, God's  Word, to direct my steps, imperfect as they may be, to be about  something more than just myself and declare a message that talks of  eternal things and not just for the here and now.  It all began, though, back in my home with my twin brother. My mom  and dad, I thank God they were believers in this book and believers in  God and taught their two young sons to memorize Scripture to impart in  their lives.  It was a verse that was referred to earlier that was the first verse  that my twin brother and I were asked to memorize. It didn't mean  anything really to me until it became personal by putting my own name  in the words of that verse of John 3:16. For God so loved Tim that He  gave His only begotten Son, that if Tim believed in Him, Tim would not  perish, but he would have eternal life.  That made all the difference in the world. It changed my life. It  changed my perspective. It didn't make me perfect.  Mom also asked me to memorize Second Timothy 3:16, where it says:  All Scripture is inspired by God, and it is profitable for   doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for training in   righteousness.  I think mom wanted those words to be not so important for doctrine,  but to correct me, to train me, and to reprove me as I moved forward in  my life.  Even as King David said in Psalm 119: ``Your Word,'' the Bible,  ``Your Word have I treasured in my heart that I might not sin against  You.'' And if I do, First John 1:9 says:  If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive   us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  How our country needs that today. As has been pointed out, we were  founded on Biblical things, principles of Scripture that were seen to  be important for a new nation.  First Peter 1:21 says this--and I end with this Scripture:  But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture   is a matter of one's own interpretation.  We hear that in our world today. We hear that in our country: Oh,  whatever. To thy own self be true. You decide. You choose. You make  Scripture important for you in whatever way.  But it goes on to say:  For no prophecy of Scripture was ever made by an act of   human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.  My colleague, the gentleman from Colorado, thank you for giving us an  opportunity to remind ourselves that this book is from God. It is for  our benefit. It will impact this Nation for good, not evil. It will  give us the way to move forward, to bind up the division that has taken  place, to bind up the uncertainty that is there and put us back on a  path that God can bless.    "
