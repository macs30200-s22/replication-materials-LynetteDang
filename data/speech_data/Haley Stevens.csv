Haley Stevens,0.6671755909919739,D," Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend and the ray  of light that was Vicki Wagner Mansfield, a resident of Troy, Michigan,  who passed away last month after a 2-year battle with brain cancer.  Vicki, simply put, was a pillar of our community, known and beloved  by many. She was raised in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, and she moved to  Troy with her husband, Bruce, in 1985 to raise their family.  Her memory is carried forward by her beloved Bruce; her two amazing  daughters, Abbey and Rachel; and her delightful grandson, Hank.  Vicki was known as a loving wife, mother, grandmother, daughter,  sister, friend, and aunt. She is celebrated in our community for her  artistic creativity, that forthrightness, her fierce loyalty, and the  contributions that she made as an active volunteer in our community.  Vicki was a mother's mother. She was active in PTA, school events,  and political activities, always with the goal of: How do I make this  world a better place?  So many former students through the Birmingham school system have  stood up to say how much Vicki meant to them, how involved she was as a  parent with the Girl Scouts or in a play that she did. It was always  because she cared about the outcomes of their lives.  Vicki took the time in some of the remaining days that she had to  message me to say--not with a complaint or with a question--how much  she cared about the work that we do in the Congress, to pass along to  those who are in elected office a note of gratitude and thanks to say  keep going, keep giving it all you can.  That is certainly something that Vicki did every day of her life.  Her passing is also a stark reminder of our work ahead to improve the  research and treatment of cancer in this country. Glioblastoma is a  common and aggressive brain cancer with an unfortunately high mortality  rate. A strong Federal investment is essential to improve our  understanding and care of this tragic disease and for the providers  like those at the Henry Ford Medical Center and what they rely on for  good research.  I carry Vicki's light like a torch in the fight for increased funding  for cancer research. As we inch toward this deadline to fund our  government, I continue to urge and work with my colleagues to join me  in supporting robust brain cancer research funding at the NIH and DOD  to continue this lifesaving work. We cannot let those suffering from  brain cancer and their families fail. [["", Page , H7234, ]      "
