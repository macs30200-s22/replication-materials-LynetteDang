Katherine Clark,0.1590421795845031,D," Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, House Democrats took the  necessary action to defeat this virus and restore the economy in May,  but Mitch McConnell said let's hit the pause button. So Americans have  waited 7 long months for the GOP to take action to end their suffering.  As over 300,000 Americans lost their lives, they said more testing  was not necessary.  As veterans and children waited in lines at food banks, they proposed  a tax credit for business lunches.  As 8 million more Americans fell into poverty, they proposed cutting  unemployment benefits.  As one out of four women have lost their jobs and have left the  workforce, they fought to limit paid leave and access to childcare.  As 40 million Americans teeter on the verge of homelessness, they  fought to shield corporations from negligence and deny workers basic  safety protections.  This bill is too little too late, but it is a lifesaving bridge to a  better time and a new President who will focus on restoring Americans'  jobs and their health.    "
