Mark DeSaulnier,0.3957360684871673,D," Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I wish to express my support of the  Water Resources Development Act. This strong, bipartisan bill will help  assure that our nation's ports, harbors, and waterways are developed  and maintained to enhance economic and environmental vitality.  I am particularly pleased with the commitment to beneficial reuse of  dredged material from Corps water resources projects. Dredged material  is a valuable resource that can help restore impacted shorelines and  ecosystems and that can create resilient coastlines and estuaries.  Environmental groups in California have emphasized the importance of  beneficial reuse, specifically because the dredged material can play a  vital role in restoring and preserving shallow water habitats such as  tidal marshes and mudflats. The beneficial use pilot program, first  authorized in WRDA 2016, was so successful that "", H.R. 7575, ' increases the [[', Page , H3962, ] number of eligible projects. Notably, our own San Francisco Bay estuary  faces a number of issues associated with resiliency and sustainability,  and the reuse of dredged material can be enormously helpful in  addressing these critical issues around the Bay. In its report for WRDA  2020, the Committee highlighted Richmond Outer Harbor, Pinole Shoal,  and the San Francisco Bay as priorities for consideration in the next  round of pilot projects.  This year's bill also highlights the role and value of alternative  dredging methods and equipment to beneficial reuse of dredged material.  Specifically, I am encouraged that the Committee clarifies that the use  of alternative dredging methods and equipment must be part of the  overall beneficial use program. This is important as, too often, we  find that the old ways utilized by the Corps for maintaining navigation  channels will not meet modem day demands to protect our natural  resources and build a resilient future through reliable strategic  management plans that allow annual dredging.  This bill will go a long way toward improving our environment,  providing much-needed direction to the Army Corps, and supporting  California's 11th District.    "
