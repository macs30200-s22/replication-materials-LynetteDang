Don Bacon,0.8577378392219543,R," Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Steve Nelson,  a man who has been at the forefront of Nebraska's booming agriculture  industry and who retired on December 8 of this year as the president of  the Nebraska Farm Bureau, a position he has faithfully served since  2011.  A farmer his whole life, Steve has produced irrigated corn, hybrid  seed corn, and soybeans at his farm near Axtell in south central  Nebraska.  In his work with the Farm Bureau, both before and during his tenure  as president, Steve has helped to secure farm bills and worked to  reform and lower taxes to help protect farm and ranch families.  He has also fought to bolster animal agriculture against those who  want to end it and sought initiatives to grow Nebraska's livestock  industry.  While Texas and Nebraska may have had a rivalry on the football  field, they also have held a rivalry in livestock. During Steve's time  as president, Nebraska was ranked first for several years in commercial  red meat production.  Steve has also advocated for Nebraska's agriculture industry to other  countries, serving as a delegation member to Denmark, Japan, South  Korea, Belgium, and many others.  I am sure his wife, Elma, a retired nurse, is looking forward to  spending more time with her husband and is proud of the work he has  done, as are his kids: Scott and his wife, Amy, who farm with Steve;  and their daughter, Stacy, and her husband, Bobby, who live in Ashland.  Sadly, their daughter, Sarah, passed away unexpectedly in 2006. Of  course, his four grandchildren, I am sure, will spend more time with  grandpa on the farm.  I thank Steve for advocating and bolstering Nebraska's agriculture  industry. I thank him for his friendship and his counsel.  Madam Speaker, I wish Steve the best on his retirement from the  bureau.    "
