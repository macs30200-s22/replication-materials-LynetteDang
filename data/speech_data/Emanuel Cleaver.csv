Emanuel Cleaver,1.721877098083496,D," Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise to commemorate and thank Blake  Hurst for his service to the Missouri Farm Bureau and to Missouri's  agriculture community.  Blake is a well-respected gentleman throughout the State of Missouri,  not just in my home district, the Fifth. He is well known in the ag  community, serving as president of the Missouri Farm Bureau since 2010  and vice president and district board member before that.  I can attest to Blake's kindness and open-mindedness because he has  worked with this urban representative from Kansas City. For 10 years,  Blake has reached out to develop a relationship and partnership as we  work together to do things for our district.  He understands the symbiosis that exists between rural areas and  urban ones. He knows the importance of making sure that all families  can put food on their tables.  I wish Blake well on his retirement as president of the Missouri Farm  Bureau, but I know that as a farmer, he will keep busy with his family  farm in northwest Missouri and their wholesale greenhouse business.
