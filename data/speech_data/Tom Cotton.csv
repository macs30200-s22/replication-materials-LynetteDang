Tom Cotton,0.3681040108203888,R," Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, Stephen Carr has been described by friends  as a ``gentle giant'' and ``all-American boy.'' He enjoyed hunting and  fishing. He played on the offensive line at Southwest Baptist  University.  He came from a law enforcement family. He always knew he wanted to be  a police officer, so it was little surprise when Stephen joined the  Fayetteville Police Department 2\\1/2\\ years ago. He served with  professionalism and valor in those 2\\1/2\\ years as a patrol officer in  the Dickson Street entertainment district. [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7021"">Page S7021</a>, ]  Sadly, Officer Carr was in his patrol car Saturday night when he was  ambushed by a gunman looking for an officer to kill. Carr's fellow  police heard the gunshots and responded to the scene within seconds.  With little regard for their own safety, they pursued the gunman down  an alley. When confronted, they met force with force and took him down.  The whole incident took just minutes from start to finish.  Emergency services were on the scene within an instant, but despite  their best efforts, they couldn't save Officer Carr. He succumbed to  his wounds on the scene, as did his killer. Officer Carr was only 27  years old.  This tragedy reminds us of the terrible risks officers face every day  when they put on the uniform and the badge, not knowing whether they  will be alive to take it off that night. Already this year, 118  officers across America have been killed in the line of duty. Some were  the victims of random tragedies. Others, like Officer Carr, were  targeted by a criminal class that hates what the police represent: law  and order.  Since Officer Carr's killing, two more officers have fallen in the  line of duty. Detective Joseph Seals, a 15-year veteran of the Jersey  City Police Department, was shot to death while approaching two  suspected killers. Sergeant Kaila Sullivan, a 16-year veteran of the  Nassau Bay Police Department, was struck and killed by a fleeing  suspect in a vehicle. All of these fallen officers will be remembered  as heroes.  In Arkansas, especially, we will remember Officer Carr, whose watch  ended on December 7, 2019. May he rest in peace.  Honoring Storekeeper 1st Class John William Craig  Mr. President, Navy Storekeeper 1st Class John William Craig of  Monroe, AR, perished aboard the USS Oklahoma on December 7, 1941, a  date which will live in infamy. On that day, Imperial Japanese bombers  shattered the morning calm at Pearl Harbor, killing Petty Officer Craig  and more than 2,000 of his brothers in arms.  Nearly eight decades later, however, his remains were listed as  unknown and interred at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific  in Honolulu. He was reported as missing in action, but Petty Officer  Craig is missing no more. Thanks to the outstanding work of the Defense  POW/MIA Accounting Agency, his remains were accounted for in 2017, and  just last weekend, on the 78th anniversary of the attack on Pearl  Harbor, he arrived home in Arkansas to his final resting place.  Petty Officer Craig's burial is a long-overdue moment of honor for a  brave sailor. It is also a moment of hope for our many military  families whose loved ones haven't yet been found--a reminder that our  Nation will not rest until every one of our missing heroes is back in  our arms or laid to rest with honor.  We have now fulfilled this solemn pledge to Petty Officer Craig.  Nearly 80 years after his disappearance, we have affirmed once again  that the United States leaves no man behind on the battlefield.  Fentanyl Sanctions Act  Mr. President, synthetic opioids like fentanyl kill tens of thousands  of Americans each year. They are a terrible accelerant that has fueled  the worst drug crisis in our Nation's history, killing more people  every year than died in the entire Vietnam war.  These drugs aren't made here in the United States. No, they are  flooding across our borders from overseas, trafficked by cartels, and,  even unwittingly, sometimes by the U.S. Postal Service.  Synthetic opioids are often produced in superlabs by the drug cartels  that are terrorizing our border communities. But the ingredients for  those drugs--and sometimes the drugs themselves--can be traced back to  a different source: China, whose vast pharmaceutical and chemical  industries frequently have been abused to poison our fellow citizens.  The Chinese Communist Party has been waging an opium war in reverse  against the United States for far too long. As tens of thousands of  Americans have perished from overdoses, Chinese officials have turned a  blind eye to the drug criminals who have profited off of our pain. But  now, desperate for a trade deal to save its sputtering economy, Beijing  has finally promised to crack down on fentanyl and other synthetic  opioids. But we would be naive to trust any promise from Chinese  Communists, especially this one.  It is time that we take matters into our own hands. That is exactly  what we will do in the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, which  includes my bill introduced with Senator Schumer to sanction foreign  drug dealers in China, Mexico, and elsewhere. The bill also urges the  President to work with our allies to impose even tougher multilateral  sanctions against foreign drug dealers. It authorizes new funding for  law enforcement and the intelligence community for counternarcotics  activities. It establishes a commission to find new ways to stop the  flow of drugs from overseas.  This bill will soon be signed by the President and become law. This  is welcome news for law enforcement and for families who are battling  the crisis of opioid addiction, and it is bad news for the Chinese  Communist Party and foreign drug dealers around the world who are  responsible for the poisoning of so many Americans.  Protecting Europe's Energy Security Act of 2019  Mr. President, 70 years after the creation of NATO, the biggest  external threats to the alliance are our revisionist adversaries--China  and Russia. Unfortunately, however, the alliance faces some internal  threats, too, among the allies themselves, who too often fail to take  these adversaries seriously. Instead, they strike dangerous deals with  the very powers that threaten to destroy all of us.  Consider the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project between Germany and  Russia. Germany touts the pipeline's commercial benefits, but Russia  sees it differently--as a strategic tool to divide Europe and thus to  strengthen its fictional claim to dominion over parts of Eastern  Europe.  The Nord Stream 2 pipeline would effectively double the amount of  natural gas Russia could export to Europe along a route that bypasses  the alliance's eastern frontier. This would deepen the NATO members'  reliance on Russian gas while it would enhance Putin's ability to  engage in energy blackmail, just as he has done in the past. For  example, in 2009, Russia shut off the flow of natural gas to Europe  during a dispute with Ukraine, causing energy shortages across the  entire continent in the dead of winter. Putin's opportunities for such  blackmail will only increase if Nord Stream 2 is completed because he  will be able to ship his gas to Western Europe without its transiting  Eastern Europe. Therefore, he will be able to blackmail Eastern Europe  while the Germans will sit warm and toasty in their living rooms-- indifferent to the plight of their NATO allies to the east.  This pipeline is almost complete, so the timeline for action is  short. Thankfully, the National Defense Authorization Act includes our  bill to impose mandatory sanctions on companies that are constructing,  insuring, or financing Vladimir Putin's pipeline to Europe. These  sanctions are a demonstration of our commitment to the strength and  security of the whole NATO alliance.  I urge the German Government and all companies involved in this  dangerous endeavor to pull back before it is too late and to consider  the serious consequences that Nord Stream 2 could have for their  security as well as for the security of the NATO alliance as a whole.  Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps Homeschool  Mr. President, homeschooling parents sacrifice a lot when they make  the legitimate and indeed very admirable choice to personally educate  their children. In effect, these parents are making the choice to go  back to school themselves so that their kids may receive well-rounded  and faithful educations.  Their sacrifices pay off in spades. Homeschooled students  consistently prove to be outstanding citizens because they are taught  the importance of patriotism, faith, hard work, and sacrifice--virtues  exemplified by their parents and their teachers.  Homeschooled students, therefore, ought to be prime candidates for  our Armed Forces for this very reason, but until now, in some places,  it hasn't been clear as to whether homeschooled [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7022"">Page S7022</a>, ] students have been eligible to join their local Junior Reserve  Officers' Training Corps Programs. Now that is going to change.  The 2020 National Defense Authorization Act includes my bill--also  sponsored by Senator Jones--which clarifies that homeschooled students  may indeed enroll in their local JROTC Programs. Our bill will ensure  that the Nation's 2.5 million homeschooled students will have the  opportunity to sharpen and deploy their skills in service of our  country. This will move us closer to being a society that fully accepts  and indeed celebrates homeschooling families for the noble paths they  have chosen.  PCS Act  Mr. President, the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act includes  many valuable reforms. One such reform is the PCS Act, which is  legislation I introduced with Senator Shaheen, that helps military  spouses keep their occupational licenses even when they are on the move  across State lines.  One in three military spouses works in a field that requires one to  have an occupational license, and too many spouses are forced to  recertify every time they move between States. That can be very often.  Most military families move every 2 to 3 years, and when each move  requires an expensive, time-consuming recertification process, many  military spouses might as well kiss their jobs goodbye. These  occupational licenses are a costly burden for military families, who  have already sacrificed so much for our country.  Our PCS Act will alleviate this burden by empowering the Department  of Defense and the States to negotiate interstate compacts for  occupational licenses in fields in which military spouses often work.  These compacts, which are made possible by our bill, will ensure that  military spouses will be able to pursue their careers uninterrupted  even while they are moving their families from State to State and base  to base. Most importantly, the PCS Act will allow military families to  focus on their mission, which is to protect and serve our country with  honor.  I yield the floor.    "
