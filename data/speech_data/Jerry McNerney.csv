Jerry McNerney,1.7915009260177612,D," Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Michigan. I can  tell you a couple minutes is enough time because I am a brief speaker,  but it says a lot that I am willing to come down here and risk COVID to  speak in favor of a Republican. So there you have it.  I have known Greg Walden for many years now in the committee. On  trips [["", Page , H6899, ] and on new legislation, he has been a gentleman, and he has been a  person I could work with.  We have some disagreements, don't we, Greg?  But that says a lot that we can disagree and still be friends.  I went to Oregon to visit and to see the eclipse, and Greg invited me  to go to his place with his friends and watch it with them. I really  appreciated that. So it shows you that people can get along in this  institution, work together, and have respect for each other.  {time} 1745    "
