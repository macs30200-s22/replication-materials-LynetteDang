Jack Reed,0.346327006816864,D," Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the HOSPICE bill,  which is a part of the overall BENES Act we are debating today. And I  am proud to support the HOSPICE bill that I introduced and authored  with my good friend, Jimmy Panetta, from California.  Madam Speaker, I can tell you, when loved ones, like my mother,  became sick, it is common to be left feeling helpless and for families  not having the resources to deal with that terrible situation. But I  thank God every day we were able to support my mother with a wonderful  team, not only of our family but of our hospice care providers. They  gave her, and they gave us, the needed companionship and resources to  have some sense of normalcy at the end of her illness. That experience  reaffirmed the critical importance of the quality-of-life care that  hospice care represents.  Madam Speaker, that is why I am a hospice volunteer in my personal  time here in Washington, D.C. I am a strong advocate for hospice care  across America.  However, while most hospice employees and volunteers and  compassionate caregivers are good, hardworking individuals, there are  some who neglect and potentially even abuse patients in that situation.  We must hold those bad actors accountable. We must demand additional  oversight of hospice providers. We must educate providers with  additional training to ensure patients receive the best and most proper  level of care they deserve.  We are confident this legislation would do just that by giving HHS  the tools it needs to penalize those that provide poor quality care.  Our legislation would also improve provider transparency by requiring  States to maintain a toll-free hotline where abuse and neglect can be  reported.  Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand in support of this legislation.  More importantly, I am proud to be a hospice volunteer myself, and I am  proud to stand with the hospice community that is giving so much great  quality care to those that need it most in their most precious time  that they have left.  Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill and the  underlying legislation upon which it rides.    "
