Peter Welch,1.0665136575698853,D," Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, on March 1, Vermont had the lowest  unemployment rate in its history. Today, it has the highest  unemployment rate in its history. About one-third of Vermonters who  would like a job can't find a job.  The Federal Government is the only entity that has the fiscal  flexibility and the fiscal capacity to meet that need. We have to act.  This legislation would provide Vermont with over $2 billion for State  and local budgets. Absent that, the pain is going to be pressed,  pressed, pressed down into our firefighters, our teachers, and our  kids.  It has reforms to the Paycheck Protection Program so our restaurants  and our small businesses have a chance to make use of that, something  both sides want to happen.  It has $75 billion for testing, which is the path to getting on top  of this virus.  It provides funds to try to stabilize our institutions of higher  education that we must have on the other side of this virus.  There are differences, and we don't have the luxury of time for the  full debate all of us would prefer, but we must act, and we must act  now. If we make a mistake in how we proceed--and mistakes will be  made--it should be on the side of erring to do too much, not too  little.    "
