Robert Casey,1.32082998752594,D," Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of 1LT  Michael Cleary from Dallas, PA. It has been 14 years since his death.  Michael is one of some 288 Pennsylvanians killed in action in the wars  in Iraq and Afghanistan.  First Lieutenant Cleary served as platoon leader of the Explosive  Ordnance Disposal Team in E Company, 1st of the 15th Regiment, 3rd  Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division of the U.S. Army.  On December 20, 2005, First Lieutenant Cleary was killed in action  while working in a bomb factory near Samarra, Iraq. His platoon was  ambushed outside the facility. He was just 24 years old.  Even prior to joining the Army, Michael Cleary was an active member  of his community. He graduated from Dallas Senior High School in  Dallas, PA, and was a 4-year varsity athlete in both soccer and tennis.  He was captain of both teams in his senior year. He received the Dr.  Pepper Soccer MVP Scholarship and a history scholarship at high school  graduation and was offered academic scholarships at Ursinus College,  Gettysburg, as well as Dickinson and Lafayette--all very strong  academic institutions of higher education in Pennsylvania.  He followed his father's footsteps and chose Hamilton College in New  York. While at Hamilton, First Lieutenant Cleary participated in  varsity soccer and lettered in varsity tennis. After the September 11,  2001, attacks on our Nation, he wanted to enlist in the Special Forces  but chose to follow the advice of his mother and stayed in school until  completing his studies.  In May 2003, he graduated from Hamilton with honors. During his  senior year, he applied to and was accepted into the Marine flight  officer program. He was notified that his class would be deferred until  January. Not wanting to wait any longer to serve his country, Michael  Cleary decided to enlist in the U.S. Army. Three weeks after college  graduation, he went to basic training and earned his airborne wings and  sapper tab and graduated from the Special Air Service Antiterrorist  Course.  The news of First Lieutenant Cleary's death came just before he was  scheduled to return home during the Christmas season. He was also  planning to get married 2 months after he returned home to his high  school sweetheart. First Lieutenant Cleary earned the following awards  and decorations: the Army Achievement Medal, National Defense Service  Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army  Service Ribbon, and Overseas Service Ribbon. His family also received  First Lieutenant Cleary's U.S. Army Bronze Star and Purple Heart.  Following his death, First Lieutenant Cleary's father, Jack,  described his last conversation with his son the day before he died.  Jack Cleary is someone I have gotten to know since his son's passing,  but here is what Jack said at that time. I am quoting him directly.  ``He''--meaning Michael--``was very upset that they were sending home  some of his men without their awards . . . for things like promotions,  and he was fighting for his men. That is the kind of officer he was.  Michael was a fine man. He cared about all people, great and small.''  Jack Cleary knows of what he speaks because he, himself, served in  Vietnam and, as I mentioned earlier, was also a graduate of the same  college. 1LT Michael Cleary's legacy lives on with his family. His  mother, Marianne, is a member of Gold Star Mothers where she works to  support veterans, military families, and her community every day.  Jon Bellona, Michael's college roommate, is a director and founder of  the 1LT Michael Joseph Cleary: Run for the Fallen, a run across America  to raise awareness about the lives of those who fought to activate  their memories and to keep their spirits alive. Run for the Fallen  supports organizations that help wounded veterans, as well as the  families of those killed, and helps aid the healing process for those  Americans whose lives have been affected by war.  All Americans are grateful for the friends and family of fallen  servicemembers who not only continue the legacy of service to the  Nation, but who take their tragedy and turn it into a force for good.  1LT Michael Cleary is one of so many bright, talented, and dedicated  young men and women who have died in service to our country. While I  speak specifically of Michael today, his story is the story of  thousands of men and women across our country, hundreds of them in  Pennsylvania who have given their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan and  also have given their lives in service of American values, values like  democracy and liberty and rule of law.  As we remember Michael Cleary, we should also remember the words of  Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln reminded us that people like Michael  Cleary gave, as Lincoln said, ``The last full measure of devotion to  our country.'' It is at times like this when we should remember not  only those words, but also other words from the Gettysburg Address,  where he said, ``It is us, the living, rather, to be dedicated here to  the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly  advanced.''  So that was our charge from President Lincoln all those generations  ago. We must strive every day, whether we are citizens or public  officials, whatever our station in life, we must strive every day to  complete that unfinished work that Lincoln talked about, so that, as we  discuss major security issues like U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan or  combating the resurgence of ISIS in the Middle East or exercising  oversight over U.S. military engagements overseas and look increasingly  to try to resolve complicated global crises, we must not forget that  those who have given the ultimate sacrifice and service to our country,  particularly in the most recent wars, are those we should remember.  Just consider these numbers of Americans who have lost their lives in  the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, with an additional seven killed in  African Command operations since 2001. That number is 6,989 Americans  just in those conflicts, just in that timeframe. These 6,989 Americans  includes some 300 servicemembers from Pennsylvania, the fifth highest  total of any State. No. 2, over 49,000 in that time period have been  wounded, including more than roughly 2,000 from Pennsylvania. So 6,989  killed since 2001 nationwide and over 49,000 wounded in that time  period.  Third, although the administration refuses to be transparent in its  deployment tracking, press reports indicate that approximately 19,000  Americans are currently serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, with an  additional 65,000 serving the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia.  This year, Pennsylvania lost MSG Benjamin Hines of York County, PA,  assigned to the 25th Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division, Marine  Forces Reserve. He was killed by a roadside bomb on April 8 in Parwan  Province, Afghanistan, along with two other marines: SSG Christopher  Slutman and SGT Robert Hendricks. Staff Sergeant Slutman also had  family ties to my home State of Pennsylvania.  While we are so grateful that Pennsylvania did not suffer more losses  this year, any loss of life is not only devastating, but should also  cause us to reconsider the nature of our military commitments overseas.  These fighting men and women are born into families, [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7017"">Page S7017</a>, ] not into divisions and brigades. They are sons and daughters, husbands  and wives, fathers and mothers. Their love for their families are  matched only by their devotion to our country, but many more bear the  scars of war.  Some families have a loved one who served in Iraq or Afghanistan and  were returned home, but who were one of the more than 49,000 who were  wounded. We must not overlook the unusually high percentage of Iraq and  Afghanistan veterans who have died since returning home, whether from a  drug overdose or suicide or the effects of combat. Thousands of  American families continue to pay a terrible price for the courage and  dedication of their family members who gave life and limb for this  country.  We have much to think about, not only on this day, but, of course, in  this season--this season of hope, this season of gratitude, this season  of our time together with our families back home, but we should  especially remember those families who have loved and lost, those who  have lost someone in combat, those who have lost someone who served so  nobly, served on behalf of the rest of us.  At this time, Mr. President, I know you have personal experience with  this, having served yourself, and I know that you understand this. It  is an important time to remember those who have given so much for our  country, with the spirit of gratitude for their service, hope that we  don't have more losses in the coming year, and with confidence that  they have set a great example for us.  I yield the floor.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    "
