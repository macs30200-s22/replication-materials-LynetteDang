Steve Cohen,1.29899799823761,D," Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Julius  Rosenwald and Rosenwald Schools Study Act, a bill I introduced with  Representative Danny Davis and Senator Dick Durbin from Illinois. It is  also cosponsored by 43 of our colleagues in the House of  Representatives and nine Senators.  This bill would begin the process to establish a Julius Rosenwald &  Rosenwald Schools National Historical Park to focus on the incredible  impact of Julius Rosenwald, a successful entrepreneur and renowned  philanthropist who made lasting contributions to the advancement of  African American education during the twentieth century.  Mr. Rosenwald was the President of Sears, Roebuck & Company who used  his fortune to enhance the lives of others--establishing museums,  community centers, and housing as well as helping Jews in Europe and  new immigrants to the U.S. Moved by Booker T. Washington's  autobiography Up from Slavery, Mr. Rosenwald committed his time and  finances to improving the lives of African Americans. Notably, he  established the Julius Rosenwald Fund that partnered with local  communities to create over 5,300 schools in the south to address the  lack of education for African Americans. During the 1920s, 1930s, and  1940s, one-third of all African American children in the south were  educated in Rosenwald schools. A 2011 study by two Federal Reserve  economists concluded that the schools played a significant role in  narrowing the education gap between black and white students in the  south.  In addition, Mr. Rosenwald provided matching funds to communities for  construction of YMCA's for African Americans during the Jim Crow era.  The Rosenwald Fund supported the early NAACP cases that eventually led  to the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, provided fellowship to  African Americans in the arts and sciences, and supported a number of  Historically Black Colleges and Universities, including Fisk, Dillard,  and Howard. Mr. Rosenwald improved the lives of those in Chicago as  well, creating the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago and the  Museum of Science and Industry among many other local initiatives. When  I was seven years old, our first family vacation was to my mother's  hometown of Chicago. During that trip, we went to the Museum of Science  and Industry, which my mother and others referred to as ``the  Rosenwald.'' That memory led me to dig into the life of Julius  Rosenwald as an adult. My dear and late friend, Julian Bond, told me  about the Rosenwald schools and that furthered my appreciation of this  man's farsightedness, empathy and wisdom.  The esteemed contralto singer Marian Anderson, discriminated against  in the Jim Crow South, won a prestigious Julius Rosenwald Fellowship  that allowed her to tour Europe, entertaining heads of state, making  headlines in American newspapers and creating ``Marian Mania'' around  the world. Returning to the United States, she was invited by President  Franklin Roosevelt and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt to play the White  House in 1936 and, famously, sang ``My Country 'Tis of Thee'' from the  steps of the Lincoln Memorial on Easter Sunday 1939 after being denied  the stage of the Daughters of the American Revolution Constitution Hall  by segregationists.  The documentary, ``Rosenwald,'' by Aviva Kempner was a fitting  tribute to Julius Rosenwald. I was privileged to be present for a  showing at the White House East Wing when Barack Obama was president  and Valerie Jarrett was his senior advisor. Ms. Jarrett's maternal  grandfather, Robert Rochon Taylor, was involved in carrying on the  legacy of Julius Rosenwald by helping to plan, build and manage what  became known as Rosenwald Courts, a multiunit housing complex in  Bonzeville.  Julius Rosenwald was a visionary philanthropist whose altruism--and  philosophy of giving embodied the Jewish concept of tzedakah--social  justice and charity. It's past time to ensure his legacy receives its  due place in history. I urge my colleagues to support the swift passage  of the Julius Rosenwald and Rosenwald Schools Study Act.    "
