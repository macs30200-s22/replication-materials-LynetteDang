Thomas Massie,0.0994013547897338,R," Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, my mail, if I send it to my neighbor, goes  to Charleston, West Virginia, before it comes back to Kentucky. Is this  part of some vast conspiracy? No. It's part of a decade's long  realignment process where the post office is trying to match the needs  of the consumers to the post office infrastructure.  These voter suppression conspiracies, who knows what the Democrats  will blame next. Last month they were blaming the Census, this month  they are blaming the post office, probably next month they will blame  Amtrak.  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch), the chair of the  Subcommittee on National Security for the Committee on Oversight and  Reform.    "
