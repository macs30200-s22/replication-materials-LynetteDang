Van Taylor,0.3584381341934204,R," Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the legislation  that I introduced with my colleague and fellow Texan from the 16th  District, Veronica Escobar, ', H.R. 8354, ', the Servicemembers and Veterans  Initiative Act.  As a veteran who proudly served our country in the U.S. Marine Corps,  I know how important it is to ensure that those who have served in our  armed services are protected from fraud and appropriately represented  by the Department of Justice.  We owe a great deal to the courageous men and women who risked their  lives to keep us free. Just as they have fought to keep us safe, we  must also work here in Congress to protect those servicemembers from  those who wish to do them harm, and that is exactly what this bill aims  to do.  ', H.R. 8354, "" would formally establish the Servicemembers and Veterans  Initiative within the Civil Rights Division at the Department of  Justice and codify its role and responsibilities. This office would be  tasked with protecting the legal interests of the military and veterans  community and advise the Attorney General on how to protect  servicemembers and veterans from the fraud and predatory schemes that  are out there.  Last year, the Federal Trade Commission noticed that U.S.  servicemembers are increasingly becoming targets of fraud. In fact, our  servicemembers and our veterans lose more on a dollar basis than the  civilians who are targeted by similar schemes. This is unacceptable,  and we owe it to those who serve to prevent this targeted crime.  The Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative at the Department of  Justice would also play an important role in coordinating the  prosecution of those who commit fraud specifically targeting our  Nation's servicemembers and their families.  This bill is an important step toward protecting our Nation's heroes  from fraud, and I am proud to stand with my colleague, Congresswoman  Escobar, in support of this bipartisan legislation, and I urge all of  my colleagues to vote in support of this important bill.  {time} 1715    "
