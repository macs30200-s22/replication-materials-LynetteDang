Donald Payne,1.101915717124939,D," Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss my bill, the Removing Barriers  to Colorectal Cancer Screening Act. It has been a long time coming.  I thank my friend and New Jersey colleague, Congressman Frank  Pallone, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. As chairman  of the House committee, his leadership was critical to getting my bill  to the floor today.  I have been working on this bill since my arrival to the United  States House of Representatives. Unfortunately, colorectal cancer is  the reason that I am a member of this body.  In addition, I thank my coleads on the bill, as you heard earlier,  Congressman Rodney Davis and my colleague from Virginia, Donald  McEachin, who has been instrumental in moving this bill forward.  Congressman McEachin has done an incredible amount of work to promote  the bill and increase awareness of colorectal cancer. I also thank my  other colead, Congressman David McKinley from West Virginia, for his  efforts, as well.  These great representatives understand the importance of this bill to  the health and security of millions of Americans and know that  colorectal cancer is bipartisan in nature of its negative impact on  people in this country.  Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in  America. It only trails lung cancer, and it affects both men and women.  It is the second leading cause of death in the United States in  cancers.  Like many cancers, it is treatable and patients can recover if it is  caught early enough. But that depends on whether Americans get  screened. And one of the reasons that we are here today, my bill would  seek to remove one of the barriers to screenings. It would allow  Medicare to cover screenings and surgical procedures to remove  cancerous polyps during the screenings.  Today, Medicare covers only screenings for eligible patients. If  doctors find and remove a cancerous polyp during the screening,  patients could wake up to a surprise bill that could cost thousands of  dollars.  After my father succumbed to this dreadful disease, I had my first  colonoscopy, and at that time they found 13 polyps. So can you imagine  the bill that I could have potentially awoken to, tens of thousands of  dollars in bills that I did not even know that I had?  Too many men refuse to get screened because of the fear of this  surprise bill and a lot of the reason why men don't find this procedure  very palatable. Then they wait to get screened until there is a  problem, and potentially that is a decision that could be fatal.  I encourage my House colleagues to vote for this bill so we can save  thousands of American lives annually.  It has been almost 9 years since I lost my father, Congressman Donald  Payne, Sr., to colorectal cancer, and I do not want to see other  families go through the same horror and pain.  I ask that we pass this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes''  and save the lives of the American people.    "
