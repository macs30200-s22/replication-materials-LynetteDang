Cory Booker,0.9934759736061096,D," Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I want to express my disapproval of the  confirmation of Eugene Scalia as Secretary of Labor. America's workers  are the backbone of our economy, and the Secretary of Labor should be  entrusted to strengthen worker protections, support unions, and play a  crucial role in ensuring a just economy. Instead, Eugene Scalia has  repeatedly demonstrated that he prioritizes the well-being of corporate  interests over those of workers. Throughout his career as a corporate  lawyer, he fought against unions, worker safety regulations, and  consumer protections rules. For those reasons, I do not believe Eugene  Scalia is fit to serve as Secretary of Labor.  My grandfather was one of the first Black members of United Auto  Workers at Ford Motor Company, and through him, I learned the  importance of worker rights that collective bargaining provides.  Through collective action, unions are able to provide workers with  livable wages, safe working conditions, and access to benefits like  healthcare coverage and retirement savings. Not only has Eugene Scalia  represented companies in arbitrations against collective bargaining  agreements, but he identifies it as one of his most significant career  moments. The Secretary of Labor should be doing everything in their  power to make it easier--not harder--for working people to join unions.  Eugene Scalia also represented the Chamber of Commerce in working to  overturn the fiduciary rule, a commonsense step towards protecting the  retirement security of countless working families. Employers trying to  design a quality plan for their workers, workers starting to save, and  retirees trying to avoid spending down their nest egg too quickly  deserve access to quality advice, without fear that financial bias is [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S6088"">Page S6088</a>, ] clouding their broker's judgment. Unfortunately, that access to  quality, unbiased advice was ultimately overturned, in part thanks to  the efforts of Eugene Scalia.  More Federal oversight and stricter safeguards are necessary to  prevent the exploitation and discrimination of working people; yet  Eugene Scalia has dedicated his career to fighting against the existing  safeguards. He argued that more than 30 women alleging sexual  harassment and retaliation should have their claims thrown out,  defended a company that refused to hire a woman because she had  dreadlocks, and fought against corporate whistleblowers. He has also  worked to undermine the rights and protections provided by the  Americans with Disabilities Act, stating that workers with disabilities  should not be provided workplace accommodations.  When I go back to my home in Newark, I see many working families  struggling to make ends meet, sometimes while working two to three  jobs. They often face underemployment, wage stagnation, wage theft, and  a variety of other tactics meant to keep wages down and suppress worker  rights. They deserve a Secretary of Labor that will fight for them. The  Trump administration and the previous Secretary of Labor have been  relentless in their efforts to roll back workers' rights, attack  unions, and undermine civil liberties. Unfortunately, I do not have any  reason to believe that Secretary Scalia will be any different. This is  why I must express my deep concern and opposition to his nomination and  confirmation as Secretary of Labor.    "
