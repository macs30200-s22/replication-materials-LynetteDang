Mike Bost,0.7493078708648682,R," Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I stand in full support of "", H.R. 7105, "", and I am  proud to be the sponsor of several provisions included in today's  veterans' omnibus bill.  The first is a provision that would modernize the Service-Disabled  Veterans Insurance program by increasing the maximum coverage from  $10,000 to $40,000; ensuring that veterans cannot be denied coverage  for any preexisting condition; removing the requirement that veterans  apply for coverage within 2 years of receiving an award of service  connection; and requiring premiums to cover the long-term cost of the  program, like the VA has with other life insurance programs.  Once the modernization program goes into effect, the outdated program  would be sunset for new applicants.  Another provision of mine will authorize a pilot program to extend  license portability to certain nonphysician providers who perform  disability exams under contract with the VA. As a result, contract  vendors will be able to schedule a veteran's exam sooner. [["", Page , H7207, ] This is critical, as the VBA focuses its efforts on reducing the  backlogs of disability exams that has been caused by the pandemic.  Additionally, this bill will address a problem that occurred when a  veteran has a change in their dependency status, but the VA does not  take immediate action to reduce the veteran's benefits payments. As a  result, the veteran may incur an overpayment that the veteran must pay  back. My provision would allow a veteran to remove their dependent from  their award through eBenefits within 60 days of the veteran's input and  without VA approval.  This package also includes another one of my bills, "", H.R. 7445, "", which  would expand eligibility for VA home loans programs to certain members  of the National Guard and Reserve.  Mr. Speaker, it is only right and logical that members of the  National Guard and Reserve who perform Federal Active Duty be given the  same benefits as their full-time Active Duty counterparts.  Before I close, I would like to thank Ranking Member Roe for his  leadership on the committee these past 4 years, both as ranking member  and as chairman. He has done a great job of representing the veterans  of this Nation and making sure that his focus and the committee's focus  is kept on what is best for them.  I want to thank him for how he treats and works with each member of  the staff, as well as each Member, to guide us through. Remember, under  his guidance, we have enacted several pieces of legislative  accomplishments, including appeals reform, the MISSION Act, and the  Forever GI Bill.  Now, as the full committee ranking member, I hope to follow in his  footsteps, and I hope I can do him proud and continue our work to  improve benefits and services for our veterans and their families.
