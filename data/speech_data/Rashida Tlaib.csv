Rashida Tlaib,1.410513401031494,D," Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in calling  for immediate action on COVID relief.  It is an outrage that Senate Republicans and the impeached  President's administration are more focused on undermining our election  integrity and faith in our democracy rather than delivering relief to  millions of Americans who are struggling right now.  With over 20 million unemployed and more than 8 million having fallen  into poverty, recurring monthly payments are desperately needed to  protect the American people from further harm and loss.  Due to the lack of Federal commitment and funding, the maximum amount  a worker in my district gets on unemployment is $362 a week, Mr.  Speaker; $962 under the first stimulus payment. So now you are asking  workers, our families, our neighbors, to live with $362 a week. Not  anyone here could survive on that.  Due to the uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus, new stay-at-home  orders and business restrictions are necessary to protect our public  health.  But we must couple this with orders with strong, recurring Federal  support, putting money directly into the pockets of Americans, so they  can actually afford to stay home, and support our local governments and  businesses on the brink of collapse without more stimulus.  This pandemic has also made clear the need of guaranteeing access to  clean water to our neighbors.  Washing one's hands is crucial to preventing illness and spread. We  need to treat water as a human right, and ban water shutoffs  nationwide, and ensure that every American has what they need to  protect themselves during this pandemic.  So, Mr. Speaker, sending stimulus checks, supporting State and local  governments, small businesses, and preventing water shutoffs are some  of the first steps we must take to not only control the spread of this  coronavirus but to recover from its devastation.  I urge my Republican colleagues to please join me in taking urgent  action.    "
