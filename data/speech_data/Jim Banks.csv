Jim Banks,0.5771211385726929,R," Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding time  to me today and for his many years of service. America and the world  are safer today because of Mac Thornberry's service in the United  States House of Representatives.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Smith, the chairman of the committee, as  well, for ensuring that this year's NDAA is bipartisan once again.  Mr. Speaker, I want to rise most of all in support of the aptly named  Mac Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act.  While the bill doesn't include everything I want it to and there are  certainly items that I wish would be removed, overall, it ensures that  our Nation is protected, and it supports our men and women in uniform.  So many in the Trump administration have warned us for years that  China is our Nation's long-term strategic competitor, and countering  China is a key focus of the fiscal year 2021 NDAA.  Having just been a part of the Future of Defense Task Force and the  China Task Force, I am more motivated than ever before to stop the  Chinese Communist Party's egregious affronts on the U.S. Government,  its citizens, and our military. I appreciate the inclusion of many  important recommendations from both of those task force reports in this  year's NDAA.  This NDAA establishes the Pacific Deterrence Initiative to strengthen  U.S. posture and capability in the Indo-Pacific region, and it works  better with [["", Page , H6927, ] allies to deter against Chinese malign behavior.  {time} 1330  It also protects against Chinese industrial espionage by requiring a  Presidential assessment on how to deter it and large-scale cyber threat  of intellectual property and personal information.  The NDAA also includes a number of protections for Federal  investments in science and technology by including new mandates on  university research and limiting funding for universities with  Confucius Institutes, for example.  These are just some of the very important provisions in this year's  bill, to not just acknowledge the China threat, Mr. Speaker, but to  address it head-on. That is why I urge all of my colleagues to vote in  favor of this critical legislation.    "
