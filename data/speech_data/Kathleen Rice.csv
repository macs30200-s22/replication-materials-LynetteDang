Kathleen Rice,2.0071663856506348,D," Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, Democrats claim to be the [["", Page , H5423, ] party of the little guy. It is easy to talk, but actions speak louder  than words.  Republicans have offered plan after plan to help ordinary people who  need it and to help small businesses struggling to survive, businesses  like the 1,700 restaurants along the Myrtle Beach Grand Strand back  home that have been devastated by this pandemic. If Speaker Pelosi  would allow a vote on any of these bills, they would pass the House and  Senate easily, and folks back home would get the help they need.  But Democrats have blocked every plan to help the little guy unless  we also bail out broke blue States and restore the deduction for State  and local taxes for millionaires and billionaires. You see, 90 percent  of the benefit of the State tax deduction goes to earners in the top 10  percent. Over 50 percent of the benefit goes to millionaires and  billionaires in the top 1 percent, who don't need a bailout.  Take Michael Bloomberg, for example. He made over $3.5 billion last  year. Mr. Bloomberg works in New York City, which has a combined State  and local income tax rate of 12.5 percent. That means restoring the  State and local tax deduction would reduce Mr. Bloomberg's taxes by  $160 million. That is right, Mr. Bloomberg would get a $160 million  bailout.  For months, the Democratic leadership has held back help for the  little guy who desperately needs it as ransom unless we agree to give a  bailout to billionaires like Michael Bloomberg, who would get an extra  $160 million. Why would they do that?  Remember in the Presidential debate when Michael Bloomberg bragged  that he spent $100 million to buy 21 new Democrat seats and put Nancy  Pelosi in charge? Now we know why.    "
