Kirsten Gillibrand,0.3387629985809326,D," Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment because, as it is written, it really rewards only companies  that are very wealthy and successful with additional tax credits to do  something they are already doing. By that measure, it will leave most  American workers without basic access to leave.  The other potential idea is about shifting hours and suggesting that  workers have to work overtime to be able to have paid leave. Every  parent in America, every person in America, will have a time when they  have a family crisis--whether it is a dying parent, whether it is a  sick spouse, whether it is a new child--and we are still the only  industrialized country in the world that doesn't have access to  national paid leave. We should be able to come together around this  commonsense solution that Senator Schatz has offered to create at least  the first step to make sure our Federal workers aren't  disproportionately harmed because they can't compete with the private  sector.  I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.    "
