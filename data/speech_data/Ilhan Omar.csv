Ilhan Omar,0.3280244767665863,D," Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I am here not only to defend my friend and  colleague, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; I am here on behalf of women  around the world. This is not just about one woman, one incident, or  one verbal assaulter. This is about respect and fundamental equality.  Like Alexandria, I was raised by a dignified man who told me that I  deserved equality because I was an equal human being to my brothers. I  am appalled often, like Alex was, when we hear men say: I would never  do this because I have a wife, I have a daughter, I have sisters.  Madam Speaker, you don't only respect women because they could be  your mother, they could be your wife, and they could be your sister.  No. You respect women because they are equal human beings to you. That  is how my father raised me, and that is how Alexandria's father raised  her.  Nearly every woman in the world has experienced verbal abuse, not  just once, but since they were little girls. We experience it on  playgrounds; we experience it in workplaces; and we experience it in  our social media feeds. We see it coming regularly from the President  of the United States, and now we see it coming from his partisan  lackeys. From birth, little girls are sent the message that they don't  matter.  In this body, we have seen men who are afraid of Muslim women like me  and Rashida Tlaib because we say proudly that you cannot ban us from  this country because we pray differently than you. They are afraid of  women everywhere fighting systems of repression and sexual harassment  through the Me Too movement. They are afraid not just of us but of  losing their own power.  It is no accident that Alex was verbally abused for speaking up for  poverty in her district and its relation to unrest because when you  push power, power pushes back. When we speak for people from  marginalized communities, we understand, as people who come from those  marginalized communities, that is a threat to those who wield power  against marginalized communities.  So, we are here to say that we will not allow sexism, misogyny, and  patriarchy to hold us back. We will not apologize for advocating for  women everywhere. We will not apologize for claiming the power that  women deserved for centuries. And we will send a message to our  daughters and their daughters that they deserve fundamental equality.    "
