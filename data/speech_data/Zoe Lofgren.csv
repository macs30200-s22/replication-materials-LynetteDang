Zoe Lofgren,2.386359691619873,D," Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of "", H.R. 4990, '.  Voting is the bedrock of our representative democracy. The integrity  of our election infrastructure is essential to free and fair elections.  Votes are cast and counted using a variety of systems, from hand-marked  paper ballots to direct-recording electronic machines. There is a whole  host of other technology that also supports the process, including  electronic pollbooks, voter registration databases, and other  components of comprehensive systems.  I support ', H.R. 4990, ', the Election Technology Research Act of 2019,  because it invests in science to bolster the resilience of election  technology, and commend its sponsor, Representative Sherrill, for  authoring the bill. This legislation is in keeping with other bills  this House has passed in the 116th Congress to protect our democratic  institutions, including ', H.R. 1, ' (the For the People Act), ', H.R. 2722, ' (the  SAFE Act), and ', H.R. 4617, "" (the SHIELD Act).  Russia attacked our democracy in 2016. Special Counsel Robert  Mueller's investigation confirmed that Russian GRU officers ``targeted  individuals and entities involved in the administration of the  elections. Victims included U.S. state and local entities, such as  state boards of elections (SBOEs), secretaries of state, and county  governments, as well as individuals who worked for those entities. The  GRU also targeted private technology firms responsible for  manufacturing and administering election-related software and hardware,  such as voter registration software and electronic polling stations.''  In July 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA) published an election infrastructure risk assessment. It found  that ``compromises to the integrity of state-level voter registration  systems, the preparation of election data (e.g., ballot programming),  vote aggregation systems, and election websites present particular risk  to the ability of jurisdictions to conduct elections.''  Our elections remain under threat from foreign adversaries. In August  2020, the Director of the United States Counterintelligence and  Security Center said that foreign states may use the 2020 elections to  ``seek to compromise our election infrastructure for a range of  possible purposes, such as interfering with the voting process,  stealing sensitive data, or calling into question the validity of the  election results.''  "", H.R. 4990, ' is commonsense, bipartisan legislation that responds to  these ongoing threats. It authorizes new research and standards for  election infrastructure security. It directs the National Institute of  Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Science Foundation  (NSF) to carry out research that will increase the understanding of  cyber and other threats to voting systems. It will lead to the  development of technology, processes, and policies for more secure and  accessible elections. This includes the cybersecurity of different  components of voting systems, end-to-end verifiable systems, voter  privacy and data protection, election auditing, interoperability of  system technologies, and ballot tracking.  Importantly, the bill also amends the Help America Vote Act to expand  the definition of voting systems to include electronic pollbooks, voter  registration databases, systems for carrying out post-election  auditing, and related technology. This will lead to improved guidance  to election administrators for these systems by the Election Assistance  Commission and its partners, which include NIST.  I am pleased to support ', H.R. 4990, ' and urge its passage.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from New Jersey (Ms. Sherrill) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, ', H.R. 4990, ', as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
