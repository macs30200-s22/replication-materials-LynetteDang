Abby Finkenauer,1.4020259380340576,D," Ms. FINKENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say thank you to this  body and to the constituents of Iowa's [["", Page , H7102, ] First Congressional District for giving me the honor to serve these  last few years, and also my incredible staff, who both here and in Iowa  have given their all to Iowa and to this country. You have made me  proud every single day to know you.  Importantly, I also want to say thank you to my family: my husband,  Daniel, who has been my rock and been with me every step of the way; to  my siblings and nieces and nephews, who have taught me to never take  myself too seriously; and to my parents, who I know are watching right  now because, as I found out within the first 6 months of being in  Congress, they actually DVR and record C-SPAN every day so that they  can find me on the floor during votes.  You know, I think back to the day that they came to visit right  before swearing in. My very first visitors to my congressional office,  where my dad, Jerry, a UA retired union pipefitter welder, and my mom,  a retired public school secretary, held hands and walked through the  door of their 29-year-old daughter's congressional office.  I can't imagine what they thought, but I hope it was better than when  I told them and sat them down at the age of 24 and said I was running  for Iowa's State House, where my mom blurted out, ``Why in the heck are  you doing that?''  Well, it has been 7\\1/2\\ years since mom asked that question, and I  hope every day they have seen the answer.  The reason I entered public service was because of them. You see, my  parents couldn't give me a trust fund or debt-free college, but what  they gave me was worth a hell of a lot more.  They taught me about treating people with respect, and seeing work to  be done and doing it; about standing up for those who need a voice;  and, most importantly, to never think you are better than anyone else  no matter what you do or where you go.  The work I have done both in Iowa and here in Congress has been  shaped by the stories and the lives of my constituents and my family,  from my late grandfathers, one a firefighter and one a Purple Heart  World War II vet who worked in a meat packing plant, to my uncles; from  a former UPS driver to a small business owner; and my mother-in-law and  my sister-in-law, both who are heroes and nurses.  Because of them, my fight for working families, wage protections,  collective bargaining, paid leave, workplace protections, have  continued to be, in every sense of the word, personal, and that is the  way policy should be.  These laws we pass--and, unfortunately on some occasions don't pass  because of stalemates--aren't just dollars and cents on a page. They  are affecting people's lives.  I hope for this body and for the American people that we can have a  Congress and a Senate who sees that and understands the value of public  service.  Until we get there fully, I hope that young people across the country  find their ``why'' and run. We need you. And when you get here, I hope  you do the work and I hope you find an incredible staff like I did to  help you do it.  You see, this place is not about the crystal chandeliers or the fancy  titles. It is about the work. It is about the people in your district.  It is about finding common ground where you can and just getting things  done.  I have been proud to get to work with my staff the way that we did  passing my first bill within the first 2 weeks, becoming the youngest  woman in the history of this body to ever pass a bill through this  floor; to working on the Small Business Committee and beginning to  chair the Rural Development, Ag, Trade and Entrepreneurship  Subcommittee, where we got to fight for things like better access to  markets for our farmers and for our small business owners; to stepping  up for our childcare workers, who need it most right now; and the work  that we did on that Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, along  with the honorable Chairman DeFazio, getting to help pass some of the  best investments in rural infrastructure that has ever come out of  either one of these Chambers; to standing here, I think in this very  spot, having to fight back against attacks on Davis-Bacon wages, good  wage protections, in the middle of a pandemic; to helping our farmers,  our biofuel industries, trying to fight for and also getting done the  biodiesel tax credit extender; to, again, one of the things I might be  most proud of, standing here sharing a story that was hard to tell  about my own battle with endometriosis, and then fighting and working  with my staff to help double that funding for research that had been at  the bottom of the National Institutes of Health's research for years.  I also just want to say a special thank you to the staff in Iowa, who  have been there for my constituents in one of the toughest years we've  ever had, this pandemic, where they have taken calls from folks  wondering about their unemployment checks, wondering about how they are  going to be able to feed their family because they are unemployed right  now through no fault of their own, to then, on top of it, going almost  2 weeks without electricity post-derecho in my district, which was  basically like a Category 4 hurricane that came through and decimated  large parts of my district.  The way that my staff stepped up when, again, they themselves didn't  even have electricity or WiFi is extraordinary. You make me proud every  day.  And the way that my constituents came together, it made me proud to  be a Congresswoman and to be an Iowan.  You see, I, again, just want to say one last big thank you to my  staff. You are all incredible public servants that I am blessed to have  known and some of the best public servants I have ever met. And I  should know, because I met one of the best.  That late grandfather I talked about, that firefighter, he was the  one who taught me what all of this was. You see, he is the guy that I  would sit around the kitchen table with when I was 10 talking about  what was happening in the world. And he is also the guy that taught me  what public service should be. You see, when he would run into a  burning building to save people's lives, he didn't call and ask first:  What color is your skin? Where are you from? Who do you love? What  language do you speak?  He just showed up and he helped people, and he did his job.  That is what I have tried to do here every single day, both here in  Congress and my 4 years in the State House in Iowa. It is what I will  continue to do in whatever I do next.  It has been an honor and a privilege to get to serve in this body and  represent this district and this country.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
