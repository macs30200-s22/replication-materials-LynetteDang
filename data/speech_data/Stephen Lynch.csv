Stephen Lynch,1.0410737991333008,D," Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Subcommittee on National  Security, I want to rise in strong support of "", H.R. 8015, "", the Delivering  for America Act.  This urgent legislation would reverse the ill-advised changes to mail  delivery that the new Postmaster General has implemented to the injury  of every American's right to vote, and at a serious peril to our  democracy.  In my own district, in the city of Boston and city of Brockton, the  Postal Service has removed at least six high-capacity mail sorting  machines in the mail facility in South Boston, and two more from the  postal processing and distribution center in the city of Brockton,  causing a 4- to 5-day delay right now in the city of Brockton.  {time} 1400  Why would someone do that 10 days before a congressional primary in  Massachusetts in the midst of a pandemic when people are being asked to  vote by mail in order to keep themselves safe?  Mr. Speaker, I was elected on 9/11, the day of the terrorist attacks  on our country. As horrific as that day was, I feel proud that our  Nation came together, as Americans do in difficult times. We mourned  our fallen heroes. We tried to comfort their families. And we turned to  face our adversary together, Democrat and Republican.  Looking back, I believe our democracy was less in danger then than it  is today. I say that for two reasons. First, because we were united  then, and we are divided today. And we know who divides us. Secondly,  back then, the threat was external. But today, at this moment, the  greatest threat to our democracy is the current administration.  I call on my colleagues: Stand together. Stand together and defend  democracy. Defend your own constituents' right to vote. I urge my  colleagues to vote in favor of "", H.R. 8015, "".  Defend democracy. You will miss it when it is gone.
