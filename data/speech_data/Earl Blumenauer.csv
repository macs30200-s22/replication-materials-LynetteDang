Earl Blumenauer,1.4485374689102173,D," Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's kind  comments and cooperation. Working with the ranking member, working with  Dr. Harris, we made real progress here.  Mr. Speaker, the cannabis laws in this country are broken, especially  those that deal with research. It is illegal everywhere in America to  drive under the influence of alcohol, cannabis, or any other substance.  But we do not have a good test for impairment because we can't study  it. Now, Dr. Harris and I don't necessarily agree on the efficacy of  cannabis, but we agree that this is insane and that we need to change  it.  At a time when there are 4 million registered medical cannabis  patients, and many more who self-medicate, when there are 91 percent of  Americans supporting medical cannabis, it is time to change the system.  Our bill will do precisely that. We have a broad coalition of Members  and organizations who support the bill, including those who do have  concerns about cannabis.  Specifically, the bill will tackle two main issues: research  licensing and manufacturing. For manufacturers, it requires the DEA to  license outside of the NIDA monopoly so we can study the products  Americans are using. For researchers, it shortens the timelines,  reduces unnecessary security measures, and streamlines approval. [["", Page , H7080, ]  This bill will not only reduce barriers to medical research but all  cannabis research. It is a narrow bill that fixes one of many broken  cannabis laws.  I want to hasten to add that this in no way negates the need to move  forward with other areas of legislation, like we did with the MORE Act.  But this is sort of a foundational question. No matter where you are,  there is no reason the Federal Government should impede this critical  research.  One of the most moving moments I have had in the last 2 years working  on this issue was in the backyard of a constituent in southeast  Portland who brought together a half dozen families with children with  extreme seizure disorder. The only thing that stopped those babies from  being tortured was medical cannabis. They had to research it  themselves. They had to formulate it themselves.  At Oregon Health and Science University, they told me: This works. We  know it works. We could go to the street corner and buy something, but  we legally can't do it.  Listening to those heartbreaking stories of the families, of what  they had to do--they crossed their fingers. It sort of worked for them.  But no family should have to do that.  We ought to get the Federal obstacles out of the way of simple,  commonsense research. It will make a difference for families across the  country. We need to move forward, so there is no unnecessary dispute  about cannabis, and get the job done.  Support the Medical Marijuana Research Act  Dear Colleague: We write to encourage you to cosponsor our   bill, the Medical Marijuana Research Act ("", H.R. 3797, "").   Regardless of your stance on marijuana, we can all agree that   there should not be onerous federal barriers to conduct   research and access objective evidence as to the medicinal   properties of marijuana.  Although more than two-thirds of Americans are living in   states with legal marijuana programs, current federal law   greatly limits researchers' ability to research this drug.   This includes the overly burdensome registration process,   redundant protocol reviews, lack of adequate research   material and unnecessarily onerous security requirements. In   fact, a 2017 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and   Medicine report found that ``research on the health effects   of cannabis and cannabinoids has been limited in the United   States, leaving patients, health care professionals, and   policy makers without the evidence they need to make sound   decisions regarding the use of cannabis and cannabinoids.   This lack of evidence-based information on the health effects   of cannabis and cannabinoids poses a public health risk.'' We   could not agree more.  The Medical Marijuana Research Act will reduce many of the   barriers to conducting legitimate medical marijuana research.   First, the bill streamlines the burdensome and often   duplicative licensure process for researchers seeking to   conduct marijuana research, while still maintaining all   necessary safeguards against misuse and abuse. Second, it   addresses the woefully inadequate, both in quantity and   quality, supply of medical-grade marijuana available for use   in such research. Finally, it requires, within five years of   enactment, a report by the secretary of the U.S. Department   of Health and Human Services on the status and results of the   then-available body of research on marijuana.  Irrespective of where one falls on the ideological spectrum   with respect to further legalization, we can all agree that   the American people deserve to know what's going on with   marijuana. The United States leads the world in biomedical   research. It is therefore unconscionable that the federal   government stands as the chief impediment to legitimate   medical research that will ensure American physicians,   patients, purchasers, and constituents have access to the   information they need to make an informed decision about   marijuana.  Sincerely,  Earl Blumenauer,  Member of Congress.  Andy Harris, M.D.,  Member of Congress.    "
