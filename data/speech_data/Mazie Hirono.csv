Mazie Hirono,0.1657840013504028,D," Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago today, the State of Hawaii was  in shock as an active shooter took the lives of two workers at Pearl  Harbor Naval Shipyard and wounded a third worker.  Located on Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam, the shipyard is a pillar  of our community. It employs over 6,400 workers who labor every day to  keep our Pacific Fleet ``Fit to Fight.''  Hawaii is a small place where we have deep connections to one  another. Almost everyone in Hawaii either is related to or knows  someone who works on base or in the shipyard. In my State office in  Honolulu, a member of my staff has a son who is an apprentice at the  shipyard and who was there that day. These connections are part of the  reason why the shooting has impacted our State so deeply. Too many  families were waiting that day for news of their loved ones in harm's  way.  The investigation into what happened is ongoing, and there is no easy  explanation for what happened and why.  It is clear that no community in our country is immune from the  tragedy of gun violence. Today, I rise to honor the lives of those we  lost--Roldan A. Agustin and Vincent J. Kapoi, Jr.  Mr. Kapoi and Mr. Agustin were both dedicated Department of Defense-- DOD--civilian shipyard workers and members of the International  Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers Local 121.  Roldan Agustin was 49 years old and lived in Ewa Beach. He was adored  by his family, who describe him as a ``true American patriot'' who  dedicated his career to his country. After serving honorably in the  U.S. Navy, Mr. Agustin also served in the Army National Guard, retiring  as a staff sergeant, having deployed to Afghanistan and Kuwait.  At Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, he served as a DOD civilian employee,  working as a shop planner in nondestructive testing and a metals  inspector.  In paying tribute to their lost loved one, Mr. Agustin's family said  in a statement:  He was a loving son, brother, uncle, and friend to many.   Having grown up in Waipahu, Roldan enjoyed working on cars   with his friends and spending time with his family and adored   his nieces. We will forever remember Roldan to be humble and   honest, and a generous and patient man.  Vincent Kapoi was 30 years old and lived in Honolulu. He grew up in  Waianae and graduated from Kamehameha schools. His father, brother,  sister, and sister-in-law are also civilian employees at the shipyard,  where he served as a metals inspector apprentice. He was dearly loved  by his family, which includes his wife, parents, siblings, aunties,  uncles, grandmother, cousins, and friends.  His wife offered these loving words:  I have been through a lot of tragedy in my life, but   nothing compares to losing the love of your life. I will miss   you truly, and I will always love you Vincent J. Kapoi Jr.  His sister Theona said in a family statement:  He will always be that easy going, fun loving, ``let's do   this'' man that will remain in our hearts. There are so many   unanswered questions. We all have to be honest, it changes   nothing because we can't bring him back. What we must do is   honor his memory, keep him alive in our hearts.  I also want to honor Roger Nakamine, who was wounded in the attack.  Mr. Nakamine was working as a civilian apprentice at the shipyard when  he was wounded.  Upon leaving the hospital about a week after the attack, Mr. Nakamine  said:  My family and I would like to express our gratitude to the   first responders and the expert medical staff at Queen's, as   well as to all the friends and extended `ohana who have been   reaching out to offer their support physically, emotionally   and spiritually. Our deepest condolences go out to the   friends and family of Vincent Kapoi Jr. and Roldan Agustin.  Roldan and Vincent, like thousands of their fellow workers, dedicated  themselves to the shipyard's critically important mission of repairing,  maintaining, and modernizing the U.S. Pacific Fleet in defense of our  country.  In recognition of their service and in keeping with the words of  their families, I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring the  lives of those we lost: Roldan Agustin and Vincent Kapoi, Jr.  This is a photograph that depicts the memorial, which was set up the  day after this tragedy, where friends and family brought lei to honor  their fallen heroes, their loved ones.  I yield the floor.    "
