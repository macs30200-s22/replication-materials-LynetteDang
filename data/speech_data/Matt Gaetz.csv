Matt Gaetz,0.0695809498429298,R," Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I oppose the NDAA, not because I am against  our troops, but because I love them so much.  America's fighting men and women are so precious that they should not  have to die in some failed state, some faraway land that most Americans  can't even point to on a map so that defense contractors can extend our  involvement in these wars, so that lobbyists can get rich, and so that  Members of Congress can get reelected.  This good bill has been hijacked by the forever war lobby and their  bought-and-paid-for allies in the United States Congress. It puts  barriers in the way of an administration that wants to bring our troops  home and put America first. This legislation has become too swampy. It  does good things to ensure that America can vanquish any foe on the  battlefield, but we should only fight when that fight is just and  proper.  Mr. Speaker, we have spent two decades trading the same villages back  and forth in Afghanistan. And I believe that the administration that  leads our country should work to bring those troops home, and  unfortunately, this bill does exactly the opposite. From Afghanistan,  from Germany, and elsewhere, I am going to put America first and I am  voting against this bill.    "
