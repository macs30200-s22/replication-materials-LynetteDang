Edward Markey,0.7802820205688477,D," Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, this month we recognize the 100th  anniversary of the founding of the American Meteorological Society,  AMS, which spent the last century advancing the atmospheric and related  sciences. The work of AMS contributed to technologies and services that  expand our understanding of the world and the risks associated with our  water, weather, and climate.  AMS was founded in 1919 in Milton, MA, to advance, promote, and  disseminate information about these important sciences. The society now  has over 13,000 members, including researchers, educators, students,  enthusiasts, broadcasters, and other professionals in weather, water,  and climate. Its rigorously peer-reviewed scientific publications and  scientific conferences have contributed to knowledge growth across the  geosciences, especially in the prediction of environmental phenomena  that has led to lifesaving services. AMS also offers nationally  recognized certifications that serve the public's need to identify  broadcast and consulting meteorologists who have achieved a high level  of competency in communicating complex weather, water, and climate  information.  AMS has been a leader in promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion  in the science, technology, engineering, and math STEM fields. Its  activities in support of STEM education and development activities for  K-12 teachers have positively impacted millions of students nationwide.  Its leadership in education also brings AMS to the Halls of Congress,  where the society supports congressional fellows, research studies on  environmental policy, and policy briefings to ensure that policies are  developed using the best available knowledge and understanding.  AMS has also been crucial in developing the extensive scientific  evidence of manmade climate change and has helped us understand the  threat it poses to society if we do not act. AMS has been an  international leader in providing peer-reviewed information to support  evidence-based decision making related to climate change. Congress owes  a debt of gratitude to AMS for its advocacy and education on this  global threat.  With the scope and size of the challenge that climate change  presents, Congress and the American people will undoubtedly depend on  another successful century of leadership and scientific advancements  from the American Meteorological Society. We congratulate and thank AMS  for its century-long effort to understand the natural world, and we  pledge our continued support to the important sciences AMS aims to  advance.    "
