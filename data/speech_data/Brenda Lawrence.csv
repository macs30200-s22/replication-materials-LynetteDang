Brenda Lawrence,0.2454857975244522,D," Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, obviously, my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle are not aware that fraud is a Federal--voter fraud is  a crime. We have already established and funded the United States  Postal Inspection Service.  Little do they know, whenever an employee is in a postal facility,  there are internal galleys in every facility where you are observed for  24 hours a day by postal inspectors. Mr. Speaker, I am very comfortable  that we will adhere to those laws. We have clerks who have sworn duties  to protect elections.  But let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, 3 months ago this House passed the  HEROES Act, and I ask my colleagues to [[', Page , H4297, ] open their mail because we sent them a letter that will protect the  Postal Service. We sent them a letter saying that we need to send  funding to the States and local governments so they will not defund the  police departments.  If you want to know who is defunding the police department, the lack  of a movement in the Senate to send that necessary money to cities who  must balance their budget. And the only way they can balance their  budget is to cut because they don't have the funding that has been  taken away from them because of COVID.  So you have the responsibility, Mr. Speaker, the Republicans have on  their hands the defunding of our police department. I wanted, too, to  be very clear that we have heard repeatedly that the Democrats had  manufactured a crisis at the expense of this President, and that the  emergency funding is ``an unnecessary bailout plan.''  We do not need to help the current President to create a crisis. We  have seen every single day statements from the White House about what  we are doing and what we should not do with the Postal Service. I want  everyone here to know that every postal employee takes an oath that  they will adhere to the Constitution, that they will serve and protect.  The majority of the postal workers are veterans who have served in  the military, who continue their service in the Postal Service. I want  it to be very clear that this election that is being held hostage right  now by the Postal Service's internal decisions to tear it apart, where  you have over 600,000 employees reporting to work who want to uphold  their oath of office.  I want to say today, Mr. Speaker, that the Postal Service motto is  neither rain, snow, heat or gloom of night you will not deter these  carriers from their mission. And we are standing here today saying, no.  Return to sender this unnecessary MTR. That we, as Democrats, we are  putting forth this bill to ensure that we are not in that place where  we are going to try to deter the Postal Service from doing their job.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to wake up, to understand that this  is not a Democrat or Republican issue, because the ballots that are  going to be moving through the Postal Service, some of them may even go  to them, they better protect the Postal Service.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.  There was no objection.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.    "
