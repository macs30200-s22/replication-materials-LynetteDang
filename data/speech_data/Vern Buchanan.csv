Vern Buchanan,0.4995062351226806,R," Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to  express my strong support the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and  Economic Security (CARES) Act.  The coronavirus is one of the most serious public health threats we  have ever faced, particularly for our seniors and people with  underlying health conditions.  That's why I was pleased to see members of Congress on both sides of  the aisle and the Trump administration work together to craft this $2  trillion emergency relief bill addressing the coronavirus pandemic--the  largest emergency aid bill in history.  This legislation provides much-needed financial assistance for  individuals, families, small and medium-sized businesses, hospitals,  medical facilities and state and local governments. The bill also  includes significant resources for our front-line health care workers  and first responders to ensure they have the vital equipment and  medical supplies they need to protect the American public and  themselves.  Going forward, we need to dramatically ramp-up the supply of test  kits, increase the number of locations where people exhibiting symptoms  can easily get tested, and accelerate the process of getting results  back--hopefully in less than 24 hours.  We also need to accelerate the development of an affordable,  effective vaccine, continue to implement proper quarantine and self- isolation procedures, and ensure the safety of our health workers who  are testing, diagnosing, and treating confirmed cases.  And while I am confident that the legislation before us today is a  significant step in the right direction, there is still much more work  to be done to help my constituents and the American people during this  unprecedented period of health and economic challenges.  With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both side of the  aisle to support this sweeping rescue package and look forward to  President Trump signing it into law.    "
