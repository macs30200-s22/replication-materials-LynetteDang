Jimmy Gomez,0.2504095733165741,D," Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, someone is lying. On one side, you have the  White House and the Postmaster General. On the other side, you have the  hardworking men and women of the U.S. Postal Service.  The President and the Postmaster General say there is nothing to see  here. Nothing to see. They tell us that their operational changes are  meant to help the Postal Service.  The Postal Service workers, whose job it is to deliver the mail day  in and day out, are saying something different. They are telling us  that they are falling behind on processing packages because of these  operational changes. As a result, they are seeing [["", Page , H4281, ] bugs and rodents swimming around containers of rotten food and meat and  animals.  Now, my Republican colleagues say that this is a conspiracy theory.  But I say to them: You can't smell a conspiracy theory. There are dying  animals, rotten food, rotten meat, rats, flies.  You can't see that in a conspiracy theory. I want them to open their  eyes because their constituents, my constituents, are suffering because  of this deliberate attempt to sabotage the U.S. Postal Service. Their  constituents--seniors and veterans who depend on fast delivery of their  medicines, the small businesses that depend on the U.S. Postal Service  to stay afloat, and every American who wants to partake in our  democracy safely during this pandemic.  Mr. Speaker, I can tell you which side I believe: the employees of  the U.S. Postal Service. It is with them in mind that I strongly  support the passage of "", H.R. 8015, "", the Delivering for America Act.    "
