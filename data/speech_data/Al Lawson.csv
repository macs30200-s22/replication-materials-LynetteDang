Al Lawson,0.645215630531311,D," Mr. LAWSON. Madam Speaker, I rise to speak for HBCUs. I would like to  thank my colleague, Ms. Adams, for all her input and how she has worked  extremely hard to put HBCUs at the forefront. [["", Page , H9216, ]  I grew up in a rural area in the country where we were let out of  high school early so that we could work in the tobacco fields in  Gadsden County. I had no idea what college was really like until  Florida A&M gave me the opportunity to attend college there.  For 132 years Florida A&M has been educating a large number of  baccalaureate degree-holders in this country, as well as engineers,  pharmacists, and you just name it, especially in the school of business  where we had one of the greatest leaders in this country of all time to  head up that school that really contributed to corporate America.  Without HBCUs, I know that I wouldn't be here. A boy walking bare- footed in the countryside had the opportunity to represent HBCUs, not  only in the State legislature but now in Congress. They have made a  major impact on this country and on economics that many of my  colleagues have talked about today.  When you think about it, where would this country be without that  impact?  On September 30 of this year, the funding was not authorized. But  that $255 million that the House unanimously passed is now sitting in  the Senate. It is imperative that we encourage our Senators to approve  this because many of these schools would not be able to function  without that funding. I happen to represent not only Florida A&M  University but Edward Waters College where it is critically needed for  these schools to survive.  Over the past 30 or 40 years, the issue also comes up, Madam Speaker,  about where HBCUs are going. Many of today's HBCUs have taken  minorities and international students from all over the country, more  so than some of the majority institutions, and they have done well. In  the area of STEM and technology, in science, we need more and more  people in STEM around the country.  Where can they come from?  They come from HBCUs.  When you look at the number of Ph.D. candidates and the number one to  get Ph.D.s in this country, where do they come from?  They come from HBCUs.  I am really proud of the fact that HBCUs, especially Florida A&M  University, molded me into the leader that I am today. It made me  appreciate hard work. I had the opportunity to have professors that  really cared about me and a goal. So for some 30-some years I have been  a part of this leadership.  I applaud Congresswoman Adams for all of her hard work and for  bringing it to the forefront. We stand here tonight to send a message  out there that we are a part of America. We are part of the American  Dream, and we urge our colleagues to support it.    "
