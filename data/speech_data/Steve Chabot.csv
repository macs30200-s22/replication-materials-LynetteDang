Steve Chabot,1.8913886547088623,R," Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for  his leadership on this issue and so many other issues over the years.  Madam Speaker, for months now, our Nation's entrepreneurs and small  business owners have been pleading for additional help from Congress. I  have been hearing this from small businesses back in my district in the  greater Cincinnati area. I know that my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle have been hearing the same thing from their constituents.  While I am relieved that Congress is finally acting on those cries  for help, I am dismayed that it has taken this long. I introduced a  bill back in September, 3 months ago, that could have been brought to  the floor and helped those small businesses that so desperately needed  that help back then.  That bill included many of the same provisions that we are voting on  today. Instead, this House, under Democratic control, considered bills  about marijuana and online conspiracy theories, for example. It is an  embarrassment that it has taken this long because every moment of delay  put more small businesses at risk of permanent closure.  These small businesses, restaurants, shops, and manufacturers employ  nearly half of this country's workers and form the backbone of  communities all across the country. Fortunately, the provisions in  today's relief package will bring critical assistance to these workers  and their families.  The Paycheck Protection Program, which has supported over 50 million  employees, will be reopened for new and second-time applicants. Funds  will be reserved for very small businesses and community lenders. The  list of eligible expenses will be expanded so that small business  owners can purchase PPE, for example, to keep employees and their loved  ones safe.  There are many more details in the package, too many to go into here.  But the bottom line is this: These provisions will bring meaningful  help to millions of Americans.  Just in my district in Cincinnati and the surrounding area, a PPP  loan helped keep 140 employees on the payroll at the Silver Spring  House restaurant. A PPP loan enabled HomeWell Care Services, an  assisted living facility, to continue their important work for our  community's elderly population. And the folks at Neyer Plumbing used  PPP funding to carry on as an essential business.  These are real people with real families to support and bills to pay.  That is why it is so important that we pass this package without  additional delay.  Small businesses and their employees are tough; they are resilient.  Across the country, we hear stories about small businesses giving back  to their communities, even when they are struggling themselves.  It is time for Congress to meet the moment and get further help in  the hands of working Americans. As a matter of fact, it is far overdue.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this long- overdue legislation.    "
