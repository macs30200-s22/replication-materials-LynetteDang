Debra Haaland,1.2714295387268066,D," Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Speaker, as one of the first Native American women  elected to Congress and the daughter of two veterans, I am proud that  my bill with Representative Mike Gallagher, the Department of  Veterans Affairs Tribal Advisory Committee Act, will be included in  this package. [["", Page , H7211, ]  All veterans deserve the best care that our country can give, but  there are gaps in services for Native American veterans.  The advisory committee established by this bill will ensure that we  look at and remedy the specific barriers Native American veterans face  so they will have access to the same care that other veterans have.  For these reasons and many more, I am thankful for the inclusion of  my bill today and look forward to seeing its implementation by  President-elect Biden.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman from California  (Mr. Takano) has expired.  Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers, and I am prepared to close.  Mr. Speaker, it is obvious today, with the minority leader, the  Speaker, and numerous, numerous distinguished Members coming to speak,  the importance of this.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano for his work on this. I thank  all the Members who, in a bipartisan way, brought this extremely  important bill to fruition.  I certainly appreciate the honor of having this bill named after  Senator Isakson and myself, and I encourage my colleagues to support  this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
