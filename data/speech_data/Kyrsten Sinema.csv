Kyrsten Sinema,1.2197409868240356,D," Ms. SINEMA. Madam President, I rise today to address one of the  biggest concerns facing everyday families in Arizona: making healthcare  more affordable and maintaining critical healthcare protections.  Sometimes the issues discussed on the Senate floor appear far removed  from the concerns of everyday Americans, but not today. Today's debate  focuses the Senate's attention on the most important issue for many  Arizonans and offers elected officials the opportunity to reject  partisan political games in favor of commonsense solutions. [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S6225"">Page S6225</a>, ]  Not long ago, insurance companies were allowed to deny care or  overcharge Americans based on the fact that those Americans had been  sick before or had been born with a chronic condition.  Arizonans who had been previously treated for skin cancer or diabetes  were told that no insurance company would cover them or that the  insurance plans they purchased would not cover their preexisting  conditions, despite promises of comprehensive coverage. Beyond major  illnesses, Arizonans with even common conditions, such as high blood  pressure, high cholesterol, asthma, and even acne, were denied the  coverage they needed. Until recently, insurance companies had also been  allowed to charge consumers high prices for insurance plans only to  leave out coverage for essential health benefits that virtually all  Americans eventually need, such as prescription drug costs, ambulance  costs, and hospital stays--critical needs that consumers rightly expect  will be covered.  Insurance is supposed to be there when people need it. Hard-working  Americans who play by the rules and pay their monthly premiums  shouldn't have the rug pulled out from under them at the very moment  they need healthcare. That is why such discrimination against people  with preexisting health conditions is now banned and why health  insurance plans are now required to cover essential health benefits.  That is why it is so disturbing that the administration and some  Members of Congress have begun moving backward, allowing insurance  companies to again sell plans to Americans that lack the very health  protections consumers need.  Congress has a lot of work to do to make healthcare affordable and  protect access for American families and businesses, from lowering  premiums to stopping surprise medical billing, but partisan approaches  will not solve these challenges. We can and must work across the aisle  to pass bipartisan solutions, such as increasing the number of doctors  to address provider shortages, lowering costs for home health services,  expanding mental healthcare, and eliminating the health insurance tax.  I have partnered with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  sponsor legislation that achieves these goals, but allowing insurance  companies to return to their old practices will only hurt everyday  Arizona families. These health plans lack key protections. They are  often called junk plans and for good reason. Junk plans mislead  Arizonans--selling something billed as health insurance when, in fact,  it is better described as a bill of goods. When Arizonans who are sold  these plans need to actually use the coverage they paid for, the rug  gets pulled out from under them yet again.  I hear from hard-working Arizonans on a daily basis who deserve  access to critical health protections; Arizonans like Chantal, who has  a preexisting autoimmune disease that without treatment would cause her  to become blind; Arizonans like Corrine from Phoenix, whose daughter  was born with a congenital heart condition--before the law protected  people with preexisting conditions, Corrine's family was unable to find  an insurer who would cover their family--and Arizonans like John from  Casa Grande, who signed up for a plan that he was told covered  preexisting conditions only to find out after he paid his first month's  premium, that his particular preexisting condition wouldn't qualify for  coverage.  There are 2.8 million Arizonans under the age of 65 just like  Chantal, Corrine, and John who live with preexisting health conditions.  That is half of all nonelderly Arizonans whose healthcare is at risk.  These Arizonans remind us exactly what is at stake and exactly what is  wrong with partisan politics in Washington today. For too long, too  many elected officials here have focused on how they can score  political points to help them win the next election, all at the expense  of the health and security of everyday families.  Arizonans are rightly worried that the dysfunction and chaos they see  coming from Washington could threaten their family's coverage, and that  is unacceptable.  It is time to get partisan politics out of Arizonans' healthcare. I  call on both parties to quit the partisan games, come together, and  stop the sale of junk plans that fail to protect people with  preexisting conditions. We must protect access to healthcare for these  millions of Arizonans and tens of millions of Americans, and we must  make healthcare more affordable for everyday families.  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on "", S.J. Res. 52, "".  I yield the floor.    "
