Ron Wyden,0.9270560145378112,D," Mr. WYDEN. Thank you for that background, Mr. Chairman. I agree with  you that it is clear that the benefit some in the oil and gas industry  are seeking from this provision is illegitimate. However, given the  significant amount of taxpayer dollars at stake should these companies  somehow prevail in litigation, it is also important for Congress to  provide clarity in this area, to protect the public purse. The tax  package under consideration in the spending bill addresses this by  amending the alternative fuel mixture credit to more explicitly deny  the credit for butane mixed with gasoline, consistent congressional  intent. This clarification is effective for any claims filed on or  after January 8, 2018, when the IRS issued a formal revenue ruling  putting taxpayers on notice that a mixture of butane and gasoline does  not qualify for the credit. However, this does not mean we agree that  such mixtures prior to January 8, 2018, qualify for the credit, and, in  fact, we are of the opinion that they do not. Do you agree Mr.  Chairman?    "
