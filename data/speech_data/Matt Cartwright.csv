Matt Cartwright,1.7309863567352295,D," Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to exhort all of us in this  Chamber to work together.  I know there are those of us in this Chamber for whom the spending of  one Federal dollar is a physically painful event, but now is not the  time to be deficit hawks. Now is the time for us to come together.  The United States of America is more than the sum of its parts. In  times of great danger to our Nation, we come together, and the Federal  Government leads the way. We did it when we defeated fascism in Europe  and Asia. We did it when we rebuilt Europe and Asia to become great  allies and peaceful and productive partners.  We can do it again. We have a terrible enemy right now in the COVID  virus. It is wrecking our economy, and it is killing our people. We  have lost more than 300,000 people, more than our combat losses in  World War II.  Let's work together for robust COVID relief for our economy. Let's  get it done, Mr. Speaker.    "
