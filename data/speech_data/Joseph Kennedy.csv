Joseph Kennedy,1.3000255823135376,D," Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say good-bye to this body  as my time serving the Fourth Congressional District of Massachusetts  comes to a close.  This job has been an honor. We have come quite a long way since my  first days in the Capitol when I had an AP reporter following me around  for the day, and I got so lost trying to find the House floor that I  ended up in the Longworth parking garage.  Luckily, things have mostly improved from there:  Seeing my name on that office door for the first time;  Keeping company with giants that I grew up idolizing, like John  Lewis, Eliseo Medina, and Dolores Huerta;  Having the honor of responding to Donald Trump's first State of the  Union from Diman Regional Voc-Tech in mighty Fall River, Massachusetts.  There are a few people who I would not be here without.  To my wife, Lauren: Thank you for serving alongside me, for the  sacrifices that you made and the heart that you gave to this job, too.  Tell Ellie and James that dad has breakfast, bath, and school drop-off  duty for the next 15 years or so.  To the Massachusetts delegation: I loved serving with you. I loved  learning from you. There is no team I would rather have been in the  trenches with every day.  To my constituents back home: I am so grateful for the trust that you  put in me. My proudest moments were when you allowed me to bring your  voice to this Chamber, when I could carry what you felt in Taunton or  Attleboro or Fall River or Milford to this floor. Thank you for the  privilege that you afforded me. I will see you back home soon.  Finally, to the staff members who worked and thought and fought and  talked and wrote and served alongside me over the course of the last 8  years; you all are the heroes behind my story. There will never be  words for my gratitude for everything that you took on every single  day--and so many nights--to ensure that we did this job right. I will  miss not seeing all of your faces quite so often.  Mr. Speaker, I leave this body proud and hopeful because here is what  I know: that we are a complicated and messy country, that we violated  our founding promises before the ink was dry. We boldly declared, ``We  the people,'' and promptly defined ``we'' as rich, White, Protestant  men. We staked out moral high ground of life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness, and paid for it with human bondage, abuse, and suffering  that we carry to this day.  But embedded in that history is a slow and stubborn story that every  generation shares, a journey to heal those wounds, an understanding  fought and bled for over time that we are in this mess together whether  we like it or not.  Our arc isn't clean, but it is clear that each generation expands  that definition of ``we.'' We suffer setbacks. We get pushed off track  and sometimes can't feel that progress. We fight amongst ourselves. But  still, generation after generation, we expand.  And that is the counterweight to the great lie of these times, that  the American pie is finite; that for my family to survive, yours must  suffer; that the richest Nation on Earth is somehow plagued by scarcity  rather than greed.  Loosening that lie's grip on our country is the work of our  generation--for people who feel unseen, unheard, and unrepresented; for  the most in need of assistance and protection, justice and opportunity,  who have been told by their government that there is no room or money  or time or will.  And that injustice is a reality etched in stone rather than a  deliberate choice by those in power about who is worthy and who is not.  I hope that in the months and years ahead, this body can help change  that, that we will err on the side of expansion, of inclusion,  acceptance, equity, and grace, because history makes clear that the  only true error is when we do the absolute opposite.  Our future is big and bright, but it will take everything and  everyone to reach it. I hope that a new generation of Americans will  rise knowing that the people's House stands tall for them.  Mr. Speaker, it has been an honor. God bless and Godspeed.    "
