Ron Kind,1.8920905590057373,D," Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I rise in proud support of this trade  agreement. It is important that we have a strong trading relationship  with our two border neighbors, Mexico and Canada, our two biggest  export markets.  I just caution my colleagues who choose to vote ``no'' on this that a  ``no'' vote is a return to the failed policy of the old NAFTA, the  status quo, rather than this more modernized version.  I am happy that dairy farmers in America are going to have greater  access to the Canadian market.  We made progress on poultry and eggs.  We also tightened up the sanitary and phytosanitary standards so that  those decisions have to be made on sound science rather than arbitrary  decisions to block our agricultural exports.  We have, perhaps, the strongest worker protection chapter ever in the  trade agreement, enhanced environmental standards, all to level the  playing field for our workers, our farmers, our businesses so they can  fairly compete rather than trying to compete in a race to the bottom.  Perhaps most importantly, we have the strongest enforcement chapter  ever, and we look forward to working with Mexico and Canada to  implement it the right way to make sure we are all playing by the same  rules.  So this is solid, and I want to commend the chair, the ranking  member, the working group, but also the staff for the countless hours  that they put in to get us to this place, but especially Ambassador Bob  Lighthizer for his perseverance and patience throughout these months.  These were difficult negotiations. This is what bipartisanship looks  like on the House floor, where we are able to get this across the  floor.  I encourage my colleagues to support this agreement, support the  Northern Hemisphere economy. Show the rest of the world that we are  back in business.    "
