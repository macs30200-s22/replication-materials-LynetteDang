Joni Ernst,0.7227510213851929,R," Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I am honored to congratulate Waverly's Randy Druvenga on the conclusion of his tenure as Chair of the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies--NAMIC--a member organization of property and casualty insurance companies. Randy has helped lead this organization through its 125th year of existence, including the NAMIC Mutual Insurance Foundation's drive to raise $125,000 for scholarships to help talented young Americans pursue their college degrees toward careers in insurance. It is fitting that Randy led NAMIC during this milestone anniversary as the association was founded by Iowans in 1895. While the Hawkeye State is happy to share Randy with NAMIC, we are most proud of his servant leadership in his home State. Randy has served as the past president of the Mutual Insurance Association of Iowa and is currently president of First Maxfield Mutual Insurance Association, a farm mutual insurance company serving more than 7,900 policyholders in northeast Iowa. He is a constant presence in his community, supporting numerous causes including the Waverly-Shell Rock Community Schools Foundation, and as a former referee and member of the Iowa High School Athletic Association Officials Hall of Fame. I want to again congratulate Randy Druvenga for his leadership. Iowans are famous for their commitment to their communities, and Randy embodies that spirit at home and beyond.   "
