Jim Hagedorn,0.3385578691959381,R," Mr. HAGEDORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank ranking Republican Conaway for  yielding the time. I appreciate all that he has done for our committee  over the years serving as chairman and everything else.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Peterson for his service on behalf of  our farmers and agribusinesses. I appreciate him as well.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the U.S. Grain Standards  Reauthorization Act of 2020.  The U.S. Grain Standards Act of 1916 established USDA's Federal Grain  Inspection Service and has benefited all of agriculture, right down the  chain, for more than a century.  This reauthorization today will provide 5 years of certainty, avoid  potential disruptions to the grain inspection and weighing system, and  make modest but important changes to the program overall.  The folks at the Minnesota Grain & Feed Association and many others  in agriculture are behind this legislation. And let's not forget that  the bill additionally requires USDA to conduct comprehensive,  nationwide review of the agency geographic areas to report its findings  and recommendations and report back to Congress in 18 months.  I will vote ``yes'' today. I encourage all of my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to vote ``yes.''    "
