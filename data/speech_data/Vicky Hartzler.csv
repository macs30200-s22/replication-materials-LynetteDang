Vicky Hartzler,1.0901732444763184,R," Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the long-term  care and nursing home workers of Missouri's Fourth District, who have  witnessed the devastating effects of the coronavirus pandemic on a  daily basis. These frontline healthcare workers cope with the deaths  and illnesses brought on by this virus and are witnesses to the  heartbreaking losses family members experience whose loved ones pass  away without benefit of that final embrace before saying good-bye.  For these noble and selfless individuals, the impact of COVID-19  isn't restricted to emotional wounds opened through witnessing the  suffering of others, but by the personal physical health risks posed by  being on the front lines to conduct their day-to-day activities.  These frontline workers in our nursing homes and long-term care  facilities are heroes who have chosen to possibly put themselves in  peril by answering the call. They have been a source of encouragement,  hope, and help to our Nation's greatest generation, a lifeline amidst a  challenging time.  On behalf of myself and the caring families of Missouri's Fourth  District, thank you. We appreciate you, and we pray God blesses you in  a very special way during this special season and throughout the year.    "
