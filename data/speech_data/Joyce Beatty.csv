Joyce Beatty,1.2930370569229126,D," Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for  yielding.  I rise today to support this legislation because my constituents  desperately need the unemployment benefits, the stimulus checks, the  food assistance, the eviction moratoriums, the small business Minority  Development Institution funds and the CDFI assistance funds, and other  protections in this bill.  Seven months after the House passed the Heroes Act, Republicans have  finally relented to allow more support to the American people who are  struggling through the three pandemics: COVID-19, economic hardships,  and social injustices.  So let me be clear: The GOP has had a knee on Americans' necks by  holding this bill up, and it still falls short of what we need to get  through this crisis.  But I will continue to stand up for my constituents of the Third  Congressional District and for people across this Nation and my  colleagues to work with the Biden administration to get people the  support they need to build back better.
