Mario Diaz-Balart,0.0695809498429298,R," Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I  also thank the chair, Mrs. Lowey, for her long career helping working  men and women throughout the Nation.  I thank Chairman Price for working with me on the transportation and  housing title of this bill.  Mr. Speaker, this bill includes $230 million for port infrastructure  programs, which is crucial to coastal States, but also, frankly, to our  entire freight network.  I am particularly pleased that this bill includes $390 million to the  Maritime Academy Training Ship Program.  This bill also renews housing assistance for millions of Americans in  need. It is our duty to meet this commitment, especially for our  elderly; our disabled; and our heroes, our veterans.  I am also very pleased the bill provides $3 billion for homeless  assistance grants.  I have seen the results of those programs firsthand, as we  effectively eliminated homelessness among veterans in Miami-Dade  County.  As a final point on the THUD bill, I would note that this agreement  drops the controversial riders, allowing us to move forward.  This omnibus itself continues strong investments also into our  national defense. It funds Everglades restoration and prioritizes  school safety initiatives.  Once again, Chairman Lowey and Ranking Member Granger led the way  through these very difficult times by working day and night and never  giving up.  A final word to Chairwoman Lowey as she manages her final bill. You  know, you can agree or disagree with this honorable Member from New  York, but she is always honorable, straightforward, a true gentlewoman,  and she has been a huge asset to this institution and to our country.  Godspeed, Madam Chairwoman.    "
