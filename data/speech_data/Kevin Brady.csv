Kevin Brady,0.0994013547897338,R," Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Madam Speaker, this bill is a tax cut for the wealthy and a green  light for State and local politicians to raise taxes on local families  even higher.  The Center for American Progress and the Center on Budget and Policy  Priorities are liberal organizations I don't generally agree with, but  today, I have to say I do.  The Center for American Progress has made it plain. They said  repealing the SALT cap shouldn't be a high priority, in fact, that this  is overwhelmingly a tax cut for the rich.  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities agrees. They said  repealing the SALT cap, what Democrats are proposing to do today, is  regressive and overwhelmingly benefits high-income households. And they  go further and say this is little help to the middle class.  {time} 1415  It is a sad day when it is obvious to everyone but Democrats that  they are championing a huge tax cut for millionaires and billionaires,  while the middle class in America get zip.  Today we debate their insistence on hiking taxes on Main Street  businesses across America to pay for their massive tax windfall for the  wealthy 1 percent.  You think your local property taxes are high now? This legislation is  a starter pistol for a new race among State and local leaders.  Who of them will be first to raise property taxes, sales taxes, and  income taxes even higher on working families and local businesses?  These unpopular local taxes, frankly, are brutal enough.  This bill truly is a tax cut for the few.  According to the liberal Tax Policy Center, only 1 percent of  taxpayers in America paid more taxes last year due to the reasonable  SALT cap, 1 percent; in California, only 2; in New York, a mere 3.  The rest of taxpayers in America either received a tax cut or they  broke even. That is because the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  lowered taxes on income across the board. We doubled the child tax  deduction and expanded it to far more families. We doubled the standard  deduction so more working families keep more of what they earn. We  eliminated the alternative minimum tax for households making less than  $1 million.  This was important, because more and more families, including in  high-tax States, especially in high-tax States, found the AMT canceled  out their charitable and SALT deductions completely.  Another myth that has been debunked is that tax reform hurts State  budgets. It is just the opposite.  Many States across America enjoyed a windfall in new revenues, an  average of 6 percent, with stronger economies, more workers, and an  expanded tax base.  California Governor Gavin Newsom wrongly predicted capping SALT would  result in lower revenues for California. In truth, his State brought in  a whopping $3 billion more in personal income taxes than he predicted.  It was the same story in all the high-tax States, including New Jersey.  So the question is, what did these States do with their windfall? Did  they pocket these extra dollars or did they pass them through to their  families and local businesses by reducing State and local taxes?  To their credit, 13 States reduced their SALT tax burden, but not in  the high-tax States, who need it most. [["", Page , H12272, ]  States like New Jersey actually raised their State and local taxes,  while New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts are debating even higher  SALT taxes.  So if governors, legislators, and mayors keep raising local taxes  with a SALT cap, imagine how high they will raise them without it?  There is a price to be paid from high State and local taxes. In  truth, these are terrific States with dynamic economies and really good  people. But according to MoneyWise.com, the four States Americans are  fleeing from the most are New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and  Illinois.  Millennials, young people, are doing the same, but you can add  California to that list. These young people love their States, with  good reason, but they just can't see a future there with high taxes and  impossibly high costs.  In the end, though, why should low-tax States be forced, through the  tax code, to subsidize high-tax States?  Why should a farmer in Nebraska subsidize a banker in Manhattan?  Why should a single mom in New Jersey or a janitor in a building who  doesn't itemize their taxes subsidize the billionaire in the penthouse  who does?  LeBron James, an iconic athlete, legendary really, of the Lakers, he  will receive an estimated $2.4 million tax break next year because of  the Democrats' bill, but the janitor and the beer vendor in Staples  Center, they get nothing.  Gerrit Cole, a former Astros, is going to the Yankees as their new  ace. He will get an estimated $850,000 next year, but that parking lot  attendant at Yankee Stadium gets nothing.  That is what this bill does, because more than half of the SALT  deduction goes to millionaire and billionaire households.  Madam Speaker, the SALT cap of $10,000 is higher than the national  average of SALT deductions, and because of Republican lawmakers in  high-tax States, who weighed in aggressively during tax reform, it can  be used for property, sales, or income taxes. And the AMT, which is  worth up to $10,000 in tax breaks, was eliminated.  Thanks to pro-growth tax reform, our U.S. economy has roared into  gear as the most competitive economy on the planet, with the lowest  unemployment in half a century, paychecks increasing the fastest in  more than a decade, wage growth outpacing inflation by $1,000 a year  for average working families, American manufacturing is back, and we  have a million more job openings than workers.  America is once again a land of opportunity.  Placing a cap on the SALT deduction to let middle-class families--not  the wealthy--keep more of what they earned is a crucial component of  achieving this economic victory for American workers and their  families.  That old, broken, regressive SALT tax break for the wealthy has no  place in a fair, modern tax code, and the positive growth in America  since its removal is a clear demonstration of that fact.  One final thing: We often hear that limiting the SALT deduction is  double-taxation and unconstitutional. The courts and tax policy experts  have debunked these myths.  We hear a lot about moocher States, but the only moochers in this  debate are the State and local politicians who think it is their money,  and they are mooching off the backs of hardworking families and small  businesses in high-tax States.  I know my Democrat colleagues are sincere in this effort. But with  this bill, you have officially claimed the mantel ``party of the  rich.''  Madam Speaker, I strongly urge all my colleagues to vote ``no'' on  this bill.  And, again, I offer this: Republicans are committed to working with  Democrats to make our tax code even more competitive, to make our  economy even stronger, and to never stop working to help the little guy  in the middle class, and giving tax breaks to billionaires, encouraging  States to raise their taxes even more is not the way to do it.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    "
