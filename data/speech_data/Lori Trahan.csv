Lori Trahan,0.4876599013805389,D," Mrs. TRAHAN. However, for far too long, apprenticeship opportunities  have been utilized almost exclusively for just a handful of  construction-oriented occupations. It is time to open this successful  model to a wider range of careers and invite folks from a more diverse  array of backgrounds to participate. This bill accomplishes both.  I am particularly pleased it includes legislation that Representative  Morelle and I filed to assist small businesses in participating in  registered apprenticeship programs and provide a particular focus on  opportunities for people of color, women, and veterans.  At a time when college students are drowning in debt, we need to  advance measures that offer more affordable pathways to the middle  class. The bill before us will help countless people achieve the  American Dream.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair and Representative Davis for their  excellent work, and I urge the bill's passage.    "
