Derek Kilmer,1.1920127868652344,D," Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, it would provide priority for funding  through this historic National Apprenticeship Act of 2020.  Growing the number of computer science programs for students in high  school and beyond will provide more 21st century job opportunities for  our kids, more high-skilled and qualified employees for our employers,  and more economic resiliency for our communities.  I thank the chairman for his support of this simple, yet important,  amendment. I thank Representative Susan Davis from California for her  leadership on this issue, and I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes''  on this package and ``yes'' on this bill.    "
