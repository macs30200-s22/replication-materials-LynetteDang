Joe Courtney,2.6632678508758545,D," Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill and salute  Mr. Takano and Mr. Roe for their fine work.  In particular, I want to foot stomp section 2011, which instructs GAO  to conduct an independent analysis of the VA's 1-year manifestation  rule, which has unfairly blocked benefits for three debilitating  conditions caused by Agent Orange dioxin used in the Vietnam war.  In a nutshell, veterans are required to show these illnesses  manifested themselves within 1 year of exposure in order to get VA  help. Only one problem: 50 years ago, when servicemembers were handling  this poison, the U.S. Government never disclosed how dangerous it was.  When its toxicity was finally recognized decades later, the 1-year  clock to prove manifestation had long expired. It is the ultimate  catch-22.  Section 2011 would not exist but for the tireless work of Vietnam  veteran Gerry Wright from Andover, Connecticut, who has crisscrossed  America rounding up support for abolishing this rule--no lobbyists, no  super-PACs, just old-fashioned citizen activism.  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Gerry. He is a true patriot.  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill.  Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    "
