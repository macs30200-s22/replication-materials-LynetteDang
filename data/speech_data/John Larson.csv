John Larson,0.3807407915592193,D," Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, the American people are  incredibly frustrated, and rightly so. This relief package, while a  step forward, should have been passed months ago. House Democrats first  passed the Heroes Act in May; at the same time, Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell called for a `pause' and Senate Republicans refused to act  until now.  More than 315,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. Experts have  said if we had made a larger investment in testing and tracing, many of  these deaths could have been prevented. Millions of Americans are  unemployed and many are facing food insecurity. Our state and local  governments, including first responders, have been on the frontlines of  this pandemic but are being left out of this relief package. We can and  we must do more.  As I have said before, we cannot get the economy up and running until  we conquer the virus.  Today's relief package makes significant investments in testing and  tracing efforts, vaccines, therapeutics, and medical supplies and  funding for underserved communities, all of which are critical to  crushing this pandemic.  This package provides help for the millions of Americans who are  struggling right now. It strengthens critical programs for those who  are unemployed by extending and enhancing unemployment insurance and  rental assistance. It also offers $600 in direct payments to low- and  moderate-income Americans and includes a $13 billion increase in food  assistance programs to help the millions of families facing food  insecurity.  This bill also includes vital funding for small businesses, including  specific funding for arts and cultural programs and smaller businesses  who weren't able to access the initial relief funding.  These are welcome steps forward, but they are just a down payment on  what needs to be done.    "
