John Rutherford,0.0616288408637046,R," Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and good friend  from Pennsylvania for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Crisis Stabilization and  Community Reentry Act of 2020.  I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, as a former sheriff with over 40 years  of experience in law enforcement, I understand the issues people face  as they leave and transition from incarceration to a free society.  Throughout my time in law enforcement, I saw many individuals--too many  individuals--re-offend time and time again, often with the same  offenses involving substance abuse and mental health issues.  Part of the problem back then was, when a prisoner was released from  State prison, literally all we gave them was a blue bag for their  valuables and a bus ticket home. And we wondered why they failed and  returned to a life of crime--not much for rehabilitation.  So, when I became the sheriff of Jacksonville, I partnered with the  Florida Secretary of Corrections and community groups to implement  programs that provided continued treatment and services to individuals  during and after they left prison because those exiting prison systems  face numerous challenges as they go back to their communities, often  with little or no support from friends or family.  As my colleague just mentioned, the Bureau of Justice Statistics  calculates that one in seven individuals in State and Federal prisons,  and one in four individuals in jails, experience serious psychological  distress. Their battles with psychological distress and substance abuse  do not stop when they exit prison. In fact, they are exacerbated upon  their release. Indeed, during this transition phase, that support is  often needed the most.  Today's bipartisan legislation would streamline mental health and  medical services for these individuals, preventing a lapse of care  between prison and society, and, instead, creating a continuum of care  for those at greater risk of relapse.  The Crisis Stabilization and Community Reentry Act establishes a warm  handoff of care between law enforcement, community-based groups, and  mental health specialists. The partnership between law enforcement and  community groups is critical as they both share a common goal to lower  recidivism and ensure people can thrive and succeed when they return  back to their communities.  By offering grants through the Department of Justice, States and  communities would be able to provide medication-assisted treatment,  counseling, and other transition services that are prioritized for  those who need it most.  This bipartisan legislation is supported by the National Sheriffs'  Association, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the National Council  for Behavioral Health, and the National Alliance on Mental Illness, and  the Treatment Advocacy Center. [["", Page , H7216, ]  I am proud to support this initiative as a member of the  congressional bipartisan Opioid Task Force, as a member of the Mental  Health Caucus, and also as a proud member of the Law Enforcement  Caucus, because as a sheriff, I have seen firsthand and know the  success a bill like this can accomplish.  This bill is going to save lives, it is going to save money, and it  is going to reduce crime. With a renewed focus on those people in  greatest need, we can work together to ensure that pattern of  recidivism can become a problem in the past rather than one that will  be shouldered by future generations to come.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this bill, which, again, Mr. Speaker, is going to save lives,  save dollars, and reduce recidivism.    "
