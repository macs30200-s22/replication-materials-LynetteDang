Kurt Schrader,0.7918952703475952,D," Mr. SCHRADER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak against the CASH  Act. This is an ineffective and poorly targeted approach to aiding  Americans in distress. It is clearly a last-minute political maneuver  by the President and extremists on both sides of the political spectrum  who have been largely absent during months of very hard negotiations.  They have chosen to tweet their opinions instead of coming to the table  to get aid in the hands of Americans and small businesses who need it  most.  Over the last 6 months, and especially in the last few weeks as the  holidays loomed and COVID cases skyrocketed, the Problem Solvers Caucus  worked with Senators on both sides of the aisle and House and Senate  leadership to craft legislation that includes vetted programs like the  PPP and unemployment compensation that have been improved upon since  the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.  I feel for all of those who are suffering today due to financial  hardship and look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on a  bipartisan, bicameral basis to continue to find ways to help provide  relief.  People who are making six-figure incomes who have not been impacted  by COVID-19 do not need checks. We have had 9 months to fix this  program to get aid to the people who need it most. That has not  happened. Let's reverse course and target those in need.    "
