Amy Klobuchar,1.482625961303711,D," Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, today I rise with a heavy heart to honor and pay tribute to three exemplary National Guard Members from my home State of Minnesota. On Thursday, December 5, SGT Kort M. Plantenberg, CW2 James A. Rogers, Jr., and CW2 Charles P. Nord lost their lives when their Black Hawk UH-60 helicopter went down southwest of St. Cloud, MN, during a routine maintenance flight. They had just returned home from the Middle East in May after a 9- month deployment conducting medical evacuations. Once back in Minnesota, they had continued serving our Nation by ensuring that our Forces would be prepared to respond the moment they were needed. After this tragic loss, Governor Walz, a Minnesota National Guardsman for nearly 25 years, remarked that ``we will forever be in the debt of these warriors.'' I couldn't agree more. Today, I would like to honor these brave men for giving what President Lincoln called, ``the last full measure of devotion.'' We are forever grateful for heroes like Sergeant Plantenberg, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Rogers, and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Nord. Some who knew these extraordinary men described Sergeant Plantenberg as ``one of the most professional individuals . . . [who] had unlimited potential.'' Chief Warrant Officer 2 Rogers was said to be a ``calming presence'' who could always make those around him laugh. Chief Warrant Officer 2 Nord was described as ``lighthearted--and kind-hearted.'' Like many who serve this country, these men all had so many gifts, and our Nation is better today because of their service and sacrifice. During this time of unimaginable grief, I would also like to offer my prayers and condolences to the families of these fallen heroes. I hope they take comfort in the fact that their lives weren't lost in vain but in support of their common goal: to serve the Nation they loved. They will be missed, but never forgotten, as their service has inspired us all. So now, it is up to us to preserve their memory and support all of our brave men and women who make such an immense sacrifice to keep our Nation strong. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones and with the entire Minnesota National Guard community, at home and overseas. There is no limit to the respect they have earned, no cap to the honor they are due, and no time when we will not be in their debt. Thank you.<bullet>   "
