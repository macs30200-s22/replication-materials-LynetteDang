Angie Craig,1.5162893533706665,D," Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of "", S. 3418, "",  the Safeguarding Tomorrow through Ongoing Risk Mitigation Act or the  STORM Act, as amended.  I want to thank Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman  Peter DeFazio, Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings,  and Emergency Management Chair Dina Titus and Ranking Members Sam  Graves and John Katko for their work on this bill to get us to where we  are today.  I also want to thank fellow T&I Member Rodney Davis for being a  strong partner with me on this from the outset. I am also grateful to  Majority Leader Hoyer for scheduling a vote on this bill.  Finally, I also want to thank the diligent members of the Committee's  staff, particularly Aaron Davis, for helping us reach this historic  milestone. I also want to thank a former member of my staff, Natalie  Martinez, for helping to lead the introduction of this bill and my  Legislative Director Will Mitchell for helping to bring the bill across  the finish line.  Madam Speaker, by way of background, the original version of the  STORM Act was introduced last July as "", H.R.3779, "", the Resilience  Revolving Loan Fund Act of 2019 following a catastrophic spring where  Minnesota experienced one of the most devastating flood seasons on  record.  In response, I worked closely with local mayors in Minnesota dealing  with the aftermath of this flooding to develop the concept of a  resilience fund and establish a low-interest loan program for states to  fund pre-disaster mitigation projects which greatly reduce the risks  and costs of natural disasters. Revolving fund loans will be available  for projects that minimize the risks of wildfires, earthquakes, floods,  storm surges, tornadoes, and other events deemed catastrophic by FEMA.  The revolving fund concept is modeled after similar state revolving  funds authorized and funded by Congress for projects that have resulted  in a significant increase in the capacity and capabilities of water  infrastructure in communities across the nation.  It is our hope that our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee  will see the wisdom in the revolving fund concept and fully capitalize  this program starting in Fiscal Years 2022 and 2023 so that disaster  mitigation can see that same significant return on investment.  Madam Speaker, another benefit of this bill is that it opens up  mitigation funds to a new set of eligible folks. Currently, most FEMA  hazard mitigation programs restrict Public Assistance mitigation funds  if projects may accrue to the benefit of homeowners and businesses-- which can create challenges, particularly in rural areas of my  Congressional District with lower populations and large areas of  farmland. The revolving loan fund before us today is specifically  intended to reduce risks for homeowners, businesses, nonprofit  organizations and communities.  As a matter of process, Madam Speaker, I'm pleased that our bill,  like the STORM Act, moved through regular order on the Committee and  attracted bipartisan, unanimous support when it passed the House. Since  March of this year when the STORM Act was introduced, staff members on  the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and Senate Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs Committee worked closely together to  iron out technical differences and present a final bill that can be  signed into law by the President.  Throughout the process, we attracted and maintained the support of a  number of groups that partnered together to build the political will  necessary to pass this bill. In particular, I want to thank the  American Council of Engineering Companies, The American Institute of  Architects, American Society of Civil Engineers, American Society of  Landscape Architects, City Parks Alliance, Ecological Restoration  Business Association, Interstate Council on Water Policy, Mississippi  Rivers Cities and Towns Initiative, National Recreation and Park  Association, The Nature Conservancy and U.S. Chamber of Commerce for  their support.  As part of the Mississippi Rivers Cities and Towns Initiative, I want  to give special thanks to Executive Director Colin Wellenkamp and  outgoing Red Wing Mayor Sean Dowse--who were also instrumental in this  effort.  Madam Speaker, in closing, passage of the STORM Act will be an  important step in making our towns and cities more resilient. I'm  thrilled to be leading the bipartisan effort for smart, proactive  investments in disaster-resilient infrastructure.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) that the House  suspend the rules and pass the bill, "", S. 3418, '.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
