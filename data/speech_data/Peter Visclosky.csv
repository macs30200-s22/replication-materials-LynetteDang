Peter Visclosky,0.5253108143806458,D," Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding and  her kind remarks.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues support "", H.R. 133, "".  The Defense portion of this bill continues to focus on the well-being  and morale of those in uniform. For example, the bill provides an  additional $116 million for upgrades to childcare facilities and  directs the military services to present innovative ideas to address  the serious backlog for childcare.  However, I must also share my concerns over DOD and its lack of  compliance with many congressionally directed reporting requirements.  For example, last year, the committee directed the Department to submit  a report on its contracts for advertising services with socially and  economically disadvantaged small businesses. The report was 5 months  late.  The Department has also habitually redirected funding in  contravention of congressional intent. One DOD official referred to  these transfers of billions of dollars as anomalies. I refer to them as  habitual abuses. I hope in the future it will recognize Congress'  constitutional prerogatives.  Mr. Speaker, finally, since it was mentioned, this will be my last  floor statement after nearly 44 years of working in the House. I want  to thank all of the wonderful staff who have made what successes we  have enjoyed possible.  I also want to thank my parents, John and Helen Visclosky, and my  sister, Annamarie Visclosky, who believed in me when I was an  unemployed, young former staffer and made my incredible life journey  possible.
