Elise Stefanik,1.7880722284317017,R," Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of New York State  Senator Betty Little, an extraordinarily dedicated and effective public  servant for the north country, to congratulate her on her upcoming  retirement.  Betty has dedicated decades of her life to representing the  hardworking families of upstate New York, both during her time in the  New York State Assembly and the State Senate.  Senator Little first began her career in public service at the local  level, and served in many capacities while also working as a teacher  before her election to the New York State Assembly in 1995. She was  later elected to the State Senate in 2002.  Betty has accomplished countless legislative results over the years,  expanding benefits for military families, saving hardworking taxpayer  dollars, protecting jobs in the Adirondacks, and always standing up for  the people of the north country.  While petite in stature, Betty is truly a giant among public  servants.  Senator Little sought election to public office as a working mother,  a time when this was a lot harder and less in vogue. She quietly  shattered innumerable glass ceilings and paved the way for generations  of women to come.  I am proud to call Betty Little a legislative partner, a role model,  and a dear friend.  I offer Betty my most sincere congratulations and gratitude, and I  wish her and her family all the best in this next chapter.  It is my privilege to highlight her accomplishments in the  Congressional Record.    "
