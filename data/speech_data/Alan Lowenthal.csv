Alan Lowenthal,0.618179976940155,D," Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of "", H.R. 2, ', the  Moving Forward Act.  This bill is the product of collaboration across House committees and  takes a bold step to rebuild our infrastructure while reducing  emissions and enhancing resilience in communities across the country.  ', H.R. 2, "" makes key improvements that will address challenges we face in  Southern California. It ensures that states can use more freight funds  for multi-modal projects, critical improvements we need at freight  hubs. It invests over $100 billion in transit and has a dedicated  program to reduce congestion on our highways. And it devotes over $100  billion to affordable housing to help make sure every American has a  place to call home.  The bill also includes a crucial provision to examine the  administration of a fee on freight transportation. I have advocated for  years to implement this fee, which would provide a sustainable revenue  stream to fund sorely-needed freight improvements.  The Moving Forward Act tackles climate change in every title. It  invests in zero-emission transit buses and port equipment, incentivizes  the development of wind and solar energy, and emphasizes resiliency to  help our communities adapt to rising sea levels. The bill also gives  key federal support to expand broadband access and re-build schools  across the country.  This legislation is a bold step forward for our nation, and I urge  all my colleagues to vote yes.  I also wish to include in the Record a letter from the Chairman of  the Board of Directors of the Coalition for America's Gateways and  Trade Corridors.  Thank you for introducing the Investing in a New Vision for   the Environment and Surface Transportation in America (INVEST   in America) Act. We appreciate the robust funding proposed in   the INVEST in America Act and particularly support the   freight investment provisions which, with proper   implementation, offer the opportunity to strengthen our   nationally and regionally significant goods movement   infrastructure. While the COVID-19 pandemic has yielded a   great deal of uncertainty, it has also shone a light on the   essential nature of our nation's supply chain infrastructure.   When much of the nation was asked to stay home, the U.S.   supply chain continued working to deliver desperately-needed   medical supplies and equipment, food, as well as everyday   items previously taken for granted.  The Coalition for America's Gateways and Trade Corridors   (CAGTC) is a diverse group of more than 60 public and private   organizations dedicated to increasing federal investment in   America's multimodal freight infrastructure. In contrast to   single mode interests, CAGTC's foremost mission is to promote   a seamless national goods movement transportation system   across all modes to enhance capacity and economic growth.  As the legislation advances, we would like to highlight the   following for your consideration:  If top-line funding levels are adjusted as the bill moves   forward, Congress should seek to increase--or at least   maintain--the funding proposed for freight infrastructure   programs, including the Nationally Significant Freight and   Highway Projects program (INFRA), Projects of National and   Regional Significance (PNRS), and the National Highway   Freight Program. Annual funding levels proposed in the INVEST   in America Act through these three programs would reach   nearly $4 billion per year whereas $12 billion annually is   needed for freight infrastructure based on previous INFRA   application rounds. Decreasing the amount of funding   available to freight projects would jeopardize our nation's   ability to move goods through the supply chain quickly, cost   effectively, and safely. Not only is an efficient national   supply chain critical for COVID-19 relief--it will also be   just as essential in supporting our nation's economic   recovery.  We applaud the proposal's continued investment in   competitive grant programs, first through the INFRA program   and subsequently under the PNRS program. Competitive grants   are critical to funding large-scale freight infrastructure   projects, which are difficult to fund through traditional   distribution methods such as formula programs.  We support the increased flexibility for funding multimodal   freight projects, reflected in both the PNRS and the National   Highway Freight Program. Freight does not move on highways   alone--where public benefit is demonstrable, federal   investment should be made available regardless of   transportation mode.  We have a concern with the PNRS program limitation that   reads: ``the project will make a significant improvement to   the movement of freight on the National Highway System.''   This limitation, which also appears in the INFRA program,   challenges certain projects that are otherwise eligible and   meet the listed merit criteria and other considerations. For   example, port modernization projects that provide public   benefit but do not have a rail component are disadvantaged.  We appreciate the evaluation and rating requirements   included in the INFRA and PNRS programs. Clearly-defined,   consistent and transparent merit-based criteria as well as   public disclosures of application scores are critical to the   integrity of and confidence in competitive grants.  We support the creation of a task force to study the   establishment and administration ofa fee on multimodal   freight transportation. In addition to participation by the   Internal Revenue Service and the Departments of   Transportation and Treasury, we recommend the task force   incorporate public and private stakeholder participation,   including perspectives offered by the supply chain industry.  We commend the incorporation of several additional programs   and policy advances that CAGTC and its membership have   championed, including: establishment of the grade crossing   separation grant program; increased funding for the   Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements   grant program; designation of a final National Multimodal   Freight Network (NMFN) and including in the NMFN designation   ports with a cargo value of at least $1 billion annually;   updates to the criteria for the National Freight Strategic   Plan; and initiation of a National Cooperative Multimodal   Freight Transportation Research Program.
