Elissa Slotkin,1.2889918088912964,D," Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today, on the eve of a hopeful vote on the  next COVID relief bill that our Problem Solvers Caucus has so ably led  the charge on, I rise to tell the stories of three individuals from my  district. Their stories represent just a fraction of the messages I  have been receiving on COVID relief.  But today, on the floor of the people's House, I rise because they  deserve to be heard. Their stories are the reason we refuse to go home  for Christmas without an agreement. They are why we continue to fight  until a deal is reached.  First, I would like to talk about Bob, who wrote to me from Brighton,  Michigan. Bob is a pillar of his community. After serving his Nation in  the Army National Guard for 6 years, he has been giving back to his  fellow veterans for over 21 years as a district post commander for The  American Legion.  But for the first time in 16 years, Bob recently found himself laid  off from his job in construction due to the coronavirus. To cover his  expenses, like 171,000 others in Michigan, he had to file a first-time  claim for unemployment insurance. Despite being eligible for the  State's maximum benefit, he cannot make ends meet.  Between medications and health insurance, mortgage and car payments,  utilities and food, he is having to turn to his savings, and he knows  that won't last long.  Bob is responsible, a straight shooter, and he has served our  country. He is the kind of Michigander who anyone would want in their  corner, but right now, he is asking for help, not sometime in the  future, not after the inauguration of a new President.  He is asking us to pass a bill that helps the millions of Americans  who are in need. It is our job, and it is our duty to rise to that  call.  {time} 1230  I am also pushing for relief for Richard, who is from my hometown of  Holly, Michigan. Richard chairs our Downtown Development Authority  Board, which supports the businesses on Main Street, many of which have  been devastated by the pandemic.  Richard has had a front row seat to how critical the situation is, so  he wrote me, asking what the Federal Government is going to do to save  small businesses from bankruptcy.  I had the chance to talk to Richard over the phone this week, and we  agreed that small businesses need loans and clarity on whether those  loans will be forgiven or if they can deduct that loan in tax season.  This is what we will hopefully be voting on in the next 48 hours in the  update to the PPP program.  Richard and I do not see eye to eye on every issue, but when it comes  to our local businesses, we are residents of Holly first. We agree that  small businesses need a bridge to get them through the next year when  the vaccine will be widely available. After all, it is business owners  like Richard who have shown the grit and resilience needed to adapt to  these challenging times. It is only right that we have their backs when  they need it most.  Mr. Speaker, lastly, I am pushing for this bill because of Karli. She  is a server at Mackle's in Hartland, Michigan--where, by the way, they  have the best buffalo chicken wing tenders ever--and the best part of  the job for her is creating memorable experiences for guests who come  to share a meal. But these days, with the kitchen converted fully to  takeout, she is working half as many shifts and taking home half the  pay she used to.  COVID blindsided her and the rest of the service industry, and now  she is worried about the bills that are piling up. In between shifts  and stretching every paycheck, she is going to school to become a  nurse, joining the absolute front line of America's latest war. Simply  put, she can't imagine going into the new year with no extra help.  Mr. Speaker, she ends her letter with these words: ``Please help take  care of us so we can get back to taking care of you as our guests.''  Take care of us so we can take care of you.  Mr. Speaker, think about that for a moment. In the middle of a global  pandemic, one that has claimed 300,000 American lives and upended our  way of life, that is the mantra of folks on the ground, folks who just  want to take care of their neighbors and their communities. They are  not asking for the government to solve every problem, but they expect  their government to act.  For residents in my district, an agreement is more than just numbers  on a page. It is a ray of hope that maybe they will spend Christmas a  little less worried. It is a new year that they can truly look forward  to. It is a sign that, when their backs are up against the wall and  they need help, Congress can get in a room and agree on a deal. [["", Page , H7235, ]  Mr. Speaker, we are so close to that finish line, and so I ask all my  colleagues to join me in heeding the pleas of Bob and Richard and  Karli. Let's do the right thing. Let's pass a bill so we can help those  who need it the most.    "
