Mitt Romney,0.4144819974899292,R," Mr. ROMNEY. Madam President, I rise today to honor the extraordinary  service of one of Utah's most dedicated county commissioners, Mr.  Newell Harward. He has served Wayne County for the past 7 years, but he  has taken on responsibility well beyond that, advocating for rural Utah  with honor and distinction as chairman of the Six County Association of  Governments. Newell has had an esteemed career and life of service to  family, country, and God.  Growing up on the family farm in Loa, UT, Newell gained an early  appreciation for the value of community, family, and hard work. He also  developed a spirit of adventure, later serving a mission abroad in  Scotland and joining the Wayne County Flying Club.  As the founder of Harward and Rees Construction, Newell is also an  entrepreneur whose craftsmanship is literally built into Utah's  infrastructure. His company has undertaken everything from city water  projects, designs at Lake Powell, to a new bridge over Hell's Backbone  in Southern Utah.  Newell is perhaps most widely known as a public servant who was  elected to serve as Wayne County commissioner. After 4 years, Newell  considered stepping down due to illness, but he was undeterred. With a  writing campaign, Newell Harward was reelected in a landslide. In  October of this year, the President welcomed Newell to the White House  to recognize him for his lifelong advocacy on behalf of rural  Americans.  A true appreciation for Newell's life of service would be incomplete  without recognizing his unwavering faith and service to the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Newell has served in three  bishoprics, as bishop of a large ward, and in the stake presidency. As  a loving father to Kelly, Lynette, Sarah, Shonna, Carol, and Travis, a  grandfather to 18, and a great-grandfather to 3, Newell has left an  indelible mark on Wayne County, the great State of Utah, and indeed our  Nation.  All of us should strive to live our lives as Newell does, with an  overwhelming love of family and community, an enduring faith, and a  boundless spirit of adventure.  Newell, Gloria, and their family continue to be in our prayers as  they fight health challenges with great courage. May God bless the  Harward family.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    "
