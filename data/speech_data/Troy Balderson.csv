Troy Balderson,0.0695809498429298,R," Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Neil A.  Armstrong Test Facility Act. The Buckeye State is honored to have been  the home of American hero Neil Alden Armstrong.  From the Wright brothers to the namesake of this legislation, Ohio  boasts a rich history as leaders in the aerospace industry.  Born in northwest Ohio, Neil Armstrong made history on July 21, 1969,  as he uttered the words: ``That's one small step for man, one giant  leap for mankind.''  As the first human being to step foot on the Moon, Neil Armstrong  inspired generations of Americans to literally follow in his footsteps.  The United States owes a debt of gratitude to Mr. Armstrong for his  service at NASA through multiple space exploration programs, as well as  the U.S. Navy.  The Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility Act would honor this American  hero by bestowing his name on a critical NASA test facility station in  Armstrong's home State of Ohio.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the Neil A.  Armstrong Test Facility Act.  Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    "
