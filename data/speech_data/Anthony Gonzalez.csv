Anthony Gonzalez,1.6093690395355225,R," Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Neil Armstrong's heroism not only inspired a generation during the  Apollo era, but also continues to inspire generations today as we look  forward to the Artemis program.  As America looks to send the first woman and next man back to the  Moon, and as we look to Mars and beyond, renaming Plum Brook Station  would be a great gesture of thanks for Armstrong's service to the  Nation.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.  Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking Mr. Gonzalez for his work on  this legislation and to say how much of a privilege it has been to be  able to serve with him and work with him on the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee and on the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee.  Indeed, this is one among many ways that we have proven that there is  still the ability to work together to achieve common ends.  To my colleague, Ms. Kaptur from Ohio, thank you for your friendship  and support. It is an honor to be able to work on issues that  acknowledge and recognize the accomplishments of those heroes in the  Apollo program who showed us what it means to come together to achieve  something that has never been done before.  {time} 1630  As we recognize Neil Armstrong with this renaming of this facility,  it is in honor of perhaps one of the most well-known quotes of all  time. Because of the magnitude of that accomplishment, ``One small step  for man, one giant leap for mankind,'' was only made possible through  the innovation and the effort of Neil Armstrong and so many others  across this Nation who invested in the Apollo program.  As an Oklahoman, although we cannot claim Neil Armstrong but can  claim a rich heritage in the aerospace arena and have astronauts at  every phase of the Apollo program, I can think of no more appropriate  recognition of Neil Armstrong than to name this facility after him.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I urge a  ``yes'' vote. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms. Kendra S. Horn) that the House suspend  the rules and pass the bill, "", S. 2472, '.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
