Paul Tonko,2.492619037628174,D," Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, millions of America's restaurants are on the  edge of financial collapse. If we do not get them a lifeline now, we  will lose these pillars of community and economic vitality that have  long stood throughout our Nation. And we will pay an even steeper price  as millions more Americans lose their jobs and families are left  stranded with nowhere to turn.  More than 110,000 of America's restaurants have already closed during  this very difficult pandemic. Restaurateurs have adapted, have  reinvented, have dug deep to hold on this long. But more than one-third  say they won't survive the next 6 months without Federal help. In my  home State of New York, that figure is closer to more than one-half.  We can and we must act to save these cherished Main Street  establishments before it is too late. The House already passed a  bipartisan bill that gets the job done. With more than 200 bipartisan  cosponsors, "", H.R. 7197, "", the RESTAURANTS Act, would create a $120 billion  revitalization fund that would rescue America's independent  restaurants.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join us in this  bipartisan effort and pass the RESTAURANTS Act. Our Main Street  businesses have always delivered for us. Let us make sure that we  deliver for them now, when they need it so desperately.    "
