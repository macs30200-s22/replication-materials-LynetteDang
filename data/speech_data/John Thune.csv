John Thune,0.949413001537323,R," Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in 1906, two brothers named Nikolai and  Matthew Gjelsvik arrived at Ellis Island from Norway. The only English  they knew were the words ``apple pie'' and ``coffee,'' which evidently  they learned on the boat on the way over.  The immigration officials at Ellis Island thought that their name  would be too difficult to spell and pronounce in this country, so they  asked them to change their name. The names, when they got to this  country, were Nikolai Gjelsvik, spelled G-J-E-L-S-V-I-K, and his  brother was named Matthew.  So the immigration officials asked them to change their name, and  they picked the name from the farm where they worked near Bergen,  Norway, which was called the Thune farm. So Nikolai Gjelsvik became  Nick Thune, my grandfather.  He and his brother worked on the railroad as they built it west  across South Dakota. They learned English and saved up enough money to  start a small merchandising company and then later a hardware store in  Mitchell, SD. To this day, there is a Thune Hardware in Mitchell,  although the family sold it many years ago.  In 1916, Nick Thune married an Iowa girl who had moved to South  Dakota to teach school, and they had three sons. The middle son,  Harold, will turn 100 in a few days, and that middle son happens to be  my dad.  Like many of my colleagues, I send congratulatory notes to  constituents for big birthdays and anniversaries. I never thought I  would have the occasion to send one to my dad. I figured for this one,  instead of writing a letter, I would come to the floor.  My dad is a World War II veteran. He is a member of that ``greatest  generation,'' and he shares the qualities of so many in that  generation--humility, patriotism, quiet service. Dad was a Navy pilot  who flew Hellcats off the USS Intrepid, and he was an excellent pilot.  He received the Distinguished Flying Cross for shooting down four enemy  planes in one engagement. As a side note to that, that accommodation  was issued to him by none other than ADM John McCain, Senator John  McCain's grandfather.  But my dad didn't and still doesn't talk about his own exploits. In  fact, had it not been for my mom, I am quite sure I never would have  known about my dad's record in World War II. I did have the opportunity  to interview him for the Library of Congress's Veterans History Project  a few years back, and he shared some wonderful details about his  service. As usual, his focus was never on his own achievements but on  those of his fellow pilots.  I also probably would never have learned what an outstanding athlete  my dad was, had it not been for my mom. My dad grew up in the small  town of Murdo, SD, during the Great Depression. They didn't have a lot,  but there were a lot of basketball hoops around Murdo. They put them on  barns, poles, garages, and my dad learned to play. In fact, he learned  to play so well that he took his high school basketball team to the  State championship game where, although they lost narrowly, he was  named the tournament's most valuable player.  My dad had hoped to attend college in South Dakota, but there was a  doctor in Murdo named Joseph Murphy who thought my dad was good enough  to play at the University of Minnesota and used his contacts to get my  dad up to Hibbing Junior College in hopes that the Minnesota Gophers  would notice him. Well, they did. He went to the Twin Cities on a  scholarship and played three seasons for the Gophers. He was the team's  most valuable player in his junior year. In fact, he was high point man  in Madison Square Garden on his birthday, December 28, 1940.  In another example of how things have changed through the years, my  dad said that when his team came out to play for the second game that  night at the Garden, you couldn't see the upper deck because of all the  cigarette smoke. Some things do change for the better.  While at the University of Minnesota, my dad met a girl who served  sodas at a drugstore just off campus. They were married within a couple  of years while my dad was in flight training for the Navy, and they  spent the next almost 69 years together.  After the war, they came back to South Dakota. My dad had been  thinking about a career in the Navy, but his dad asked him to come back  and run the family hardware store. My dad said that his heart sank, but  he knew that is what he had to do. So he went home and went to work for  his dad. The hardware store did OK for a while, but started to  struggle. My dad sold it and went back to school and got a teaching  degree.  All parents are teachers for their kids, but my parents were teachers  several times over. Kids usually get a break from their parents when  they are at school. My dad was a teacher at my high school. He was also  a coach and the athletic director, and he drove the bus. My mom was the  school librarian. So I think it is safe to say that my brothers and  sister and I were pretty much always under the watchful eye of my  parents. I have to say that I never had my dad for a class in high  school, but my brother Rich did. Rich was the valedictorian of his high  school class, and the only B he got in high school was from my dad.  That was my dad for you. He never showed any preference or gave any of  his kids better treatment than anybody else. In fact, some of us might  argue that he gave us a harder time because we were his kids. But he  believed very firmly that you had to earn your achievements.  As a coach, my dad taught us about being a team player. He made it  clear that being on a team was not about building your personal  statistics but about making the players around you better. It is a  lesson I have carried throughout my life and one that I try to live by  every day.  A few years ago, the Jones County School District in Murdo named the  auditorium in Murdo after my dad in recognition of his service and  achievements at the school. It was particularly special since my dad  was one of the volunteers who originally built the auditorium back in  the 1950s. My dad would tell me the story that he was more scared up on  the scaffolding of that building than he had ever been flying off a  carrier during World War II.  You might think that with my dad as coach and athletic director,  sports were the main focus around our house. They certainly were a big  part of our lives. But my mom was determined that we would grow up to  be well-rounded people, and my dad always supported her in that. They  worked hard to ensure that we grew up with a perspective on life that  went beyond just the latest sporting event. Mom made us take piano  lessons and, during the summers, come in from outside and read for an  hour every day. We complained at the time, but I know all of us today  are grateful to her and my father for their investments in that.  Mom and Dad made a good team. Mom was an optimist, and Dad was a  pessimist--or, as he would put it, a realist--and they balanced each  other out well. We didn't have material riches growing up, but we were  beyond rich in those things that money can't buy but that lend purpose,  joy, and meaning to life. All of us Thune kids are very, very grateful  for that heritage.  I can't close without talking about something that was life-changing  for my parents, and that was their strong faith in Christ. My dad  always had real discernment and wisdom in no small part because of his  daily dependence upon God in his life. God blessed him with it. [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7223"">Page S7223</a>, ]  As we celebrate my dad's 100th birthday, I want to say thank you to  you for the example of faith, integrity, character, and humility that  you have given to me and to Bob and to Rich and to Karen and to Tim.  Thank you for faithfully serving God's purpose for your generation and  happy 100th birthday.  I yield the floor.    "
