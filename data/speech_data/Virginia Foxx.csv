Virginia Foxx,1.1664752960205078,R," Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, there has been a lot of  news coverage lately on coordinated efforts by the Chinese Communist  Party to infiltrate America's institutions.  I am particularly troubled by reports revealing efforts by the CCP to  exploit academic integrity on U.S. college campuses.  We know the CCP is using Confucius Institutes to further its agenda.  Located on college campuses across the U.S., Confucius Institutes use  their platform to spew Chinese Government propaganda.  While Democrats turn a blind eye to China's threat, I am proud my  Republican colleagues and I joined forces on the China Task Force and  made bipartisan recommendations to Congress on how best to counter  threats from the CCP.  There is no place for Chinese censorship in America, especially not  on college campuses where American ingenuity should take flight.  Congress must deliver a strong message: CCP propaganda will be met with  consequences.    "
