Kwanza Hall,0.0497006773948669,D," Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, the first wave of stimulus spending proved  frustrating for a lot of small and medium sized business.  Many mom and pop businesses ran in to loan processing problems  because there were problems with their applications.  Many applicants did not know that their applications needed to be  cured from any defects or that there were defects with their  application.  Some other small businesses were rejected because their lender ran  out of allocation because the lenders were focused on larger loans.  That is why, Democrats were able to secure $325 billion in small  business aid this time around.  Democrats secured critical funding and policy changes to help small  businesses, including minority-owned businesses, and nonprofits recover  from the pandemic.  This deal includes over $284 billion for first and second forgivable  PPP loans, dedicated set-asides for very small businesses and lending  through community-based lenders like Community Development Financial  Institutions and Minority Depository Institutions, and expanded PPP  eligibility for 501(c)(6) nonprofits, including destination marketing  organizations, and local newspapers, TV and radio broadcasters. $20  billion is included for new EIDL Grants for businesses in low-income  communities, $3.5 billion for continued SBA debt relief payments, and  $2 billion for enhancements to SBA lending.  This deal also includes $15 billion in dedicated funding for live  venues, independent movie theaters, and cultural institutions.  Small businesses that took a PPP loan and saw their revenues fall by  25% will be eligible for a second loan.  Congress will also allow PPP borrowers to take tax deductions for  covered business expenses.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.  Pursuant to ', House Resolution 1271, ', the previous question is ordered.  The question of adoption of the motion is divided.
