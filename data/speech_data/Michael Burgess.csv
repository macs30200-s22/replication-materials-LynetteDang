Michael Burgess,1.0068398714065552,R," Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, hearing some of the earlier discussion,  just for a data point, this is December 21, the longest night of the  year, as they say.  On August 21, the former Vice President, in accepting the Democratic  Party nomination for President, in his acceptance speech, said: Look,  let's be clear. No miracle is coming.  Well, here we are, 4 months later, with not one but two vaccines,  each in excess of 90 percent effective; absolutely phenomenal.  As another data point, in August 2014, the Ebola crisis was raging in  Western Africa. A vaccine was out of phase 1 trials. It took 5\\1/2\\  years to deliver that vaccine. This one was delivered in 10 months. It  is absolutely incredible.  Look, in the bill before us today, there are some high points, and  there are some low points. A couple of things I do want to point out.  The Independence at Home Act that I introduced with Congresswoman  Dingell several years ago was continued and expanded.  One of the biggest deals for me is coverage for immunosuppressive  drugs after a renal transplant. I have been working on this for 10  years. Now, we have provided additional protection for people who are  recipients of renal transplants so that they can continue to get their  immunosuppressive drugs.  Some flexibility has been provided in the bill to allow for value- based care. The alternative payment model threshold is frozen for 2  years. That is important.  Project ECHO, which allows for primary care doctors in remote areas  to be able to consult with specialists, has been continued. That is a  big deal.  The out-of-network billing has been tough, and it has been tough in a  year that has been tough on our Nation's frontline healthcare  personnel. The out-of-network billing language has improved  dramatically over the last 18 months. I cannot say that it is perfect,  but some of the more recent improvements, such as the prevention of  putting payment data from public payers in the independent dispute  resolution process, are pretty big wins for our physicians.  I will also add that it is an unusual time that they should have to  be facing additional cuts when our doctors have been on the front lines  of providing care for America's patients during this pandemic. Faced  with out-of-network payment reductions from the insurance companies and  with reductions through the evaluation and management codes, the E and  M codes, it is a funny way to go about rewarding those that we would  refer to as our Nation's heroes.  Still, Mr. Speaker, the American people do need the relief that is  provided in this coronavirus package.    "
