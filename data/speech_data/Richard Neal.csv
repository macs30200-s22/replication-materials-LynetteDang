Richard Neal,3.4301936626434326,D," Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.  I acknowledge the good efforts of Ranking Member Brady on the energy  front in the tax package, as well. It is a series of compromised  measures. He did a terrific job, I think it is fair to say, on surprise  billing, and not to mention USMCA. Those were very substantial  accomplishments that the Ways and Means Committee led on in the 116th  Congress.  Mr. Brady, as he was closing, mentioned that this measure he did not  want to see treated as stimulus, and he is right; this is not about  stimulus.  This is about stability.  This is about building a bridge for those people who are really  hurting as we turn the page on this year.  This is about those who are wondering how they are going to make the  next rental payment, sustenance for the American family, how they might  repair that automobile that sits in the garage idle because they  couldn't afford it.  That is what this is really about this evening.  I started with Charles Dickens and ``A Christmas Carol'' and the  lessons of Jacob Marley, but let me conclude with a very simple  description in ``The Epic of America.''  When asked what it was that set America apart from the rest of the  world, it was suggested it was a habit of the heart, a kindness and a  decency and a goodness. And let me close the debate on that basis and  urge passage of the CASH Act and $2,000 for the American people.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, "", H.R. 9051, '.  The question was taken.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    "
