Ted Yoho,0.8202536702156067,R," Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, one of the principles this country was founded  upon was the freedom to worship. This is a right that people all around  the world should have, including the people of Iran. Resolutions like  this remind the world that the United States of America will not turn a  blind eye to religious persecution.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch) and the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson) for their leadership in  introducing this bipartisan resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support "", H. Res. 823, "", and I yield  back the balance of my time.    "
