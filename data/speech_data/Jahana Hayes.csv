Jahana Hayes,0.3517171144485473,D," Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of the 26  beautiful lives that were lost on December 14, 2012, at Sandy Hook  Elementary School.  Mr. Speaker, 8 years ago, 20 innocent children and six selfless  educators were murdered in what should have been the safest places in  their community: their school.  Today, I ask that we pause, reflect, remember, and recommit ourselves  to working to ensure that this never happens again.  For many residents of Newtown, Connecticut, 8 years feels like  yesterday. Time has stood still for so many families as they attempt to  rebuild their [[', Page , H7169, ] community and honor the precious memory of their children and  educators.  Mr. Speaker, much needs to be done to ensure that our schools and  communities are safe places. We owe it to the 26 families from Sandy  Hook to work together to make this happen. We owe it to the over 38,000  people who will die each year from gun violence to do better. We owe it  to the 50 million people who are affected by mental health challenges  each year. We owe it to ourselves, because we are capable of creating  change.  Mr. Speaker, today, we honor, remember, and reflect, and then we get  back to work.    "
