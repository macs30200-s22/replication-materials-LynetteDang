Raja Krishnamoorthi,0.6397902965545654,D," Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, today, on the 102nd anniversary of  his birth, I rise to honor Dr. Govindappa Venkataswamy, an Indian  ophthalmologist who devoted his life to preventing blindness in India  and across the world.  Dr. Venkataswamy's work preserved the vision of millions of men,  women, and children, allowing them the blessing of sight and the  opportunity to enjoy independent, productive lives.  Though Dr. V suffered from a severe form of rheumatoid arthritis that  left his hands permanently disfigured, he defied all odds to become an  expert ophthalmologist and mastered the art of cataract surgery.  Having witnessed the terrible impact of blindness on those without  the means to pay for their own care, Dr. V pursued an extraordinarily  ambitious program to end preventable blindness in India.  In 1976, Dr. V and members of his family founded the first of what  would later become a network of Aravind Eye Hospitals in Madurai,  India.  The Aravind Eye Care System has been acclaimed by Harvard Business  School and is the focus of an HBS case study. It has also been  recognized for excellence in publications, including Fast Company,  Forbes, and The Wall Street Journal, and it has inspired healthcare  organizations throughout the developing world.  From its humble beginning in Madurai, the Aravind Eye Care System now  provides care to over 4 million patients and performs over 500,000  surgeries each year in hospitals and clinics throughout south India. [["", Page , H5113, ]  Dr. V passed away in 2006, but his legacy continues to give eyesight  to those who otherwise would be blind, and his story continues to  inspire millions.  His life is best celebrated by his own words:  When we identify ourselves with all that is in the world,   there is no exploitation. It is ourselves we are helping. It   is ourselves we are healing.    "
