John Joyce,0.3604261577129364,R," Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Great  Lakes Environmental Sensitivity Index Act of 2020.  I was proud to join Representative Kildee in introducing this bill to  direct the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to update  the environmental sensitivity index maps for the Great Lakes for the  first time in many years.  ESI maps document the potential impacts from coastal resiliency  threats such as oil spills, coastal flooding, and storm damage from  high lake levels, which have recently plagued many communities in my  district.  Having grown up and lived my entire life along the shores of Lake  Erie, I know that the Great Lakes are a national treasure, an economic  powerhouse, and one of the United States' greatest natural resources.  As the largest system of surface fresh water on Earth, the Great  Lakes provide drinking water for an estimated 48 million people,  support more than 1.5 million jobs, and generate $60 billion in wages  annually. That is why it is important that we work together to protect  and preserve the lakes and the communities they sustain. This  legislation will help us do that.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill today.    "
