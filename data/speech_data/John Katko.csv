John Katko,2.487712860107422,R," Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  In closing, Senator Hatch was one of the longest-serving members of  the U.S. Senate, often working on a bipartisan basis to get the work of  the American people done.  This bill will honor and recognize his dedication and decades of  service to this great Nation.  Madam Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    "
