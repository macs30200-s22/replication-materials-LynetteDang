Abigail Spanberger,0.950433909893036,D," Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of ', H. Res. 908, "". I rise today in support of my constituents of Asian descent.  Central Virginia is the proud home to a strong and vibrant Asian- American community. And since COVID-19 began, we have seen a disturbing  increase in hate crimes directed at the Asian-American community across  the country, including in Virginia.  Our neighbors, our fellow Americans, should never be the victims of  discrimination, violence or derision. And today, I am proud to stand  with them and support this resolution on the floor of the House.  We should all actively and forcefully condemn these acts of hate  directed at our friends and our neighbors, at home, across our  communities. And today, I am proud to do so with my vote on the floor  of the House. A vote that affirms the following:  That we call on public officials to condemn and denounce anti-Asian  sentiment;  That we recognize that the health and safety of all Americans of any  background should be our priority;  That we condemn the manifestation and the expression of racism,  xenophobia, and anti-Asian sentiment;  That we call on Federal law enforcement officials working with State  and local officials to expeditiously investigate hate crimes; and  That we recommit the United States' leadership to build a more  inclusive, tolerant society.  Madam Speaker, to my colleagues who agree with these principles, I  urge them to vote ``yes'' in support of this resolution and in support  of our neighbors. I, for one, will proudly vote ``yes.''
