Roger Williams,0.3267115652561188,R," Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the Central Texas  Food Bank for being a leader in the fight against hunger and for their  commitment to serving our community over the last 40 years.  Their generosity and dedication to our Texas neighbors is at the  heart of the American story. Last year alone, they provided 39 million  meals to central Texas families, including those in Burnet, Coryell,  Bell, Lampasas, Hays, and Travis Counties in the 25th District.  I was grateful for the opportunity this fall to join them  distributing food to veterans and their families in the Austin area,  and I look forward to working together in the years to come.  Mr. Speaker, I thank all the volunteers who are working around the  clock to provide food for families during a time that has presented  unique and unforeseen challenges, especially as we celebrate this  holiday season. By [[', Page , H6818, ] mobilizing our communities to serve and inspiring younger generations  to give back where they can, they are making us a stronger and a better  nation.  May God bless all of them, may God bless Texas, and may He continue  to bless the greatest country on Earth, the United States of America.  In God We Trust.    "
