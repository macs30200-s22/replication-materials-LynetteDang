TJ Cox,0.7862836718559265,D," Mr. COX of California. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the individuals,  families, and communities of California's 21st District, I want to  express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of being here today.  I am the son of immigrants who, I am sure, never imagined that their  son would become a Member of Congress.  Like my late father, I first started in chemical engineering, but my  career diverged when my wife, Kathy, and I moved to the Central Valley  some 20 years ago in order for her to start and pursue her medical  career, taking care of some of the most critically ill children in one  of the most deserving regions in America.  Mr. Speaker, the best thing I can say about myself is I am married to  her, Kathy Murphy.  For me, I began volunteering with Habitat for Humanity, and from  there, I can directly trace my path to where I stand before you today  as a Member of Congress, as a public servant. It is has been an honor  and a privilege to serve.  There is nothing more rewarding in life than serving others. As the  late Martin Luther King, Jr. said and professed: ``Life's most  persistent and urgent question is: `What are you doing for others?'''  One of my favorite family stories was about my grandmother, my lola,  in the Philippines, right after World War II, in Manila. She saw that  there was a segment of our troops who were being discriminated against.  They didn't have anyplace to go when they got off duty, no place to  hang out and have a drink or a meal or just hang out with their  buddies. So my grandmother, she took it upon herself to open the first  and only social club for African-American troops there in Manila.  Now, my grandmother didn't know or even ever speak to or meet our  friend the late John Lewis, but they were cut from the same cloth. They  lived by the belief that, if you see something that is not right, not  fair, not just, you have to speak up; you have to say something; you  have to do something. My grandmother did something.  That sense of social justice was passed along to my mom, Perla  deCastro, my children's lola, who became one of the State of Nevada's  first equal opportunity officers.  I am so proud of my children, Molly, Joe, Thomas, and Jack, who are  considering serving others in the Peace Corps, the Foreign Service, and  the Armed Forces. [["", Page , H7056, ]  For 2 years, I have been so grateful and so proud of my staff here in  Washington, D.C., and back home in California. They made a positive  difference in the lives of all the people of the 21st District. From  the 27 bills we passed, to the $700 million of water infrastructure  that we got passed through the House, to the over $3.5 million that we  got returned back to over 300 constituents, they were known to be  productive, effective, and capable.  Thank you to my team. You are a shining example of the adage, to be  successful, surround yourself by people who are smarter than you.  I want to thank all the House staff for making this place work, the  Capitol Police for keeping us safe, the ladies in the cloakroom who  kept us fed, the staff at the gym who kept us in shape; and to our  leaders--Steny, Nancy, Jim, and Hakeem--our Caucus is in good hands.  Thank you to all the interns who served in both my D.C. and district  offices. I am proud that you are considering a life and a career in  public service.  I am invigorated by the young men and women who want to make a  positive difference. They are making it happen, being the change they  want to see in their own communities.  My proudest moment as a Member of Congress was that day that we  passed ', H.R. 6, "", the Dream and Promise Act. A young woman from the  Central Valley who came out to witness the passage of that act said to  me afterwards: Thank you, Congressman Cox. You finally make me feel as  if somebody cares.  Beyond the legislation we worked on, my measure of success was to  provide an example that, if you care, advocate and work on the issues  that matter to you, your voice will be heard here in Washington. I do  care, and I look forward to continuing to fight to make a positive  difference in the lives of all Central Valley residents.  And we have to fight, Mr. Speaker. Democracies aren't taken away;  they are given away. I am proud of the role I have played to save our  democracy: first, in 2018, by taking back control of the House, and  this year, in helping win the White House. It brings a smile to my face  to be able to say President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect  Harris.  But there is a lot more work to do to ensure our democracy. Let's all  recall our pledge to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United  States from all enemies, foreign and domestic.  Let us recall that the Framers of the Constitution established  Congress first. We are Article I, supreme amongst the three branches of  the government. The power of the people resides in the Congress, not  the White House.  As this will be my final speech for the 116th Congress, I want to  say, unequivocally, I am proud to be a Democrat.  Now, sometimes our party is not great at messaging. We try to make  every voice heard, and sometimes we pay a price for that at the ballot  box. But here are a few truths that I am happy to sing from the  rooftops:  The Democratic Party has always been the party of working people and  their families.  The fact is, there is only one party that has consistently fought to  win healthcare for your family.  There is only party that will suffer the political consequences of  telling America the truth about COVID.  We are the party of purpose. I was proud to run and serve under our  banner.  I look forward to the Biden-Harris Democratic House and Democratic  Senate. We will get back to work fighting for the people.    "
