John Lewis,2.9553442001342773,D," Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of "", H.R. 7120, ', the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.  For far too long, equal justice and protection under the law have  been deferred dreams for Black people and communities of color across  our country. As we consider this bill, people throughout Metro Atlanta  and throughout my home state of Georgia are gripped by pain and anguish  over the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Rayshard Brooks, Breonna Taylor,  George Floyd, Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland, Philando Castile, Tamir  Rice, Jordan Davis, who was the beloved son of our colleague  Congresswoman Lucy McBath, and countless others. The pain in the depths  of our souls is constant and all consuming. It is the seemingly endless  nightmare from which we cannot awake.  Today, young people are taking up the mantle in a movement that I  know all too well. All over the world, communities are once again  joining the call for racial equity and equality. While their feet march  towards justice, their pain, their frustration, and petitions cannot-- must not--be ignored. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act provides  us with an opportunity to practice what we preach. While we use our  speech to advance American ideals such as freedom, liberty, and justice  for all, we must use our hands to implement these values. ', H.R. 7120, '  puts us on the right path.  Many may seek to mischaracterize this legislation. Some will ignore  the opportunities that this bill presents to improve our communities.  For example, I greatly appreciate that the authors included my  proposal, the Law Enforcement Inclusion Act, which permits Federal  grant funds to be used to recruit and train officers from the  neighborhoods they are charged to protect and serve. ', H.R. 7120, "" also  provides law enforcement with the help and training they need to  address mental health, drug use, and other complex societal issues.  These proposals are partial solutions to the historic disconnect and  distrust between communities of color and law enforcement.  Others may argue that the bill does not go far enough. This  legislation addresses one Federal part of a complicated puzzle of  entrenched, systematic bias and inequality, and we cannot let the  perfect be the enemy of the good. Going forward, we must demilitarize  law enforcement and establish empathy in our justice system. Make no  mistake--much more is needed from cities, counties, State, and Federal  authorities in every corner of our country. Our work is cut out for us,  and our mandate, from those whom we were elected to represent and  serve, is clear.  Mr. Speaker, a democracy cannot thrive where power remains unchecked  and justice is reserved for a select few. Ignoring these cries and  failing to respond to this movement is simply not an option. For peace  cannot exist where justice is not served. I urge each and everyone of  our colleagues to support this legislation.    "
