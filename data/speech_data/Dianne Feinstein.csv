Dianne Feinstein,1.1146390438079834,D," Ms. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the  ``California Desert Protection and Recreation Act of 2019.''  This bill represents a decade-long collaborative effort between  conservationists, the off-road vehicle recreational community, State  and local governments, small businesses, and public utilities. Through  this collaborative effort, we have developed a path forward to  sustainably and comprehensively manage California's fragile desert  resources.  Before I continue, I would especially like to thank Senators Lisa  Murkowski and Maria Cantwell, as well as their staff, for all of their  hard work to move this bill forward last Congress. With their  assistance, this legislation passed out of the Senate Energy and  Natural Resources Committee in October 2018 and was included in a  bipartisan public lands package.  Despite the disappointing outcome of last Congress, we have come  farther with this bill than ever before, and I look forward to working  once again with Senator Murkowski, as well as the newly designated  Ranking Member Joe Manchin, to maintain our momentum and pass this bill  as quickly as possible.  I also would like to express my gratitude to Representative Paul Cook  and his staff for their tremendous work and collaboration on this  legislation over the past two years.  The California desert is as special as it is unique. Unlike many  deserts in the world, our desert is abundant with plant and animal  species, many of [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S105"">Page S105</a>, ] which are only found in California. From the iconic Joshua Trees to the  desert tortoise, big horn sheep, and scores of wildflowers, the beauty  of the California desert is unrivaled.  I have heard from thousands of constituents who share a love for the  peace and tranquility of this majestic area, such as young students  from urban areas exposed to the desert for the first time and veterans  returning home from warzones finding much-needed quiet in California's  desert landscapes.  When I first came to Washington twenty-six years ago, Senator Alan  Cranston asked me to assume the mantle and carry on his efforts to  protect the desert by introducing and passing a desert protection bill.  Despite opposition, and even filibuster attempts, the California  Desert Protection Act of 1994 passed and was signed into law by  President Clinton. Since then, we have all watched the unique desert  plants, animals, and surrounding communities flourish, attracting  visitors from around the world.  The 1994 bill permanently protected more than 7.5 million acres of  pristine desert land in national parks and preserves, and I worked  closely with President Obama in 2016 to designate three new desert  National monuments that protected a further 1.8 million acres.  The original Desert Protection Act was a crowning achievement for  desert conservation, establishing 69 new Wilderness areas, creating the  Mojave National Preserve, and converting Death Valley and Joshua Tree  National Monuments into National Parks. All told, we were able to  protect, or increase protections for about 9.6 million acres.  I am proud to have been a part of these achievements for the desert,  and I remain steadfast in my commitment to get this legislation across  the finish line.  As I mentioned earlier, this bill represents the varied interests of  desert stakeholders and balances the many uses of the California  desert. I'll highlight some of what's in the bill now.  The bill designates approximately 375,500 acres of wilderness,  including eight new Bureau of Land Management (BLM) wilderness areas.  It expands Death Valley National Park Wilderness by approximately  88,000 acres and adds 7,141 acres to the San Gorgonio Wilderness within  San Bernardino National Forest.  This bill also expands Joshua Tree National Park by 4,518 acres and  Death Valley National Park by approximately 35,292 acres. The additions  to Joshua Tree National Park include 1,600 acres donated by the Mojave  Desert Land Trust.  The legislation also officially designates six existing Off-Highway  Vehicle Recreation Areas totaling 200,580 acres to provide certainty  that these recreational uses will be protected and maintained in a  manner similar to conservation areas.  Two more additions are the Alabama Hills National Scenic Area in Inyo  County and the Vinagre Wash Special Management Area in Imperial County.  The Alabama Hills National Scenic Area preserves 18,610 acres for  continued recreation and conservation. The Vinagre Wash Special  Management Area covers approximately 81,800 acres of Bureau of Land  Management land to provide for wilderness preservation, vehicular use  on designated routes, and limitations on extractive uses of the land  within the management area.  Lastly, this bill designates 77 miles of Wild and Scenic Rivers.  Desert conservation has never been a partisan issue. Over the years,  legislators have come together across party lines to preserve and  protect California's desert.  Considering our progress and bipartisan efforts last Congress, I am  hopeful this Congress will take this legislation up and move it forward  as quickly as possible.  This bill represents years of collaborative work and the interests of  a wide variety of groups and communities with the shared goal of  protecting and sustainably managing California's desert. This area is a  true national treasure, and I look forward to continuing our work to  protect it for generations to come.  Thank you.    "
