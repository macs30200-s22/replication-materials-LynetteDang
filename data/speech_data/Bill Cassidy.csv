Bill Cassidy,1.0840020179748535,R," Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the spending bill,  which we are about to vote on, which is going to increase our deficit  by almost a fourth of a trillion dollars over 10 years and of which I  think I might be the first speaker. We are going to vote on this. We  got it yesterday--Monday, maybe--and we are going to vote on it  tomorrow.  I smile because this is supposed to be the world's greatest  deliberative body, and we have not deliberated one bit on far-ranging  policies. Now, by the why, the mess is kind of bipartisan. We can  spread the blame around.  Let me bring up the heart of it. When ObamaCare passed, President  Obama famously said it would not increase the deficit by one dime. That  is gone. I think that replaces ``you can keep your doctor if you want  to'' as the greatest lie. What we did today is to repeal about $400  billion in payments to pay for all the healthcare that is going out. It  is kind of a joke on Republicans. We are getting ObamaCare, but we are  not paying for it.  On the other hand, as I will explain in a second, it may ultimately  be a joke on Democrats. Now, this concerns me because we didn't have a  committee hearing on it, and we haven't had a floor debate, but we just  committed that for almost $400 billion that have been used to fund  Medicaid expansion, people getting subsidies for their health  insurance, and many other things, we just went poof, and it is gone.  Now, some of it, like the health insurance tax, was a tax that the  insurance industry agreed to so that the Obama administration would  force ObamaCare upon the rest of us. But now that it has been agreed to  and ObamaCare is stuck, they don't want to pay the tax. They would  rather that go poof.  Now, people say: Wait a second. If we get rid of that tax, maybe  insurance premiums go down. One, they don't guarantee it, but,  secondly, what we could have done is we could have taken that money,  created reinsurance pools across the Nation, and that is estimated to  lower premiums by 10 to 20 percent. In that case, not only would the  insurance industry be fulfilling their bargain--hey, you stick the  Nation with ObamaCare, but we will help pay for it--you would actually  be able to use the money to lower premiums. That would be something  good. One, they would have kept their word, and, two, it would have  been good for the American patient, if you will.  The other tax that has gone just poof--$300 billion just gone without  debate, without deliberation, without a committee hearing, which is  still there on Friday, and today we walk in on Monday, and it is poof,  and we vote on it tomorrow, and I am the first person to speak on it-- is the so-called Cadillac tax.  Now, on the Cadillac tax, that is a provision under ObamaCare in  which for high-cost policies, if they go too high, you get taxed on  them. The whole idea is to encourage wiser purchasing of health  insurance. Now, frankly, I didn't care for the Cadillac tax. I get the  reason it was there. But 100 different economists have said that it  serves a purpose across the political spectrum. My preference is that  if we had replaced the Cadillac tax, one, we would have paid for it. We  shouldn't be getting ObamaCare without paying for it. Secondly, we  would have gotten [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7146"">Page S7146</a>, ] some reforms. They are reforms that actually would have been--if we  were not going to use the Cadillac tax to hold down the cost of  premiums--another mechanism by which we could hold down the cost of  premiums.  Why is this important? Because not only did we just go poof to almost  $400 billion, but because healthcare expenditures are driving our debt  and deficit. It is not just that we lost this $400 billion. We lost any  restraint upon policies going higher and higher.  Now, that is bad for the American patient. It is bad for the American  household because our country will continue its indebtedness.  I am a doctor. I know if you put more money into the furnace, it will  burn that much higher, and now there is just no excuse to try and rein  in those expensive policies.  It is not just that. One thing that my Republicans apparently have  agreed with Democrats on is to stop the Trump administration from  taking on something called ``silver loading.'' It is a little technical  here, but just hang with me. For the middle-class family in your State  who buys their insurance on the exchange and does not get a subsidy,  pop, there goes their premium.  How does this happen? When the Trump administration ended the  payments from the Federal Government to insurance companies, insurance  companies figured out a way around it. They are smart. They know how to  get out of taxes that they have agreed to pay for, as an example. So  they did what is called ``silver loading.'' They increased the cost of  so-called silver policies on the ObamaCare exchange. So if you are not  getting a subsidy, you are paying a lot more. But because if you are  not getting a subsidy and you are paying a lot more, that increased the  amount of subsidies for people who were. So if you are, you know,  getting a subsidy, you are probably pleased with it. If you are the  middle-class person making 400 percent of Federal poverty level and you  are paying your taxes and you are trying to do it right, you just got  stuck with a higher premium.  The administration was trying to take it on. This deal, which we have  not discussed, which was not heard in committee, which we have not  deliberated on at all, says to the administration: You can't take that  on. Yes, that middle class family not getting a subsidy is paying far  more, but you can't take it on. Stand down, administration, we are  going to stick it to that family, as well as saying poof to $400  billion.  Now, there are some other issues that are important to me in my  State. The National Flood Insurance Program is an important program. We  advanced some reforms that would make it more affordable for the  homeowner, more sustainable for society, and more accountable to the  taxpayer. We haven't had anything in there. We renewed it. I am pleased  that we renewed it.  We renewed it without reforms. You have had flooding in your State,  and I have had flooding in my State. You have had yours in yours, and I  have had it in mine. We need that program to be sustainable,  accountable, and affordable. We have lost the opportunity. I forget how  many short-term extensions we have had without reform. I think it is  like 10, 12, 14, or 16. You lose count after a while. We have missed  that opportunity.  So we started on Friday. Everybody goes home except for a few people.  They work on it over the weekend, they come in on Monday, and we get a  2,000-page bill on Monday. We will vote on it tomorrow, and I am the  first person to speak on it.  Now, I understand that impeachment is taking a lot of energy and  oxygen out of the Chambers. I understand that a lot of attention is  addressed elsewhere, but all I can say is that you have just imperiled  your country's fiscal health.  On one more thing before I wrap up, there is a little bit of an irony  here. Republicans are getting ObamaCare, but it is unpaid for. There is  another irony here as well. The courts today ruled that the individual  mandate in ObamaCare is unconstitutional. Now, I am not an attorney,  but I gather they did not rule that this was so-called severable.  If this is not constitutional, then the rest can stand because we  just sever it off. Imagine this. Imagine that the courts decide that  that portion of ObamaCare--which is related to Medicaid expansion and  is related to the exchanges in which people get subsidies to buy these  policies--is unconstitutional but would have allowed the mechanism by  which to pay for it to stand, because that is another part of the law.  We have just repealed that. Why is that important? Because if this  falls, we have to have the money to pay for a replacement.  Democrats have so long screamed that we need to have universal  access. By the way, I am a doc. I would like everybody to have  insurance. I fought for it, and I worked for it. But the other party,  which has said this is such a high priority, has just eliminated the  funding that could be used for replacement in Texas v. Azar, the court  decision that may strike down that portion of ObamaCare.  So, Republicans, we got ObamaCare that is not paid for. Democrats,  they may end up with no ObamaCare at all. Patients, whether they are on  Medicaid, getting a subsidy, or not getting a subsidy, will lose.  I hope that we can return to being the world's greatest deliberative  body, but as regards that, this has to be considered a low point.  I yield the floor.    "
