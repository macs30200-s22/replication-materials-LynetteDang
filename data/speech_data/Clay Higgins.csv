Clay Higgins,1.3229215145111084,R," Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon, the House will vote to  approve a $1.5 trillion transportation and infrastructure bill.  This American nation-building program will be the largest in American  history. The Public Works Administration of 1930s spent nearly $700  billion in today's dollars. This building program will more than double  that investment, creating millions of jobs in the construction trades,  jobs in the supply and materials industry, and jobs in the engineering  and design industries as well.  The program is good for economic growth at a time when our Nation is  desperate for economic growth. For every dollar invested in  infrastructure, that investment returns $1.80, or an 80 percent return  on investment, to the United States economy.  The President and both political parties have promised a robust  infrastructure investment. Now is the time to reconcile that rhetoric  with action.  Mr. Speaker, I urge approval of this bill.    "
