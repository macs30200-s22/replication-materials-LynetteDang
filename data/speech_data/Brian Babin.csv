Brian Babin,0.5621753931045532,R," Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of ', S. 1694, ', the One Small Step to  Protect Human Heritage in Space Act.  As an original cosponsor of the House companion bill, ', H.R. 3766, "", I  certainly appreciate the importance of respecting the historic  significance of the Apollo missions.  Mr. Speaker, I represent Johnson Space Center, or JSC, the home of  NASA's Mission Control and the men and women who made the Apollo  missions possible. JSC has a long history of developing spacecraft and  conducting missions in space.  From the very earliest Mercury missions that put the first Americans  in space through Gemini and Apollo missions, as well as the space  shuttle and International Space Station era, Houston has been the  anchor of our Nation's human spaceflight program. As NASA develops the  next generation of human spaceflight capabilities, Houston and JSC will  remain America's tether to deep space.  But while it is important to recognize and respect the  accomplishments of the past, we should not simply rest on our laurels.  We have a lot more to do.  Mr. Speaker, America does not look longingly in the rearview mirror  of history. We stand on the shoulders of giants and carry the torch lit  by those before us farther into the unknown. The bill before us  correctly balances these two competing interests: respecting the past  and enabling the future.  The Outer Space Treaty, drafted at the dawn of the space age, lays  out important principles for all spacefaring nations. It calls for  establishing the Principle of Due Regard, which respects the activities  of actors in space and creates a process for signatories to the treaty  to undertake appropriate consultations before any action that would  potentially cause harmful interference with another party to the  treaty.  More importantly, the treaty establishes, in its opening article, the  overarching principle that outer space, including the Moon and other  celestial bodies, shall be free for exploration and use by all states  without discrimination of any kind on the basis of equality and in  accordance with international law, and there shall be free access to  all areas of celestial bodies.  This bill directs NASA to continue developing recommendations and  best practices that protect this freedom while also respecting the  Principle of Due Regard and informing the practice of consultation  ahead of potentially harmful interference with the Apollo landing  artifacts. The bill also calls on [["", Page , H7222, ] NASA to include these recommendations in all contracts, grants,  cooperative agreements, and partnerships.  The bill does not create any additional regulatory authority.  Instead, the bill offers a carrot rather than a stick. If the private  sector wants to leverage the vast experience and resources that NASA  offers, they simply must abide by NASA's own internal policies.  NASA is not a regulatory agency, and this bill does not grant any  other agency any new power or mechanism to influence commercial space  activities. This will allow our Nation's emerging and vibrant  commercial space sector to continue to innovate, while also respecting  the rich archaeological, anthropological, historical, scientific, and  engineering accomplishments of the Apollo program.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Lucas, Senator Peters, Senator  Cruz, and Chairwoman Johnson for working with me to get this bill  across the finish line.  I also thank Chairwoman Kendra Horn for her leadership over the last  2 years. Her tenure as chairwoman for the Subcommittee on Space and  Aeronautics was marked by significant change and accomplishments for  our Nation's space program.  Her steady and fair treatment for all Members' interests should serve  as a shining example to this distinguished body. She will be missed,  and I wish her the very, very best in the future.  Mr. Speaker, I recommend swift passage of this measure, and I yield  back the balance of my time.  {time} 1615  Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by first thanking Ranking Member Babin,  as well as Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas and Senators  Peters and Cruz, for their work on this.  Particularly, I thank Ranking Member Babin. It has truly been an  honor to be able to work with his on these issues and to do so in a  constructive way that advances policy that is good for the United  States, for discovery, for innovation, and for our leadership in a way  that we can come together.  Space is one of those areas where it is and should be bipartisan,  where we can come together for the best interests of our Nation, to  continue to advance discovery and to encourage innovation.  Mr. Speaker, this bill does just that. It finds the right balance  between preserving the heritage of the Apollo era, for a reminder of  what we can accomplish when we come together to work, to advance  technology, to do what has never been done before, while not placing  too much burden on our ability to move forward into the future and  advance that discovery.  Our Nation's space program has long served as a source of inspiration  and innovation and helped make sure that we, as a nation, are a leader  in technology, innovation, and discovery.  Mr. Speaker, I encourage swift passage of this bill. I encourage all  of my colleagues to vote ``yea,'' and I yield back the balance of my  time.    "
