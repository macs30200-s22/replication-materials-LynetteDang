Rand Paul,0.6131629943847656,R," Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, we have before us today the National Defense  Authorization Act to authorize the programs and policies of the  Department of Defense. We will be taking a vote to finalize this bill  shortly.  Our national defense is incredibly important. It is mandated in the  Constitution. Our national defense is arguably Congress's primary  constitutional responsibility.  I have great respect and honor for those in uniform who serve. In  fact, I recently introduced a bill to give each soldier who served in  the War on Terror a $2,500 bonus and, at the same time, officially end  the war in Afghanistan. Ending the Afghan war would save us about $50  billion a year.  Unfortunately, the bill before us does not end any of our multitude  of wars. The bill before us simply continues the status quo and throws  more money around the world at conflicts we can't even begin to fathom.  Before rubberstamping more money, it is worth a moment for us to take  a step back and consider two things. First, we need to ask ourselves  whether borrowing millions of dollars year after year to fuel our  appetite for more military spending is a wise policy in the years  ahead.  Second, we need to look at how this bill has been loaded up to carry  things only somewhat related or not related at all to national defense.  As I have reminded my colleagues often, Admiral Mullen, the former  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the national debt was  our greatest national security threat. His exact wording was ``the most  significant threat to our national security is our debt.'' That was in  2010.  When he made that remark, our debt was only $13 trillion. Our debt is  now over $23 trillion. We just keep borrowing and borrowing, and there  is no end in sight.  Under the new budget deal passed by Republicans and Democrats, we are  borrowing $2.75 billion every day. In fact, we are borrowing nearly $2  million every minute.  We spend more on our military than the next seven largest militaries  combined. Our Defense Department is so large that it took them a decade  to even figure out how to audit themselves. Then they said that the  audit itself would cost over half a billion dollars. But then, last  year, they arrived back at square one. After all that effort, they  said: Well, we just can't figure it out. It is too big. We can't audit  the Army, the Navy, the Marines, or the Air Force.  We spend so much money that the Department of Defense literally can't  keep track of all of it. We don't have a great idea of exactly how much  we are wasting because no one can get a grip on how much is being  spent.  A few years ago, the Defense Business Board, which is a defense  advisory panel of corporate executives who report to the Secretary of  Defense, recommended that the Department of Defense can save $125  billion in administrative expenses.  According to news accounts, that report scared everyone at the  Pentagon, so they buried the report. They even tried to keep it away  from Congress for fear that Congress might actually do something with  it, although I wouldn't be holding my breath or too worried. I am not  familiar with Congress ever cutting anything.  We are set to spend $738 billion on the military this year. That is  up $22 billion from last year. Over the past 6 years, military spending  has risen over $120 billion. We say that we are for accountability,  efficiency, and savings. Yet we keep piling good money after bad. How  can we demand better accounting and efficiency when we budget increases  every year?  To be clear, I support our national defense. Supporting our  servicemembers is a worthy cause. There are things in this bill that I  do support. I am a cosponsor of the bill to eliminate the so-called  widow's tax, and I have argued that it is the right thing to do. We  should find the money to pay for it. That is in this bill.  I support returning the 101st Airborne at Fort Campbell to its full  air assault capacity with the return of a combat aviation brigade. That  is in this bill.  I support giving our servicemembers a pay increase. That is in the  bill. But I take issue when Congress adds other things to this bill  that don't have anything to do with our military.  This bill would sanction NATO allies and potentially American energy  companies if they have any involvement with Nord Stream 2 pipeline.  This is a pipeline between Russia and Germany. The pipeline is  basically done. It may well be completed in the next few months. The  pipeline will be completed. Yet we want to jeopardize our relationship  with our allies and with businesses both in Europe and America.  This bill would also drop more sanctions into the middle of the  Syrian civil war, as well as funding for so-called ``vetted'' Syrian  rebel groups. All this would do is prolong the Syrian civil war and,  with it, the humanitarian suffering and displacement we have seen in  the region. The Syrian civil war is largely over. I agree with  President Trump that it is time to come home.  Another problem with our insatiable appetite for more military  spending is that it requires conservatives to make bad compromises. If  you want $40 billion in new defense spending, then you have to give the  liberals $40 billion new domestic spending. If anything, that is the  real nature of today's bipartisanship: You can have your money as long  as we get our money.  The dirty little secret in Washington is that there is actually too  much compromise. Republicans want more military spending; Democrats  want more welfare money. And with each new Congress, Congress always  chooses to spend and borrow more money.  For example, this bill provides a new mandatory benefit program: paid  parental leave for all Federal employees, starting next year. The  program will cost over $3 billion forever--and most of these programs  continue to expand forever. The program will cost $3 billion a year,  and, of course, there is nothing in the bill that tells how we are  going to pay for it. So we are going to have paid leave, everybody, but  we are going to borrow the money from China to give this great benefit.  In essence, today, Congress is simply saying: Add it to my tab; the  deficit be damned. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, this  represents a better benefit than many working Americans enjoy, and it  has nothing to do with national defense.  Conservatism is more than supporting military spending at any cost.  We have to do more and make tough decisions that enable a strong  national defense and a balanced budget.  Many so-called conservatives will hail this bloated military  spending, but, in truth, there is nothing fiscally conservative about  borrowing money from China to pay for our military. In fact, I would  argue that borrowing money to buy more tanks or planes or to police the  far corners of the Earth actually damages our national security.  Some have argued that our military is hollowed out, exhausted from so  many far-flung conflicts--probably true. They will argue that we must  expand military spending to meet the mission.  Perhaps we should entertain the opposite argument. Perhaps it is not  that our military budget is too small but [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7065"">Page S7065</a>, ] that our military mission is too large. I, for one, hope for a day when  Congress rediscovers that our constitutional mandate is to defend  America first and only to become involved in war as a last resort and,  even then, America should only become involved in war when Congress has  debated and done its constitutional duty to declare war.  Until that day, I will continue to argue that the only fiscally  conservative, fiscally responsible action is to vote against expanding  the military budget. I encourage my fellow Senators to consider that.  I yield back.    "
