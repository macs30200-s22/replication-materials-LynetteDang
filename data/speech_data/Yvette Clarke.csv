Yvette Clarke,0.9882755875587464,D," Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  Uterine Fibroids Awareness Month.  Uterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors that affect an estimated 26  million women between the ages of 15 and 50 in the United States.  As vice chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee and a survivor of  uterine fibroids myself, I know that increasing awareness about uterine  fibroids is critical to our efforts to address the national maternity  mortality crisis and prevent pregnancy-related deaths.  While more than 80 percent of African Americans and 70 percent of  Caucasians develop fibroids by the time they reach menopause,  hospitalization rates for uterine fibroids are three times higher for  African American women and twice as high for Latina women. However, the  exact number of affected women is unknown because it is difficult for  healthcare providers to detect and accurately diagnose this condition.  This issue has not received the attention or funding it deserves.  This is why I was proud to introduce ', H.R. 6383, ', the Uterine Fibroid  Research and Education Act of 2020.  This awareness month is an opportunity to cast the spotlight on the  forgotten issue that impacts the lives of women of color.    "
