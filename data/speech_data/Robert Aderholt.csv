Robert Aderholt,0.0198802724480628,R," Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to lend my support of this  fiscal year 2021 appropriations package.  I thank the Chair of the Appropriations Committee, Mrs. Lowey, and my  friend, Chairman Serrano, as they prepare to retire for their many  years of dedication and hard work to this institution and I wish them  both well.  I also want to thank Ranking Member Granger for her outstanding  leadership this year.  I'm pleased that this bill supports the Trump Administration's Moon  to Mars Artemis initiative and rejects radical demands to defund the  police. It also restores long-standing Second Amendment protections  that have enjoyed historical, bipartisan support yet were excluded [["", Page , H7311, ] from the House-passed Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Act.  I am also pleased that this bill rejects issues which previously held  up a COVID relief agreement. This bill provides individuals, families,  health care providers, and businesses the assistance which we can agree  on, to help everyone get through this pandemic. It also looks to the  future by providing additional funding to expand internet access in  rural areas.    "
