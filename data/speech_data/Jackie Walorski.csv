Jackie Walorski,0.1391618996858596,R," Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans reach Medicare age, we need  to simplify the part B enrollment process and improve education and  outreach to seniors. The commonsense reforms in this bipartisan BENES  Act will protect seniors from unnecessary late enrollment penalties,  gaps in coverage, and unexpected healthcare bills.  I urge my colleagues to support this vital piece of legislation that  will simplify complicated Medicare enrollment rules.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, ', H.R. 2477, ', as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
