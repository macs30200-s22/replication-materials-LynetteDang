Gus Bilirakis,1.7130862474441528,R," Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of ', H.R. 2477, "",  the Beneficiary Enrollment Notification and Eligibility Simplification  Act, the BENES Act.  Unfortunately, complex and confusing Medicare enrollment rules  combined with a lack of notification cause tens of thousands of older  adults and people with disabilities to incur lifetime fines, coverage  gaps, and other harmful consequences. This is not fair to our seniors.  With fewer people automatically enrolled in Medicare and 10,000 baby  boomers aging into Medicare each day, more people new to Medicare must  actively enroll in the program.  To address this issue, the BENES Act is here for us. It directs the  Federal Government to provide advance notice to individuals approaching  Medicare eligibility about basic Medicare and Medicare Advantage  enrollment rules.  It directs Part B to begin the first of the month following one's  enrollment during both the later months of their initial enrollment  period and during the general enrollment period, closing coverage gaps.  It also requires HHS to submit a report to Congress on how best to  align the annual general enrollment period with the annual enrollment  period for private Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription  drug plans to reduce confusion.  And it enables HHS to create a Part B special enrollment period for  exceptional circumstances; a provision currently used in Medicare  Advantage and Medicare Part D when people are unable to sign up for  Medicare due to occurrences, like living in an area impacted by a  disaster or emergency.  I thank my colleague, Dr. Ruiz, for his leadership and partnership on  this particular bill.  Madam Speaker, all of these bills are so vital to our seniors, very  important bills, and I am glad we are passing them in a bipartisan  fashion.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues, again, to support this  commonsense protective measure for seniors, veterans, and those living  with disabilities.    "
