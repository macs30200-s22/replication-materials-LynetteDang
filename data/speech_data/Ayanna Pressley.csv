Ayanna Pressley,0.6695979833602905,D," Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the people who  are struggling and feel abandoned by their government during this  crisis.  I rise in solidarity with every parent who has struggled to buy  diapers and formula, every family behind on rent or crushed by the  grief of an empty chair at the kitchen table.  Our people are crying out, sick, tired, hungry, and broken. The  people we have taken an oath to serve and protect need direct cash to  survive the winter. We must send them survival checks immediately.  Some of my colleagues are patting themselves on the back for sending  corporations payouts--corporations, by the way, that have profited off  of people during this pandemic--and shaming families on the edge. Shame  on them for their theatrics and their callousness.  450 pennies a day for the last 9 months, that is what our government  has sent the American people to weather this crisis, and nothing for  the immigrant families who drive our essential workforce.  It didn't have to be this way. Our families deserve direct cash, real  survival checks.  Madam Speaker, $600 is hardly sufficient. It is an insult. We must  act to save lives now. The pandemic has not discriminated in its  hardship, but it would seem compassion and empathy have.    "
