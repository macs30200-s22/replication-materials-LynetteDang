Hakeem Jeffries,2.6289241313934326,D," Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to condemn the treacherous  and seditious behavior of some in this Nation who continue to poison  the integrity of our democracy.  The voters have spoken. The recounts have spoken. The electoral  college has spoken. Joe Biden will be the 46th President of the United  States of America. Over 80 million people voted for Joe Biden--more  than any other Presidential candidate in American history.  Joe Biden won blue States, like New York and California.  Joe Biden won swing States like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and  Wisconsin.  Joe Biden won red States, like Georgia and Arizona.  Joe Biden is the next President of the United States of America.  And yet there are some in this country who continue to peddle wild  conspiracy theories without a shred of evidence:  The Republican Governor of Georgia found no evidence of voter fraud.  The Republican Governor of Arizona--no evidence of voter fraud.  The Republican-led FBI found no evidence of voter fraud.  The Republican-led Department of Justice found no evidence of voter  fraud.  Republican-appointed judges throughout the country have found no  evidence of voter fraud.  The Republican Attorney General, Bill Barr, found no evidence of  voter fraud.  The Supreme Court, with six Republican-appointed Justices dismissed  the baseless lawsuit that contained not a shred of evidence of voter  fraud.  Madam Speaker, Joe Biden was duly-elected as the next President of  the United States of America, and yet there are some in this Nation who  are behaving like members of the Jefferson Davis Caucus, including a  former Member of this Chamber, who suggested that Texas secede.  Madam Speaker, it is time to respect the Constitution.  It is time to respect our democracy.  It is time to respect the voters.  It is time to respect the rule of law.  It is time to respect the peaceful transfer of power. [[', Page , H7167, ]  It is time to end this charade.  It is time to stop providing aid and comfort to an insurrection.  It is time to stop lying to the American people.    "
