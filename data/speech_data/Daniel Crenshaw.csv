Daniel Crenshaw,1.256818175315857,R," Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to unequivocally condemn, in  the strongest possible terms, the actions of the Speaker of the House,  Nancy Pelosi.  Just last week, referring to her obstruction of bipartisan targeted  relief bills that we could have voted on on this floor, she said:  ``Don't characterize what we did before as a mistake. . . . That was  not a mistake; it was a decision.'' When asked what had changed, why  she is finally coming to the table on COVID relief, her response was  simple: A new President.  We have known for months that Speaker Pelosi was holding the American  people hostage for political gain. I have said it; my colleagues have  said it.  While Americans suffered under unscientific, foolish lockdowns,  Pelosi withheld relief for political purposes--not policy purposes, but  political purposes.  But we now have a full admission. She said the quiet part out loud.  This was never about what was best for the American people, never  about honest policy disagreement. It was about preventing President  Trump from getting any credit. It was about politics.  Speaker Pelosi made a simple calculation. She bet that, if she could  keep Congress from reaching a deal on COVID relief, that would hurt  President Trump and Republicans and give her more power.  Even when Members of her own party asked her to bring commonsense,  standalone bipartisan relief measures to the House floor that would  easily become law, she refused. She would say over and over again that  nothing is better than something.  She was being honest. She honestly believed that nothing was better  than something.  But better for who? Not for the American people, that is for sure.  She believed that nothing was better than something for her and her  party. It is hard to imagine a more awful and heartless strategy.  What is worse, Speaker Pelosi does all of this while people in her  home State suffer from unscientific, unconstitutional lockdowns that  Democrat leaders in California are forcing upon their citizens.  These lockdowns are not based in science, never have been. Study  after study shows they yield little, if any, benefits, but they impose  extreme costs on the small businesses suffering under them.  Do you know what else? The Democrat leaders making these executive  orders, they know this, too, because they are violating their own  guidelines. The Speaker of the House couldn't even let a pesky little  lockdown get in the way of a haircut appointment, even though those  same lockdowns destroy the lives of her constituents.  We have all seen the heartbreaking video of Angela Marsden, the owner  of the Pineapple Hill Saloon and Grill in Los Angeles. Everyone should  have to watch that testimony, as Democrats shut down her outdoor-- outdoor--dining while a Hollywood studio sets up shop right next door.  She represents millions of Americans suffering who have taken note of  the hypocrisy of these lockdowns, of the double standards as big  businesses can operate freely while small businesses are shamed into  submission and told, wrongly, that they are the ones who must sacrifice  to slow the spread, that the demise of the business they spent their  whole lives building is the price to pay because ``if it just saves one  life.''  But this is unscientific nonsense and we all know it. Study after  study shows outdoor dining is safe, that outbreaks are not occurring  because of our small businesses: our gyms, our restaurants, our salons.  And yet these small businesses are in the crosshairs of the cowardly  politicians across the country.  This madness has to stop. This arbitrary application of executive  orders is deeply, deeply unconstitutional.  Justice Gorsuch recently stated: ``There is no world in which the  Constitution tolerates color-coded executive edicts that reopen liquor  stores and bike shops, but shutter churches, synagogues, and mosques.''  Americans have had enough. It is time to stand up against the  hypocrisy of these so-called leaders deliberately harming the citizens  they claim to represent and to condemn the deeply partisan actions of  the Speaker of this House.
