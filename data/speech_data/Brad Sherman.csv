Brad Sherman,1.7466120719909668,D," Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I will read it so that it is before the  entire House.  ``It is the intent of this legislation to provide the Securities and  Exchange Commission with the discretion necessary to determine how much  of a company's total audit must be performed by a firm beyond the reach  of PCAOB inspections before trading in the company's securities is  prohibited by the Commission. Consistent with our work with the  Securities and Exchange Commission on this legislation, it is our  expectation that the Commission will not prohibit trading in the  securities of companies under this act, as long as not more than one- third of a company's total audit is performed by a firm beyond the  reach of the PCAOB inspections. This legislation provides the  Commission with the authority to determine how an audit would be  measured, whether that be total revenue, assets, or another metric.  ``Furthermore, the scope of this legislation is not intended to be  limited to public companies which rely on foreign audit firms that have  some form of ownership relationship with a PCAOB-registered public  accounting firm. Specifically, it is intended to also encompass public  companies which rely on foreign audit firms that are affiliated with or  maintain some form of affiliation agreement with a PCAOB-registered  public accounting firm.''  Mr. Speaker, one particular comment to draw your attention to is that  it is not the intention of this bill to cover firms that have some  small part of their audit being done in China, perhaps one subsidiary  in China, but is rather designed to apply when a third or more of the  audit is not subject to PCAOB inspection. And how you define one-third  of the audit, whether that is the audit of one-third of the revenues or  one-third of the assets, or some other metric, is left to the SEC.  As House sponsor of this legislation, I have cosigned the statement I  have just read, prepared by Senator Kennedy, but would have the  following additional remarks:  I will take this opportunity to make clear, it is not the intention  of this legislation that every public company, which is a client of an  audit firm with a branch, office, or affiliate in a jurisdiction beyond  the reach of the PCAOB inspections, be subject to a trading  prohibition.  Instead, the trading prohibitions required under this bill are  intended to be applied when a significant portion of the audit is  prepared by an audit firm or the branch, or office, or affiliate of an  audit firm which the PCAOB is unable to inspect, and the SEC has the  authority to interpret this provision.  As chair of the Investor Protection and Capital Markets Subcommittee,  I appreciate how critical it is for investors on U.S. stock exchanges  to have the additional protection that the financial statements have  not just been audited, but that that audit is subject to review by the  PCAOB.  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues for their support of this  legislation, and look forward to its passage here today.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me enough time to  both describe the major parts of the legislation and also make it clear  to the regulators what expectations the House and Senate have for the  regulations that they will issue.
