Val Demings,0.8303555846214294,D," Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and  legacy of Mr. Ronald Rogers. Ron dedicated his life to public service  and to creating opportunities for young people.  Ron was a proud member of the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. and a  graduate of Florida A&M University. But above all, he was a proud  graduate of Jones High School, and he loved the students with all of  his heart and soul.  As founder and president of the Orlando chapter of 100 Black Men of  America, he worked hard to mentor students and provide scholarships and  other resources to help them during their college years.  Ron also served in numerous leadership roles, including as city  administrator for the historic town of Eatonville, where his vision for  Eatonville helped pave the way for the town's success today.  Ron never stopped, paused, or exhaled. He had an unwavering sense of  urgency about serving his community, about making his community better.  Ron Rogers truly made a difference in the lives of others, and we are  so grateful for a life well-lived.    "
