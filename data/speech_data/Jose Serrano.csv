Jose Serrano,1.935861349105835,D," Mr. SERRANO. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of ', H.R. 2420, "",  the National Museum of the American Latino Act. This legislation would  establish a National Museum of the American Latino within the  Smithsonian Institution on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.  dedicated to celebrating the significant historical, cultural, and  artistic contributions of Latinos in the United States.  With a population of more than 60 million, Latinos are the largest  minority ethnic group in the United States and the territories. They  have accounted for nearly half of the Nation's population growth since  2010. However, Latinos continue facing systemic underrepresentation in  the halls of Congress, Hollywood, academia, corporate America, and  nearly every aspect of American life. This disparity also exists within  our nation's cultural institutions, including the Smithsonian.  We must not forget that Latinos were here before the founding of our  country. They have fought in every American war since the Revolution.  They have also been at the forefront of every historical moment that  has helped shape our way of life, from the fight for labor rights to  the fight for gay rights. These stories are nearly absent from our  textbooks and classrooms, but they are essential to learning who we are  as a Nation. Simply put, Latino history is American history.  It has been 26 years since the Smithsonian acknowledged its own lack  of Latino representation with their 1994 report, Willful Neglect.  It has been 17 years since former Representatives Xavier Becerra of  California and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida introduced the first bill  to create a commission to study the potential creation of a Latino  Museum and 12 years since it became law.  It has been more than eight years since the 23-member National Museum  of the American Latino Commission presented a detailed plan to  President Barack Obama and the U.S. Congress laying out the blueprint  to get us there.  We cannot wait any longer. It is time for Congress to act.  Latinos deserve a dedicated space in the heart of Washington, D.C.  where our experiences can be shared with the world. Today, we finally  begin the process of setting that plan into motion.  I am proud to have led this effort in the House of Representatives  during the 116th Congress and my final term in office, along with my  colleague Will Hurd of Texas. This was a true team effort.  I also want to thank my colleagues from California, Tony Cardenas and  Pete Aguilar, for their tremendous efforts. From building record  support with 295 bipartisan cosponsors to leading today's debate on the  House floor.  I want to thank Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairman Joaquin Castro  and all my colleagues with the CHC for their steadfast support of this  project from the very beginning.  I want to thank Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raul Grijalva,  Ranking Member Don Young, and Subcommittee Chair Deb Haaland for their  leadership in holding the first legislative hearing on the bill last  October.  I want to thank House Administration Chairperson Zoe Lofgren and  Ranking Member Rodney Davis for favorably reporting the bill out of  committee.  Finally, I would especially like to thank Speaker Nancy Pelosi and  Majority Leader Steny Hoyer for their commitment in bringing this bill  before the full House of Representatives for a vote today.  I urge my colleagues to support "", H.R. 2420, ' and help get us one step  closer to turning this dream into a reality.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Aguilar) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, ', H.R. 2420, ', as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
