Jack Bergman,1.3701997995376587,R," Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of "", H.R. 7105, "", the  Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits  Improvement Act of 2020.  I consider the word ``optimism'' to mean hope that actually includes  a plan, and I have sincere optimism that the bipartisan legislative  package before us today will serve as a blueprint for the great work we  can achieve in the next Congress by working together. More importantly,  I have confidence that it will make a positive difference in veterans'  lives.  For example, "", H.R. 7105, "" includes my legislation, the GI Bill Planning  Act of 2019, which will give military enlistees greater ability to  consider which GI Bill benefits are right for them.  Just think, in the heat of the first 2 weeks of their boot camp, 70  percent of enlistees decide to pay $1,200 upfront to opt into their  Montgomery GI Bill benefit, but 97 percent actually end up using the  more robust post-9/11 GI Bill. By delaying this Montgomery GI Bill opt- in decision 6 months and responsibly ending new enrollment in 10 years,  we will actually save recruits money and ensure they are more informed  on their future education benefits.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for  including not only my bill but several other major measures that I have  co-led to improve VA transparency in benefits decisions, as well as  increase accountability in the Department's efforts to address programs  that are at a high risk of waste, fraud, and abuse.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support "", H.R. 7105, "", and I wish  Dr. Roe fair winds and following seas.    "
