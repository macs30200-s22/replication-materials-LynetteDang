Mike Levin,2.10245418548584,D," Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chairman, the rule this amendment seeks to gut dates  all the way back to 1966, and it has been in operation ever since. It  is the Excelsior Underwear case.  I have done hundreds and hundreds of house visits based on the  information provided by these lists. Now, just because it has been in  operation doesn't mean it has always worked well. For years, when I was  organizing, I was given lists of names and incomplete information  scribbled across scattered sheets of paper, and somehow this complied  with the law.  I am not going to admit how long ago this was, Mr. Chairman, but it  was decades ago.  The PRO Act simply codifies the rule regarding contact information to  make it work better and modernizes it by ensuring that, among other  things, contact information is provided in electronic, searchable  format, this being the 21st century.  Now, my distinguished colleague across the aisle might attempt to  scare you with nightmares about union boogeymen coming to blow your  house down; but, in reality, not one person has ever charged a union  with abusing the voter information list since the NLRB updated its  election procedures to modernize them in 2014, 6 years ago. Not one  charge; it is completely made up.  In fact, when the Trump NLRB, a body not exactly known for being on  the side of workers, recently revamped their election procedure, they  left this rule entirely intact, just as we are attempting to codify it  in the PRO Act.  Ensuring that workers are fully informed about an organizing drive is  paramount to effective labor relations.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    "
