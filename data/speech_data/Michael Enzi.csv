Michael Enzi,0.6424090266227722,R," Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory  limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to  those limits. In addition, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to  establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels  consistent with those adjustments.  The Senate will soon consider two measures: the House amendment to  the Senate amendment to ', H.R. 1158, ', the Consolidated Appropriations Act,  2020, and the House amendment to the Senate amendment to ', H.R. 1865, ', the  Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020. These measures contain  spending that qualifies for cap adjustments under current law.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 includes multiple instances  of cap adjustment eligible spending. The measure includes $70,855  million in spending designated as being for overseas contingency  operations, OCO, funding pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of  BBEDCA. This budget authority, all of which falls into the revised  security category, would result in $40,336 million in outlays in fiscal  year 2020. The measure further includes $17,503 million in spending  designated for disaster relief pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(D) of  BBEDCA. This budget authority, all of which falls into the revised  nonsecurity category, would result in $984 million in outlays. The  measure also includes $1,771 million in revised security category  budget authority that is designated as an emergency pursuant to section  251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA. CBO estimates that this budget authority, as  well as other emergency designated changes, would increase net outlays  by $914 million this fiscal year.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, also includes $2,500  million in nonsecurity budget authority that is designated as being for  the periodic U.S. Census pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(G) of BBEDCA.  CBO estimates that this budget authority will result in $1,800 million  in outlays in fiscal year 2020. Earlier this year, I made an adjustment  to accommodate funding in this amount for this purpose and reaffirm  those funds for use for this measure.  The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 also includes  multiple instances of cap adjustment eligible spending. The measure  includes $8,645 million in spending designated as being for OCO funding  pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of BBEDCA. This budget authority,  $645 million of which falls into the revised security category and  $8,000 million falls into the revised nonsecurity category, would  result in $2,327 million in outlays in fiscal year 2020. The measure  includes $1,842 million in spending designated for program integrity  pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(B), section 251(b)(2)(C), and section  251(b)(2)(E) of BBEDCA. This budget authority, all of which falls into  the revised nonsecurity category, would result in $1,481 million in  outlays. The measure also includes $6,764 million in revised  nonsecurity category budget authority that is designated as an  emergency pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA. CBO estimates  that this budget authority, as well as other emergency designated  changes, would increase net outlays by $1,705 million this fiscal year.  The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 also includes  $2,250 million in nonsecurity discretionary budget authority for  wildfire suppression operations pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(F) of  BBEDCA. This budget authority and its associated outlays of $2,250  million qualify for an adjustment under the law. Earlier this year, I  made an adjustment to accommodate funding in this amount for this  purpose and reaffirm those funds for use for this measure. As such, I  am revising the budget authority and outlay allocations to the  Committee on Appropriations by increasing revised nonsecurity budget  authority by $27,880 million, revised security budget authority by  $79,500 million, and general outlays by $47,747 million in fiscal year  2020. Further, I am increasing the budgetary aggregate for fiscal year  2020 by $107,126 million in budget authority and $47,534 million in  outlays.  I ask unanimous consent that this notice and the accompanying tables,  which provide details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows: "
