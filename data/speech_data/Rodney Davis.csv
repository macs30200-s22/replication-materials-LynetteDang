Rodney Davis,0.7845510840415955,R," Ms. DAVIS of California. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for  yielding, and I thank Chairman Scott for his leadership on this bill.  This bill is named after the late Congressman Elijah Cummings for his  great work fighting for affordable healthcare and prescription drugs.  He fought for people like a constituent of mine who wrote to me  regarding the absurdly high cost of insulin. He explained in this  letter that his brother had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, which  requires him to take an insulin injection four times a day. My  colleagues are probably familiar with that, people they know. A single  bottle of insulin costs $400. He tells me that some people skip  needles. Others let themselves stay at harmful blood sugar levels so  that they can make their insulin last longer.  Madam Chair, no one should have to suffer this indignity, especially  when in many places around the world, insulin is as low as $8.  With ', H.R. 3, "", Medicare will be able to negotiate drug prices for  seniors and beneficiaries, and our constituents won't be plagued by  such high costs for such a common drug.  {time} 2045  And thanks to this bill, the NIH will have more resources to  encourage more research and more experimentation. The savings can be  used for large projects and for new pilot initiatives to assist the  development of new cures and treatments, and this can really be  groundbreaking for all of us.  I supported this bill in committee because it boosts the economy by  saving both American workers and businesses billions of dollars. We all  know what that can mean.  Madam Chair, I encourage my colleagues to vote for the underlying  legislation.    "
