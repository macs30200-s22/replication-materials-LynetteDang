Charlie Crist,1.2312413454055786,D," Mr. CRIST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life's work  of a very honorable civil servant who has given so much to Pinellas  County and the City of Clearwater over his long, accomplished, and  selfless career.  George Cretekos has devoted his life to public service, over 5  decades of unwavering commitment to his fellow [["", Page , H6913, ] Floridians, exemplified by deep community involvement, civility, and  practical commonsense decisionmaking. George is a Republican and is my  dear friend.  {time} 1045  George got his start working for St. Petersburg Congressman Bill  Cramer. Upon Mr. Cramer's retirement, he began an extraordinary 35-year  run with Representative Cramer's successor, Congressman Bill Young.  George served on his Washington, D.C., staff and was best known  throughout the county as Congressman Young's longtime district  director.  In 2007, he made the jump to elected office himself, joining the  Clearwater City Council. George served on the council for 5 years  before rising to the mayor's office in 2012. At city hall, Mayor  Cretekos governed Clearwater with unfaltering professionalism,  shepherding major initiatives such as the $60-plus million Imagine  Clearwater downtown waterfront restoration project. In addition to his  mayoral role, he served as the president of the Barrier Islands  Government Council and the Pinellas County Mayors' Council.  Throughout his public career, he was first to listen, quick to find  compromise, and, foremost, committed to the well-being of his  constituents.  I have known George for many, many years. He has always gone out of  his way to look out for ways in our community to help out, large and  small. He served on the OneBlood Tampa Bay area board, donating over 60  gallons of blood during his lifetime. He continues to be a volunteer  courier for the National Bone Marrow Donor Program and remains very  involved with the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church in Clearwater,  Florida.  He was awarded numerous accolades for his contributions, notably from  the Salvation Army as well as the Greater Tampa Bay Area Council of the  Boy Scouts of America.  George was an elected official, but he was never afraid to roll up  his sleeves and quietly do the hard work behind the scenes. He has  volunteered to build homes for Habitat for Humanity. He helped with the  Clearwater Jazz Festival. He serves dinners for the needy. He has  worked 12-plus-hour shifts for days on end as a Pinellas County poll  worker.  Mr. Speaker, please join me, once again, in commemorating the career  of Mayor George Cretekos--my fellow Greek, by the way--recognizing his  outstanding service and dedication to our community.  He has served admirably, with humility. His leadership and character  distinguish him as a gold standard for public service. His good works  will be remembered for decades to come.    "
