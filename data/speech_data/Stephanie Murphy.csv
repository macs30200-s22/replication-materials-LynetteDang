Stephanie Murphy,0.6254110336303711,D," Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the political  status of Puerto Rico, which is home to more than three million  American citizens.  In my home State of Florida, there are now 1.2 million people who  were born in Puerto Rico or who have Puerto Rican roots. That is more  than any other State.  Every month, many Puerto Ricans move to Florida and other States in  search of a brighter future. The island has been through so much--from  the economic crisis, to Hurricane Maria, to the earthquakes, to COVID- 19.  In Florida, we will always welcome these families with open arms, but  I want them to have more opportunities in Puerto Rico. I don't want  them to feel like they have no alternative but to leave their beloved  home.  In my Orlando district, most of my Puerto Rican constituents have  family members and friends still living on the island. Because they  care deeply about Puerto Rico, I care deeply about Puerto Rico.  But every Member of Congress should care about Puerto Rico because  Puerto Ricans are our fellow American citizens. We are part of the same  American family, even though the hard truth is that the United States  hasn't always treated Puerto Rico very well.  Our country now has the chance to do right by Puerto Rico.  That is because on November 3, Puerto Rico held a vote on its  political status. In a referendum, the people of Puerto Rico were asked  the following question: ``Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately  into the Union as a State?'' Yes or no?  Even though Puerto Rico has been a U.S. territory since 1898, and the  island residents have been American citizens since 1917, this was the  first time the people of Puerto Rico were asked this simple and direct  question.  According to the results, over 52 percent of voters, more than  623,000 people, answered ``yes,'' while nearly 48 percent of voters  answered ``no.''  The vote was fair, and the results were clear.  At this point, it is beyond dispute that a majority of the American  citizens living in Puerto Rico want the territory to become a State.  Now, are there people in Puerto Rico who would prefer for the island  to remain a territory or to become a sovereign nation? Absolutely. And  that is completely valid and legitimate.  But when it comes to the political destiny of a place, the views of  the minority cannot trump or take precedence over the views of the  majority. That would turn the concept of democracy on its head. Votes  matter.  And now that the people of Puerto Rico have spoken, the Federal  Government must listen. Whether it is the White House or Congress,  whether it is Democrats or Republicans, we must respect and respond to  this result.  To do otherwise would be immoral or undemocratic, beneath the dignity  of our great Nation.  Let me be crystal clear on two points so there is no  misunderstanding.  First, it is well known that I personally support statehood because I  think it will provide the people of Puerto Rico with democracy and  equality and political power and a better quality of life. They do not  have these things right now and they deserve to have them.  By the way, I am an immigrant and a refugee. I grew up in Virginia  speaking Vietnamese with my parents. One of the main reasons I love  America is because it is a mix of people from different cultures with  different traditions who speak different languages. I reject the notion  that statehood would weaken Puerto Rico's beautiful culture or its  proud traditions or affect the island's use of the Spanish language.  Having said all this, even though I personally favor statehood, it is  not my place to substitute my views for the views of the people of  Puerto Rico.  If they wished to remain a territory or become a nation, I would  honor that wish.  However, the majority of voters have chosen statehood, and so I  intend to respect that choice.  Finally, let me say this: I am a Democrat, but my support for  statehood has nothing to do with any prediction about whether Puerto  Rico would be a blue State or a red State. History teaches us that such  predictions tend to be wrong, and I personally think Puerto Rico would  be a swing State that elects both Democrats and Republicans.  However, I would support statehood for Puerto Rico if it were as  Republican as Wyoming or as Democratic as Vermont. To oppose statehood  because you fear the people will not vote the way you want them to vote  violates the most basic principles of justice and democracy, and I have  zero patience for that.  In the coming weeks, I will work with Puerto Rico's governor-elect,  resident commissioner, and legislative assembly, with the incoming  Biden administration, and with my congressional colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to determine the best path forward.  I cannot promise a particular result, but I can promise I will never  stop fighting for equality for the American citizens of Puerto Rico.    "
