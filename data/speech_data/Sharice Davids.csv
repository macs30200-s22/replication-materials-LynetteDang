Sharice Davids,0.6572354435920715,D," Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  service of Mayor Michael Copeland, who passed away on August 19, 2020.  Mayor Copeland was a devoted father and husband. He is survived by  his wife, Maria, and three children, Olivia, Abigail, and Joshua.  As Olathe's longest serving mayor, he was elected in 2001 and held  the office until his passing.  Mayor Copeland leaves behind a legacy that has touched the lives of  many in the Olathe community.  Personally, I will miss Mayor Copeland's counsel. I very much  appreciated each one of our many conversations since I took office. He  was always generous with his time and knowledge, willing and eager to  represent the people of Olathe.  Mr. Speaker, I offer my deepest condolences to Mayor Copeland's  family and friends and to all of those who will miss his kindness and  leadership. This truly is a loss for Kansas and our community.    "
