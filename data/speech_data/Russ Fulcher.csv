Russ Fulcher,0.2324354797601699,R," Mr. FULCHER. Madam Speaker, I stand in opposition to ', H.R. 4447, '. A  clean energy future is not possible without advanced nuclear energy.  We are in a global competition. Russia is building seven reactors in  Asia, has 22 more under contract in Asia and Europe, and proposals to  put more in Africa. China is on pace to double nuclear capacity by 2030  and has stated it wants to build 6 to 8 reactors a year. In the U.S. we  are currently building two.  If we fall behind, so does our national security and geopolitical  standing.  That is why I introduced the Next Generation Nuclear Advancement Act,  which was ruled out of order as an amendment. All sections of this act,  the Nuclear Energy Strategic Plan, and Integrated Energy and Light  Water Reactor Programs, have Senate counterparts with bipartisan  support.  These provisions need to be inserted for legislation to have a chance  at becoming law; anything less is only useful as a social media post.    "
