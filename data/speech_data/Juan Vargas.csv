Juan Vargas,0.9062404036521912,D," Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of International  Women's Day.  Throughout our past, many men have been recognized for their impact  on our society; however, it is extremely important that we recognize  the many women who fueled social change.  Helen Fabela Chavez was one of these women.  Helen was born on January 21, 1928, in Brawley, California, a city in  my district. Like many Chicano children in the early 20th century,  Helen began working in the agricultural industry at the age of 7.  After marrying Cesar Chavez in 1948, Helen left the workforce to take  care of her husband and their eight children.  However, after 10 years, Helen returned to the workforce as the  breadwinner for the family while Cesar Chavez began to establish the  National Farm Workers Association.  Helen and other Chicana members contributed greatly to the success of  the union, and she later became the treasurer for what became the  United Farm Workers.  I want to honor Helen Fabela Chavez, a woman who both raised and  financially supported her family while also changing history from the  grassroots up.    "
