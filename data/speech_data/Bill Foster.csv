Bill Foster,0.6958767175674438,D," Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Clean Economy  Jobs and Innovation Act.  This act includes provisions from the bipartisan ', H.R. 2986, "", the  Better Energy Storage Act, or BEST Act, led by me, Mr. Casten, Ms.  Herrera Beutler, and Mr. Gonzalez.  These provisions set forth a crosscutting program at the Department  of Energy to advance a suite of energy storage technologies. It directs  DOE to establish a research and development program for cost-effective,  sustainable energy storage systems, including testing and validation  activities.  It directs the Department to develop a 5-year strategic plan to  continue to identify and refine research goals for the program, and it  would establish an energy storage demonstration program to help put  more energy storage systems on the electric grid.  Energy storage technologies take many forms, including batteries,  pumped hydropower, thermal energy storage, or chemical energy stored as  hydrogen. The development of cost-effective storage systems will help  reduce the intermittency issues of renewable generation sources like  solar and wind energy and will also help provide grid services, such as  frequency regulation to ensure the stability of the electrical supply  that consumers depend on. And they will begin to address the seasonal  variation, which is the final frontier of energy storage technology.  In my home district of Illinois, researchers at Argonne National Lab  are leading a national collaboration to accelerate the development of  advanced batteries, including novel cathode, anode, and electrolyte  designs, as well as new materials synthesis and characterization tools.  And that is why I am so pleased to see provisions of the BEST Act in  the Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act.  I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the hard work of my  colleague on the Science Committee, Mr. Casten, who introduced the  Promoting Grid Storage Act of 2019. His bill contained many important  provisions that have helped strengthen the version of the BEST Act that  we are considering within this package.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me and vote ``yes'' on  "", H.R. 4447, '.    "
