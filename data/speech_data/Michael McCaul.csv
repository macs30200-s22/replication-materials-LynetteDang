Michael McCaul,5.089701652526856,R," Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to also thank my good friend  from Texas for his service to the Nation.  The United States has a special partnership with Israel. In the past  4 years, we have strengthened this relationship while taking steps  toward peace in the Middle East under the Abraham Accords with Bahrain,  Sudan, and the UAE. This has made Israel and the entire Middle East  safer.  However, Israel still faces threats from malign actors like Iran that  seek to sow chaos and spread terror. In fact, earlier today, Iranian  President Rouhani directly threatened Israel by promising to support  Syria's aggression in the Golan Heights.  I am pleased the final bill bolsters cooperation between our  countries and fully funds the security assistance to Israel. It also  improves the laws on the books so that we can quickly supply Israel  with precision-guided missiles to defend themselves against malign  actors in the region.  This bill also enhances cooperation between our two nations by  establishing a defense acquisition advisory group.  As an NDAA conferee, I am proud this year's bill includes provisions  that support Israel and deepen our partnership.  Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would like to take a moment of  personal privilege to honor my colleague, my friend, my fellow Texan,  Congressman Mac Thornberry. His leadership on the House Armed Services  Committee has made our country stronger.  I am proud to have served with him in the Congress where we have  worked together on key national security issues, including the year's  NDAA which bears his name.  But most importantly, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to call him my friend.  He has brought dignity and bipartisanship to this Chamber.  For that, sir, we are forever grateful.    "
