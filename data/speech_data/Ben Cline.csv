Ben Cline,0.8596439957618713,R," Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Rockbridge  Christmas Baskets program.  Originally founded as the Santa Clause Truck, the Rockbridge  Christmas Baskets program has been a blessing to the Shenandoah Valley  since 1948.  This tremendous, all-volunteer organization assembles and delivers  thousands of food and toy care packages to struggling families each  year.  While the coronavirus may have put a damper on the holiday season for  some, it was no match for the generosity and spirit of the folks at the  Rockbridge Christmas Baskets program. Moving their packing day to a  larger facility and spreading it out over packing week to ensure the  health of those involved, the organization will donate a record 68,000  pounds of food and 1,300 toys to families throughout Lexington,  Rockbridge, and Buena Vista this year.  Having worked side by side with this incredible group many times,  along with my family, I can tell you it is the overwhelming community  effort that makes it such a success--plus the doughnut holes they  serve.  Folks coming together from all walks of life to help their neighbors  in need truly embodies the spirit of the holiday season, and I thank  the Rockbridge Christmas Baskets program for their continued efforts to  bring cheer to so many in our area.
