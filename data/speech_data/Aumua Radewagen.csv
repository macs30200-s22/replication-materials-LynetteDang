Aumua Radewagen,0.3286177217960357,R," Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Chabot for  yielding time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of ', H.R. 8229, ', the Parity for HUBZone  Appeals [[', Page , H6079, ] Act of 2020. I thank Ms. Houlahan for her collaboration on this  important legislation.  SBA's various small business contracting programs support different  types of entrepreneurs, from women and service-disabled veterans to  minorities and the economically disadvantaged, by providing these  businesses with special Federal contracting preferences.  Whether a business holds a specific status is critical in determining  whether that company is eligible to compete for these special contract  opportunities. Not only does the business have a vested interest in  obtaining and maintaining its status, but the Federal Government also  has an interest in making sure these special contracts are not awarded  to fraudulent firms. If a company is suspected to be ineligible for a  status it claims to hold, an interested party can protest the firm's  status.  Currently, for Historically Underutilized Business Zone-qualified, or  HUBZone-qualified, small businesses, the final arbiter of a firm's  special HUBZone status is the Associate Administrator of the Office of  Government Contracting and Business Development, or AA-GCBD. This  differs significantly from SBA's other Federal contracting programs in  which SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals, or OHA, is the final  decisionmaker of a firm's protested status.  OHA, unlike the AA-GCBD, is an independent office of the SBA. Leaving  the appeal decision to the AA-GCBD raises questions of conflict of  interest, whereas housing that process at OHA will ensure the decision  remains separate and independent from any influence.  Furthermore, the AA-GCBD has many competing priorities and  responsibilities in overseeing all the SBA's Federal contracting  programs. In contrast, OHA administrative judges are primarily tasked  with adjudicating similar types of appeals and, thus, are well trained  and well versed in making educated decisions objectively and  impartially. Thus, passage of this bill means that small businesses  will have a greater chance of having a fair and knowledgeable  assessment of their case.  Finally, the AA-GCBD's appeals decisions are currently made in a  vacuum. There is no visibility into the reasons why a decision was  reached. In contrast, all of OHA's decisions are published online and  easily searchable. These opinions are critical for small businesses to  obtain a greater understanding of the rules surrounding their  eligibility. Therefore, shifting the responsibility to hear HUBZone  appeals to OHA will provide the public with much-needed guidance and  transparency.  In sum, "", H.R. 8229, "" will bring greater parity, fairness, and  transparency between SBA's HUBZone program and its other Federal  contracting programs.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  legislation.    "
