Sean Maloney,1.9907691478729248,D," Mr. MALONEY. Thank you, sir. I yield back. [applause].  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Imagine. He had to tell his father: Do  not worry; I will be fine for telling the truth. It was his duty  because, in America, right matters.  President Trump has suggested that all of the witnesses are Never  Trumpers. That couldn't be further from the truth. As we just saw,  these U.S. officials are brave public servants. It is wrong--just flat  wrong--to suggest they were doing anything other than testifying out of  a sense of duty, as Lieutenant Colonel Vindman testified.  But it wasn't just U.S. officials whose reactions show us that this  was wrong; it is also clear how corrupt this scheme was because Ukraine  resisted it. President Zelensky was elected as a reformer. His first  few months in office lived up to this promise.  Here is Ambassador Taylor testifying on this point. Let's see it.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador TAYLOR. But once I arrived in Kyiv, I discovered   a weird combination of encouraging, confusing, and ultimately   alarming circumstances.  First, the encouraging. President Zelensky was reforming   Ukraine in a hurry. He appointed reformist ministers and   supported long-stalled anti-corruption legislation. He took   quick executive action, including opening Ukraine's High   Anti-Corruption Court. With a new parliamentary majority   stemming from snap elections, President Zelensky changed the   Ukraine Constitution to remove absolute immunity from Rada   deputies, the source of raw corruption for two decades. The   excitement in Kyiv was palpable. This time could be   different, a new Ukraine finally breaking from its corrupt,   post-Soviet past.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. So we know that President Zelensky was a  reformer, fighting corruption, fighting for reform, and he got started  early, as soon as he was sworn in. We know that President Zelensky's  agenda was in our U.S. national interest. In fact, every witness  testified that President Zelensky deserved America's support and that  they told President Trump that.  So keeping that in mind, it is extremely telling what President  Zelensky and his aides were saying behind closed doors. They were  concerned about being dragged into President Trump's scheme. They  recognized the political peril of going along with the President's  corrupt scheme. We know that was the case for many reasons, but let's  look at some of the evidence showing that now.  First, the Ukrainians made their concerns clear directly to U.S.  officials. On July 20, just days ahead of the July 25 call, Ambassador  Taylor spoke with President Zelensky's national security advisor. He  then conveyed to Ambassadors Sondland and Volker that the Ukrainian  leader ``did not want to be used as a pawn in a U.S. reelection  campaign.''  Here is Ambassador Taylor explaining what he understood that to mean.  Let's watch.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)    "
