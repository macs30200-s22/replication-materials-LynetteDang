Mike Crapo,0.265078991651535,R," Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator James Risch, Representative Mike Simpson, and Representative Russ Fulcher, I pay tribute to Idahoan Bill Lowry, who was deeply respected among his peers and beyond, having earned a wonderful reputation with hard work and integrity. His wisdom, good will, and stature helped inspire the development of the Owyhee Initiative, which we expect to help secure the future of ranching families and the culture of Owyhee County. The following is Bill's obituary honoring the life of this great American: ``William `Bill' Anson Lowry was born June 6, 1921 to Charles and Sally Lowry joining a sister, Hazel in Bend, Oregon. He was later joined by 3 brothers (Bob, Al, and Richard) and 7 more sisters (Effa, Gladys, Rhonda, Alta, Dorothy, Betty Jean, and Peggy). The family lived in Prineville, Oregon where Bill began school. They moved a couple times but landed back in Prineville where Bill graduated from the 8th grade. After his 8th grade graduation, he began working for the Stearns Cattle Company of Prineville. His Army discharge report listed his civilian occupation as `cowpuncher'. Bill always had a lot of respect for the Stearns family and they became his second family. It was there that he met the love of his life, Vernita `Nita' Hein, who was working in the cookhouse. In 1942 after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Bill was drafted into the United States Army. However, his induction was pushed back because of the flood of boys enlisting. Bill always wanted to honor the boys who quit school and rushed to enlist, describing many of them as being too young to shave. He related his experience and desire to honor these young men to Idaho State Representative Christy Zito at a meeting in Pleasant Valley. Christy then told his story to her friend, Brian Arnold, who composed a poem entitled Too Young to Shave. Through the good work of the Idaho Chapter of Dream Catchers, the poem is now engraved on a marble plaque and displayed in the Warhawk Museum in Nampa, Idaho, fulfilling his dream of honoring these young men. While on leave from his time in the Army Corps of Engineers, he married Nita on July 31, 1945. He was discharged in November of the same year and the young couple returned to Bill's job on the Stearns ranch. The couple began to save their money to realize their dream of owning their own ranch. They worked hard, lived simply, and saved every penny they could even with the addition of their sons, Tim and Mike. Eventually they were able to lease a couple of ranches, later purchasing a ranch in Pleasant Valley, Idaho in 1965. One of Bill's greatest joys in life was working on his ranch and with his Hereford cattle. His love (some would say obsession) for Hereford cattle came from his years of working for the Stearns and with their reputation commercial and registered Hereford cattle. His passions were family, Hereford cattle, thoroughbred saddle horses, conservative politics, education, and unwavering patriotism. Bill is survived by his sons and their families, Tim (Rosa Maria) and Mike (Gaylene); 10 siblings; 5 grandkids--Mirren Lowry, Amaya (Jim) O'Connor, Luke Lowry, Micki (Kevin) Golden, and Melissa (Cody) Bullock; and 9 great- grandchildren. He is preceded in death by his parents, Charles and Sally Lowry; oldest sister, Hazel; and wife, Nita. His family would like to express their deepest appreciation to the staff and residents of Grace Assisted Living in Nampa and the First Choice Hospice caregivers for their kindness to and care of Bill. He was grateful for all of you!'' The poem titled ``Too Young to Shave'' by Brian Arnold that was inspired by Bill and referenced in his obituary follows: ``His body was gnarled and twisted, like a wind-blown juniper tree He'd seen the sunrise and seen the sun set more times than two of me. Hobbling from his truck using two canes, so I stopped and held the door He said, `I'm here for the Town Hall meetin'. Is that what you're here for?' I wondered aloud why a ninety-year-old man even cared about civic affairs He said, `Let me tell you a story.' So I grabbed a couple of chairs. `When Pearl Harbor was bombed a bunch of us boys all went into town to join up From the farms and ranches, and some from in town, we had an enemy to whup. They took down our names and gave us a number, then said they'd give us a call So many young fellers were signing up that they couldn't process them all. Was a whole lot of youngsters standin in line, see they was lyin about their age All ready to die for our country, while still too young to shave. It took a few months before they got to us all, `cause so many wanted to go I was an infantryman in the Army, a regular G.I. Joe. Saw many a good man die over there, it was a special kind of hell We were all just tryin to do our part, for some it didn't work out well. Most are buried in those foreign lands, they never did come home They gave their all for freedom, across the briny foam. That war's long over and there's been some since, but I can never forget True comrades that I fought alongside, as they placed their final bet. So that's why I'm here, just to make sure, that as long as our proud flag waves I do my damndest to honor, those men too young to shave.' '' Bill was a blessing to his family and the community in which he lived, and he will be long-remembered with great affection and respect. We are all saddened by Bill's passing yet grateful for his life and legacy.<bullet> [[<a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7154"">Page S7154</a>]]   "
