Frank Lucas,0.5105558037757874,R," Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. It is an  honor to be here. Discussing my Agriculture Committee chairman and my  colleague for 2\\1/2\\ years, Bob Smith, is truly an honor.  When I was sworn in, in a special election and I first surveyed this  body, one of the faces I recognized was this huge figure of a man  standing at the back brass rail. I can still almost see [["", Page , H6054, ] Bob right over there surveying the House floor and watching the  process.  Bob was one of those folks who had a quiet, calm demeanor. He was a  wonderful mentor to me in that first 6 months, then he went home to the  ranch for 2 years, and then we begged him to come back and lead the  Agriculture Committee for the next 2 years.  Bob was a wonderful mentor to me. He was a wonderful mentor to the  underclassmen. The first times that I went with the committee on trips  to understand agriculture around the world was with Bob, and he had a  diplomat's style and skill. He was firm. As Congressman Walden  remembered, he wouldn't take anything from anyone. He had a way about  him. He gained your trust and he gained your confidence.  It is hard to believe that he is not with us anymore. But Bob was one  of those folks whose personality, his heart, and his intellect were  just as big and broad as those shoulders were. I consider myself  fortunate for having served with him. I know the family will miss him  with intensity forever. But, Mr. Speaker, 89 years is a good, long  life. I can promise you in the time I served with him here, he lived it  to the fullest.  {time} 1045    "
