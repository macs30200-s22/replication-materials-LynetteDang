Chris Stewart,0.7620748281478882,R," Mr. STEWART. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I rise in support of this bill to rename the new Federal courthouse  in Utah after my good friend, Senator Orrin G. Hatch. He is my friend.  He was, in many ways, my mentor. He has been a friend of my family.  At the risk of repeating some information that has already been said,  I think it is worth just highlighting some of his really incredible and  notable achievements. [["", Page , H6988, ]  In the first place, just serving his Nation for 42 years in the U.S.  Senate; again, the longest-serving Republican Senator in all of U.S.  history. He rose to the position of President pro tempore, serving  under seven Presidents and nine Senate majority leaders.  I love this fact; it is remarkable: He has passed more legislation  than any other Senator who is alive today, more than 750 bills, which I  think reflects on not only his long career, but on his ability to work  with others because he could not have done that by himself. He could  not have done that just with his own party. He had to do that in a  bicameral and a bipartisan fashion, and he certainly did, and he is  known for that.  Again, the numerous leadership positions, chairman of three major  committees, which have already been mentioned here.  I think it is fair, as well, and appropriate that we mention not only  him, but his wife, Elaine. As good as Orrin is, Elaine is every bit as  good and in some cases better. And their 6 children and 23  grandchildren, the result of 60 years of marriage.  Of final note, Senator Hatch was particularly active and impactful in  the judiciary. I think that every sitting U.S. District Court Judge in  Utah, including, by the way, my brother, owes, to some degree, their  position because of the support of Senator Hatch. He had an  unparalleled career. He had an unparalleled impact on the judiciary,  and it is perfectly appropriate that we name the new courthouse in Salt  Lake City after this distinguished gentleman, and I absolutely support  and endorse this effort.
