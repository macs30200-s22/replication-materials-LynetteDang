Joaquin Castro,1.187753438949585,D," Mr. CASTRO. Mr. Speaker, this month, the American people were  unwillingly taken to the brink of war at the reckless direction of this  administration. As a coequal branch of government, we must ensure that  no President can take any military action without coming to Congress  first.  Repealing the 2002 AUMF and passing the No War Against Iran Act will  prevent any future escalation or military action without the full  consideration and consent of this body. At the same time, they preserve  the military's ability to take actions in self-defense to protect our  forces.  The American people are tired of unnecessary wars that leave our  country less safe. It is our responsibility as elected Representatives  to prevent our Nation from entering an unnecessary war with Iran. These  measures are critical in that respect.  We cannot allow recklessness to lead us into a protracted conflict  that is not in our interests and will lead to suffering.    "
