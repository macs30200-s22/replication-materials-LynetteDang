Warren Davidson,0.1093414947390556,R," Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank this body for the opportunity to recognize our alma mater and our  Association of Graduates at the United States Military Academy at West  Point.  As Mr. Shimkus was highlighting, I didn't come the easy way. As a  friend of mine likes to say, sometimes God will bring you the easiest  way you will go.  For me, my journey to West Point started in my high school guidance  counselor's classroom in September of senior year. Most people realize  that is kind of a late start for the path that it takes to go to one of  our Nation's service academies.  And then she asked me what I wanted to do, And I said: Well, I want  to be an Army ranger.  She said: Well, you know, you are pretty smart. You should go to  college. You should consider college, at least.  I said: Well, you know, I thought about going to West Point. Then I  could be in the Army and go to college.  She looked at me like she felt sorry for me. She said: Well, baby,  that is not going to happen.  That wasn't mean; it was realistic. I had not done the work that it  would take to get there.  She walked me through who normally gets in: The salutatorians, the  valedictorians, the people with the high GPAs while being captain of  sports, Eagle Scouts, and what not. I recognized some of my classmates  who had been on that path, and I recognized that that is not the path  that I had been on. No one in my family on my dad's side had gone to  college.  So she told me: You should work on some other plans.  So I did them. I enlisted in the Army. And when I got to the Army,  thankfully, some of Brett Guthrie's classmates, 1987 graduates Larry  Bradley and Terry Finley, were platoon leaders.  Larry Bradley ended up being my platoon leader for a composite  platoon that got training by the 10th Special Forces Group down in Bad  Tolz, Germany. And it was there, during that platoon, that I learned  that the Berlin Wall had come down, that it wasn't part of the  training, it wasn't just a jazzy intro to a speech.  Some noncommissioned officers stepped up and said: Write this day  down. It is going to be one of the most famous days in history, 9  November 1989.  We thought: Bold intro.  But from that, I had a chance to do something unbelievable that was  the culmination not just of graduates of the United States Military  Academy, but the culmination of people who had fought to win that war.  So many of them West Point graduates, like Eisenhower, like Bradley,  like Patton, who helped liberate a people in that continent.  But I got to see the culmination of that as the wall came down not  because Mr. Gorbachev tore it down or Mr. Reagan tore it down, but  because the East German people found out what was on the other side of  it, and they tore their own wall down. And they found out that the  fruits of our ideology had produced shockingly different results than  what their ideology had produced.  {time} 2000  It is shocking today to think that we might relive some of those bad  choices that led to poverty and scarcity on the other side of the wall  while our ideas led to abundance and flourishing, not perfectly, but  far superior.  From there, I went to the prep school, and I met classmates like  Ranger Bill Lynn. His first unit deployment led him to jump into  Panama, and he had a combat jump there. I met classmates at the prep  school who didn't make it to West Point. Indeed, one of my 1995  classmates is currently the commandant of the United States Military  Academy Preparatory School.  It is a great path, but I also met people who had not been in the  Army. I met people who had come there to increase the diversity  objectives of the Military Academy, who needed a little more strength  on their academics or maybe who needed to balance the academics with  the athletics that they were going to be able to participate in. That  was about half the class.  I learned about a special club at West Point shortly after I came  called the Two-Percent Club, and I met my wife. The Two-Percent Club,  for those who don't know, are those who start with a girlfriend and  graduate with the same girlfriend and end up marrying that girl. I am  thankful today that I am married to my Lisa. People would talk about  Lisa this, and Lisa that, but I would always refer to my Lisa, the girl  who chose to marry me.  We experienced cadet life in a different way. We have all these  memories of things like the cadet in the red sash stepping up to the  line, but not on the line or over the line. We remember things like  Beast Barracks in Buckner, Boodlers runs, spinning the spurs. We  remember the honor code and the character that was so prominently  featured there, that, ``A cadet will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor  tolerate those who do.''  We remember how hard it was to live with the consequences for people  who made those bad decisions, who you knew to be good people, who came  to be separated because it was taken very seriously there.  We saw in the cadet parades that we talked about on the parade fields  The Long Gray Line for the ceremonies where they would lay a wreath for  Founders Day at the statue of Colonel Sylvanus Thayer. You would see  men and women in uniform, but you would see senior citizens at the  front of the line.  The oldest graduate would lay the wreath--often in a wheelchair,  feebly mustering every ounce of strength necessary sometimes to move  from that chair to lay that wreath with pride at the statue in front of  the sup's house.  We remember the million-dollar view at Trophy Point, and we remember  the quarter-million-dollar education one nickel at a time as we  studied.  We remember friends and classmates who helped us through the hard  times. We remember the knowledge like duty, honor, country, or  Schofield's Definition of Discipline.  We remember the seriousness with which nearly every one of us took  the opportunity to be prepared, should the case arise that we would  lead our Nation's young men and women in combat, that we would be ready  to face the challenge. Many of my classmates did that.  I served 5 years in great units, the Old Guard, the 101st Airborne  Division, and the 75th Ranger Regiment. I left Active Duty, which  shocked many of my classmates, and I found a great sense of purpose,  that to give a lifetime of service to the Nation didn't always mean in  uniform. But you still look in awe at the sacrifice that so many have  made who continued on in Active Duty, especially those who gave the  last full measure to keep our Nation free and to bring honor to The  Long Gray Line.  Today, as I look at young men and women and have the privilege of  calling them and congratulating them on all of the work that it takes  to do it--generally, the right way--the advanced [["", Page , H2634, ] knowledge and the preparation--the more common way--the disciplined  path that started earlier in life, I am encouraged because there are so  many talented young men and women who still want to put on our Nation's  uniform to make sure that our Nation is made and kept free with an all- volunteer force committed to serve our country.  I look at The Long Gray Line today, a line that is a very tight-knit  alumni organization where friends could be distant for years, even  decades, and, in a moment, connect as if you just finished playing  spades with one another after hours, ditching the late-lights  penalties.  I look forward to those times. I cherish those memories. And I am so  thankful to the West Point Association of Graduates, which has set a  great example of how to bond classmates together to serve the cause and  interest of our great alma mater so that this Long Gray Line may  continue to flourish always.
