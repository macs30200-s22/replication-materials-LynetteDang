Marc Veasey,0.6577884554862976,D," Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to pass  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act.  Because we are in the middle of a global pandemic that has killed  almost 130,000 Americans and is ravaging my home State of Texas and has  left our hospitals overwhelmed right now, it is now more important that  we do everything that we can to strengthen the ACA. This important  legislation has already given access to millions of people that now  have lifesaving healthcare, many who could not previously access it.  Madam Speaker, this legislation that I am working on now pushes  critical provisions, like lowering healthcare costs, strengthening  protections for people with preexisting conditions, negotiating for  lower prescription drug prices, and expanding healthcare by pressing  for Medicaid expansion.  Madam Speaker, let me tell you something: You don't want to get sick  in Texas right now. You don't want to get sick in Texas right now. Our  hospitals are overwhelmed because of the inaction of our Governor. It  is shameful.  Anything that we can do here to help the crisis that we have back in  our State, which is also about to grip other States in this Nation, we  need to act on it now.  Time cannot wait.    "
