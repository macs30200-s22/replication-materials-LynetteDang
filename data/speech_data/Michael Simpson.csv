Michael Simpson,0.0596408136188983,R," Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the fiscal year  2021 omnibus appropriations bill, and particularly the Energy and Water  Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.  As ranking member of the subcommittee, I am pleased this bill is  significantly improved from the House bill in many ways.  First and foremost, the bill strongly supports our national nuclear  security programs, providing $15.3 billion for the Weapons Activities  account, an increase of $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2020. This  funding supports the maintenance and modernization of our nuclear  weapons system, which will ensure a credible and reliable nuclear  deterrent.  One of my personal priorities is promoting innovation and growth in  nuclear energy. This bill provides almost $1.4 billion for research,  development, and demonstration activities, including increased funding  for the Advanced Small Modular Reactors Program and the Advanced  Reactors Demonstration Program, both programs focused on building the  next generation of carbon-free technologies to be deployed here and  abroad.  The bill also includes critical water storage projects in the  drought-prone West, such as the Anderson Ranch Dam raise in my district  in Idaho.  Mr. Speaker, before I yield back, I would like to thank the full  committee ranking member, Kay Granger, who has so ably led our  Republican Conference on appropriations matters all Congress long. And  full committee Chairwoman Lowey deserves our thanks for her many years  of service in this committee and to the Nation. We will miss her.  Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Chairwoman Marcy  Kaptur and I, again, worked well with our Senate partners, Lamar  Alexander and Dianne Feinstein, to advance national and constituent  interests throughout the programs that are funded in this bill.  Finally, I would like to thank staff on both sides of the aisle for  their hard work--extremely hard work--particularly this last month,  working to help bring this bill to completion.  Mr. Speaker, this appropriations package, which includes the Energy  and Water division, is a strong bill, and I urge my colleagues to  support it.    "
