Daniel Kildee,0.3398707807064056,D," Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.  This is a moment we can all come together, Democrats and Republicans,  including the President of the United States, and do something big and  bold that would help American families get through this most difficult  time.  Madam Speaker, I commend the chairman for his work in moving quickly  and putting this legislation together. I commend those on the other  side who will stand with us today and support this.  It is my hope that this legislation will quickly go over to the  Senate. They will get the message and send this legislation on to the  President, wherever he may be. He will sign the bill, and we can get  this help to the American people.  {time} 1615    "
