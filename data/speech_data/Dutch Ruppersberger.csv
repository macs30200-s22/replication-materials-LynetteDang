Dutch Ruppersberger,0.5204959511756897,D," Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of ', H.R. 1966, "", and I  thank the gentleman for yielding.  I proudly co-led this bill when it was first introduced by our late  friend, Elijah Cummings, in honor of the extraordinary life and legacy  of a Baltimore native, Henrietta Lacks.  Although Congressman Cummings has passed on and remains deeply  missed, I am proud and grateful that Congressman Mfume has picked up  the mantle on this important legislation.  Without her knowledge or permission, doctors used Henrietta Lacks'  cells for medical research that eventually led to some of medicine's  most critical breakthroughs, including development of the polio  vaccine, along with treatments for cancer, HIV/AIDS, leukemia, and  Parkinson's.  I can think of only a handful of Marylanders or even Americans who  have contributed more to modern medicine than Henrietta Lacks. Her  lifesaving contributions will continue to advance cures for  debilitating diseases for generations to come.  Yet more than 70 years after Henrietta Lacks' death, many communities  still face glaring health disparities. For example, while cancer  incidence rates are highest among non-Hispanic White females, non- Hispanic Black females have the highest rate of death.  Clinical trials are a key component to advancing cancer research and  treatment, but 20 percent of cancer clinical trials fail because of a  lack of patient enrollment, with racial and ethnic minorities and  older, rural, and lower-income Americans generally underrepresented in  such trials.  This bill examines access to government-funded cancer clinical trials  for traditionally underrepresented groups, but it is also about much  more.  It is about giving credit where credit has been long overdue, it is  about ensuring all Americans get the medical treatments they deserve,  and it is about ensuring clinical trials succeed because they are  inclusive.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.    "
