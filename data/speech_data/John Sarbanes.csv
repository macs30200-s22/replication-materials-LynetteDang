John Sarbanes,1.3064370155334473,D," Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader for yielding.  I thank you for your friendship with my father, Paul Sarbanes, for so  many years. You go back with him a long way, and he cherished that  friendship, as he did the relationship with all the members of the  Maryland Delegation during the time that he served.  I thank my colleagues here tonight who have come to help remember him  and pay tribute.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my brother, Michael, and my sister, Janet,  I thank [["", Page , H7028, ] all the people who, over the last 48 hours, have been sending in these  remembrances and tributes to my father from his time in the Senate, and  before that, here in the House where he was for 6 years, and for time  periods before that, even.  I want to thank right up front, and in particular, his staff, who  over the course of his 40 years in public service he understood were  the ones that made him or broke him. He was a tough taskmaster, but he  chose people that had that same set of principles and values and  commitment to hard work. A lot of the tributes that have been coming in  have talked about him being a workhorse, not a show horse. The idea  that you put your head down, you get the job done, you try to build  consensus where you can, but you always remember that you are here for  a reason, that is to make good, strong policy that can help people.  He lived a full life, he made a difference in the lives of others,  which is all he ever wanted to do. He knew he wanted to be in politics  from a very early age, but his motivation was in looking at the  opportunities that he had, the son of Greek immigrants who came to this  country with very little, and he had the opportunity for education and  advancement. His motivation was to make those available to others.  He loved being with people. He had a dry sense of humor. He enjoyed  bantering with all who crossed his path, was intensely interested in  the journey that others had taken to whatever station they held in  life. And he was always asking: ``Where are you from?'' ``What do you  do?'' ``What is next for you?''  He had an inherent integrity that was strengthened by always striving  to meet the expectations of those who put their confidence in him.  In politics, he was motivated, as I said, by the burning conviction  that every individual has dignity and the potential to succeed if given  a fair shot, and he was determined others would have those same  opportunities that he had enjoyed.  {time} 1930  He understood that if you share the credit, if you don't seek credit,  you get a lot more done. That was how he operated.  A few years ago, I prevailed upon him to sit for about 20 hours of  videotaped oral history because I wanted to make sure we captured the  essence of his life and his career. So, we have this treasure, which we  will make available to people as we move forward. I wanted, in his own  words, to grab a few excerpts from that, that I think convey who he is  and what he cared about.  I remember I came home one time, and he was sitting in the living  room on the couch, and he was revved up about something. I don't know  what the issue was that day that had gotten him sort of motivated. But  he banged on the side of the couch, and he said: ``I am for the little  guy. I am for the little guy.'' He might as well, in that moment, have  been stating his purpose in public life. That is what motivated him  from the moment he got up in the morning until the moment he went to  bed at night.  I am going to read a couple of these things from his oral history. He  talked about getting public housing, senior citizen affordable housing,  in the Inner Harbor in Baltimore. He was very proud of the fact that  you had this senior citizen housing there.  He said: ``Next door to it is an expensive hotel, and behind the  hotel is a big condominium building with very expensive condominiums in  it. Every time I go by that building, I get a sense of satisfaction out  of it, particularly in the nice weather. I look up, and all of these  seniors are sitting out on their terraces, looking out over the water.  ``I know the developers would give their eyeteeth to get ahold of  that piece of property, but they don't have it. It is part of this  affordable housing initiative, so a lot of seniors who worked hard all  their lives and are now retired but don't have a lot of money have the  benefit of this housing.''  He said: ``I always get a measure of satisfaction out of that.''  We are in the midst, as we know, in our country of some really  challenging moments addressing issues of justice. Here is a story about  how my father, in a small way, made a statement around justice.  He said: ``We had a situation in one of the rural towns on the  Eastern Shore, and when they delivered the mail, the postman, he would  come down the street here, and there would be these big houses, and he  would go up to the house and put the mail in the mailbox. And then as  he moved on down the street, the composition of the neighborhood would  change, and the houses would get smaller, much smaller.  ``The complexion of the people living in the houses changed, too, as  you went down the street, so they went from White to Black. And down  the street, instead of the postman going through the gate or whatever  and up to the house, they were going to require those people to put a  postbox at the street. So, some people came to us about that, a couple  of pastors or ministers, and they pointed out this situation.  ``So, I got the postal people in for a meeting in my office,'' my  father said. ``'Now, what is happening here? As I understand it, up  here with the big houses and the White residents, you are going to  continue to go up to the house and put the mail through the door slot.  But when you get down this way to the little houses and the African- American residents, you are going to require them to put a mail  receptacle out at the pavement or at the curb, and you are not going to  go up to the house anymore. What is the rationale for this policy?'  ``Well, of course, if you lay it out like that, there isn't a  rationale, at least not an acceptable one that can withstand the light  of day. So, they dropped the project and went on delivering the mail.''  Here is what my father said: ``That is the way it ought to work. And  I felt it is not a big issue, but we got some justice done for those  people.''  Small things that stand for big principles, that is what he was  about.  I am going to close with just a couple of final thoughts here. First  of all, I want to thank the Greek-American community, which was  fiercely proud of my father's achievements. He was deeply proud of  where he came from. It was an inspiration to him in public service. I  want to thank so many who helped him along the way from that community.  My mother, Christine, who died 10 years ago, she came into his life  like a bolt of lightning. He didn't know what hit him. He met her at  Oxford, this brilliant, beautiful woman who could match him step for  step in her intellect, and she knocked his socks off.  I think the great regret of his life was that he had hoped in his  retirement--you know, public life is hard. We know that. I think all  along the way, he was looking forward to that time when the two of them  could spend more time together. Unfortunately, she passed away within a  couple of years of his retirement, and they didn't get that opportunity  together. I don't think he ever fully recovered from that.  I think about his legacy, and I understand, certainly, that there is  no way his children--myself; my brother, Michael; and my sister,  Janet--are ever going to match that legacy because it is a pretty  unmatchable one when you look at the record. But I think we are all  doing what we can to continue it, to nurture it, to sustain it going  forward.  Again, I thank you for the time to speak here, and I thank my  colleagues for all of your support and kind words over the last couple  of days.    "
