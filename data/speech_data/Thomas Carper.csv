Thomas Carper,0.6317200064659119,D," Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want to share with the Senate my reasons  for opposing the nomination of Aurelia Skipwith to serve as the  Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Let me begin by saying that I am disappointed to find myself in this  position. When I had the privilege of serving as Governor of Delaware,  I was able to assemble my own leadership team, so I appreciate how  important it is that people in executive positions, including  Presidents, have that same ability.  However, in article II of the Constitution, our Founders set up a  system in which the President would nominate individuals to the top  posts in our government and Senators would provide ``advice and  consent'' on those nominees.  In order for the Senate to fulfill that constitutional role, those  nominated individuals must cooperate with the confirmation process.  And, unfortunately, Ms. Skipwith has not provided information requested  by the Democrats during the nomination process.  Despite my repeated requests for the nominee to be more forthcoming-- requests made twice in writing and twice in person. during her  nomination process--Ms. Skipwith has refused. Instead, she has given me  the impression that she does not take this confirmation process  seriously.  Her lack of candor has elevated questions that already existed about  her qualifications, her commitment to environmental conservation and  whether she can ethically lead the Fish and Wildlife Service.  Therefore, I cannot support this nomination.  Ms. Skipwith first joined the Trump administration in April 2017.  when she was appointed as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Fish and  Wildlife and Parks, a non-Senate-confirmed political appointment at the  Department of the Interior.  During her tenure there, the Fish and Wildlife Service proposed and  finalized controversial regulations that drastically altered  implementation of the Endangered Species Act.  The Service has also issued a legal opinion that changes the way the  Department of the Interior enforces the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.  Former senior Interior officials from every administration since the  early 1970s, both Republican and Democrat, have strongly opposed this  Migratory Bird Treaty Act legal opinion. At her confirmation hearing,  Ms. Skipwith vehemently defended it.  Prior to her controversial tenure at the Interior Department, Ms.  Skipwith had no previous work experience related to conservation or  wildlife management--none.  By contrast, the 16 individuals who previously served as Fish and  Wildlife Service Directors for both Republican and Democratic  Presidents had an estimated average of 12 years of experience at the  Fish and Wildlife Service before taking on the Director role. They also  have an estimated average of more than 22 years of professional  experience in fields related to wildlife or fisheries management.  Ms. Skipwith has also not seemed to make up for her lack of previous  experience while on the job. At her confirmation hearing, when asked to  name the conservation scientist who had most influenced her career and  her approach to wildlife and fisheries management, Ms. Skipwith  struggled to name any conservation scientist. Ultimately, she named a  former Monsanto vice president with whom she used to work, but she  misremembered his name.  This was not an insignificant misstep. To me, it was revealing. Ms.  Skipwith's response to my simple question represented a clear lack of  familiarity with the basics of wildlife management, a troubling quality  for a Fish and Wildlife Director nominee.  By contrast, Ms. Skipwith does have significant experience in the  agribusiness industry. Before joining the Trump administration, she  worked for Monsanto, one of the world's largest agrochemical firms.  Monsanto regularly has business interests before the Interior  Department. She also worked for Alltech, a Kentucky-based agricultural  products company.  She also co-founded AVC Global, an agribusiness-technology start up,  and was employed by Gage International, a Washington, DC, based  lobbying firm founded by her fiance.  That is why even before her confirmation hearing, I asked Ms.  Skipwith some basic questions about how these companies operate and [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7009"">Page S7009</a>, ] whether Ms. Skipwith has recused herself from working on those issues.  Unfortunately, Ms. Skipwith has refused to answer those questions.  She has repeatedly refused to provide her calendars with the  appointments she has had as a Department of the Interior official. This  information could be made available to any member of the public under  the Freedom of Information Act, but she has refused to provide it to me  for months within the confirmation process.  This information is important because Ms. Skipwith's former employer,  Gage International, has represented water utilities that have lobbied  Congress to weaken Western water policy and the Endangered Species Act.  Unanswered questions also remain about Ms. Skipwith's role in the  development of a controversial repeal of an existing ban on using  pesticides that have been shown to harm birds and bees in national  wildlife refuges. And one of the largest producers of these pesticides  is Monsanto, another one of Ms. Skipwith's former employers.  Yet when Senator Gillibrand asked Ms. Skipwith about her role in the  ban's repeal, Ms. Skipwith defended the reversal but denied any role in  the decision. This answer does not appear to be consistent with some of  the email records that have been obtained under Freedom of Information  Act, which show that she expressed interest in the matter and received  materials on the issue from career staff.  If Ms. Skipwith was indeed involved with the decision to reverse the  pesticides ban, it would constitute a violation of the ethics pledge  she signed when she joined the Department. An examination of Ms.  Skipwith's calendar entries could clear up these outstanding questions,  but her lack of cooperation makes that impossible.  This lack of being forthcoming is troubling, not only because it  undermines the Senate's advice and consent role for Presidential  nominees, but it also because it demonstrates the nominee's may not be  cooperative when it comes to congressional oversight.  I have found that, when a nominee is unwilling to provide information  as part of their confirmation process, they almost always prove to be  even more defiant to congressional oversight requests after they are  confirmed.  I urge my colleagues. especially my Republican colleagues, to take  this matter seriously. In fact, I would urge my Republican colleagues  to remember these words spoken by my friend, former Congressman Trey  Gowdy of South Carolina.  In June 2012, during the House Oversight and Government Reform  Committee contempt proceedings against Attorney General Holder, then  Congressman Gowdy said: ``The notion that you can withhold information  and documents from Congress no matter whether you are the party in  power or not in power is wrong. Respect for the rule of law must mean  something, irrespective of the vicissitudes of political cycles.''  Eventually, whether it is in 1 year or in 4 years or in 8, we will  eventually have another Democratic administration. And when that time  comes, Republicans in Congress will want officials in that Democratic  administration to answer questions and respond to congressional  oversight requests.  I fear that my Senate colleagues will find the process completely  broken by then if we continue undermining our duty as Senators to both  provide advice and consent on Presidential nomination and to conduct  congressional oversight.  This clear defiance of our sworn constitutional duty and  congressional oversight role diminishes the Senate, weakens our  intricate system of checks and balances, and undermines the trust of  the American people.  Beyond her lack of qualifications and her questionable role in some  of this administration's major conservation policies, there are too  many troubling concerns and questions about this nominee that remain  unaddressed or unanswered.  Therefore, I will be opposing this nomination, and I encourage my  colleagues to do the same.    "
