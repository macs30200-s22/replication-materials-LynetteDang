Stacey Plaskett,0.3708006739616394,D," Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues, and while I am  happy to support measures to improve resiliency in the Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure, a committee on which I serve, I am  disappointed that this bill is not inclusive of U.S. territories other  than Puerto Rico in the normal operation of this new resiliency  program.  Under the Stafford Act, the Virgin Islands and all other U.S.  territories and the District of Columbia are defined and treated as  States. This legislative amendment to the Stafford Act should be no  different. That is why the House version of this bill was amended in  committee, so that this new program is equally inclusive of all  jurisdictions that are already treated as States by the Stafford Act.  That was not what was approved by the committee but passed by this  House in ', H.R. 2, ', the Moving Forward Act.  Madam Speaker, the Virgin Islands and the other smaller territories  have been devastated by unprecedented natural disasters in recent  years. All of these American jurisdictions have tremendous need for  hazard mitigation projects that reduce risks for homeowners,  businesses, nonprofits, the cost of insurance claims, and Federal  relief payments from extreme weather-related disasters.  I believe it is unfair to have a program that first makes grants to  Indian Tribes, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia to improve  resiliency, and then tells the four remaining smaller jurisdictions,  defined as States already, that they get to have what amounts to  pennies maybe left over from the 2 percent set aside of funding that  first is going to be spent on administrative costs and technical  assistance to give the resiliency program to everyone else.  Madam Speaker, as a practical matter, of course, that will amount to  nothing left for the people of my district, American Samoa, Guam, the  Northern Marianas, and the smaller territories.  Madam Speaker, I understand and have been told that the committee is  willing to work and try to find a technical fix to this both in the  House and the Senate. I urge that that occurs. While I support this  measure, once again, you cannot continue to forget the smaller  territories. [[', Page , H7268, ]    Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.  Madam Speaker, I do say, first off, I truly appreciate the words and  the passion from my good friend from the U.S. Virgin Islands (Ms.  Plaskett). I am disappointed to see that this bill came back from the  Senate without the provisions that we supported on her behalf in the  committee.  Madam Speaker, I, too, would like to echo to the Senate and to the  House as we move into the future: Let's address this concern. There is  bipartisan support for what Ms. Plaskett is asking for.  These are the types of bipartisan issues that we usually try and  solve in the House, but, unfortunately, we got this from the Senate. We  will let them be the ones to admit they screwed this up with a  technical error.  But let's fix it. That is the key. Let's work together to make that  happen.  Madam Speaker, in closing, "", S. 3418, "" will help support critical  mitigation projects in local communities, including rural communities  that are hit and devastated by these natural disasters. This will save  lives and prevent damage and loss to farmers, businesses, and  homeowners across the country, and it is also going to save, long term,  billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars that are going, time and  time again, to help communities recover from events we know are going  to happen.  Let's do something on the front end and save taxpayer dollars for the  next generation on the back end.  Madam Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn't thank the staff on both  sides of the aisle for their work to get this bill to a good place and  with the Senate: on the majority side, Aaron Davis; on our own side,  Johanna Hardy; and in my office, Jimmy Ballard. I really appreciate all  these folks and what they have done to help districts like mine.  I also thank some folks who really worked hard on this bill, too,  that are with me here today from the committee: Corey Cooke and her  number one fan, her puppy, Coda Cooke; and also Tara Hupman and her  number one fan, her puppy, Chester Hupman. I certainly hope my number  one fans, when I get home, Rider and Julia Davis, one day get a chance  to meet theirs.  But it takes people working together to get things done, and these  are the types of issues that show our success in this institution.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
