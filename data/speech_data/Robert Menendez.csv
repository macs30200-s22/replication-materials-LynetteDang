Robert Menendez,1.1897350549697876,D," Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, we have just passed the Armenian  genocide resolution recognition. It is fitting and appropriate that the  Senate stands on the right side of history in doing so. It commemorates  the truth of the Armenian genocide.  On Monday, we commemorated the International Day of Commemoration and  Dignity of the victims of the crime of genocide and of the prevention  of this crime. The UN General Assembly established this day of  remembrance to commemorate and honor the victims of genocide and  highlight efforts to combat and prevent genocide. Passing this  resolution is a fitting tribute to this day of remembrance.  I have come to the floor on various occasions to talk about the  history of the Armenian genocide. An Armenian priest, Krikoris  Balakian, recorded some of the massacres against the Armenians. He  said:  In Ankara and its surroundings, only a couple hundred miles   east of Constantinople, the killing was done with ``axes,   cleavers, shovels, and pitchforks.'' It was like a   slaughterhouse; Armenians were hacked to pieces . . . infants   were dashed on rocks before the eyes of their mothers.  It was indescribable horror. Even when Armenians were supposedly  deported, the conditions they were forced to live in made clear that  Turkey's ultimate goal was to eliminate the Armenian people.  A visitor to one Turkish city in October of 1915 wrote: ``The 16,000  deported Armenians who were living in the tents have been sent to Konia  in cattle trucks. At night, while thousands of these unfortunate  people, without food or shelter, shiver with cold, those brutes who are  supposed to be their guardians attack them with clubs. And push them  towards the station. Women, children, and old men are packed together  in the trucks. The men have to climb on to the top of the trucks, in  spite of the dreadful cold. Their cries are heart-breaking, but all is  in vain. Hunger, cold, and fatigue, together with the Government's  deeds of violence, will soon achieve the extermination of the last  remnant of the Armenian people.''  Henry Morgenthau, the U.S. Ambassador for Turkey, from 1913 to 1916,  understood full well what was transpiring. He left his post in early  1916 because, as he later recalled, ``My failure to stop the  destruction of the Armenians had made Turkey for me a place of  horror.''  American diplomats like Henry Morgenthau were on the ground in  Turkey, and they made heroic efforts to help the Armenian people, but  here in Washington at the time, no one did anything in the face of this  heinous crime.  As former UN Ambassador Samantha Power wrote in her Pulitzer Prize- winning book, ``A Problem from Hell,'' ``America's nonresponse to the  Turkish horrors established patterns that would be repeated.''  As my colleague from Texas, my cosponsor who has been such a stalwart  advocate with me, has very often noted, this is the first genocide to  be recorded in this century. We know all too well the horrors in the  20th century with the Holocaust and other genocides around the world.  So here in the Senate today, we break those patterns. We join the House  and voted to do so by passing a resolution affirming the facts of the  genocide, 405 to 11. Today, the Senate shows the same resolve.  I am deeply grateful to Senator Cruz for his stalwart leadership on  this issue and to the 27 other Senators from both parties who have  cosponsored the resolution and demonstrated their commitment to the  truth, and the truth finally will set us free.  I am thankful that this resolution has passed in a time in which  there are still survivors of the genocide. We will be able to see that  the Senate acknowledges what they left.  Madam President, I yield the floor.    "
