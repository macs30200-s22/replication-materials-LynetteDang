Bill Flores,0.3863523602485657,R," Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th birthday of Edythe  Kengla Swann.  Edythe was born on December 5, 1920, in Tucson, Arizona, to Herman  Kengla and Joaquina Robles Kengla. She is a descendant of Arizona's  pioneering ranching and railroad families.  Since childhood, Edythe was instilled with a pioneering spirit. Her  grandfather, Bernabe Robles, was an immigrant from Mexico who  established a stagecoach shop in Arizona that ultimately became the  Robles Ranch in the mid-1880s. The ranching complex ultimately  comprised over one million acres, making it one of the largest ranches  in Arizona.  Edythe graduated from the University of Arizona in 1941 with a degree  in home economics. As the United States entered World War II, more  women were being called upon to fill jobs that were previously held by  men. Edythe was determined to take advantage of the new opportunities  opening around her. Enamored by the possibility of travel, Edythe  became a flight attendant for American Airlines.  Flight attendant school was an immersive environment of rigorous  training in a multitude of subjects. Edythe became well-versed in the  technical side of flying. She excelled in meteorology and was well- prepared for difficult emergencies during flight. Edythe also took  great interest in the maintenance of the DC-3 aircraft and was very  knowledgeable about the inner workings of many cockpit systems.  Edythe diligently worked to meet industry expectations and create an  atmosphere that eased the concerns of her passengers while promoting  the airline industry. She loved being a pioneer in a profession that  represented new opportunities to women and allowed them to find freedom  through adventure.  While Edythe was stationed with American Airlines in El Paso, she met  Richard Earnest Swann, a lieutenant in the Army stationed at Fort  Bliss. Edythe and Richard quickly fell in love and were married in  1945. At the time, airlines required that flight attendants be  unmarried, so Edythe made the difficult choice to leave behind her  beloved career for her new future as a wife and a mother.  Together, Edythe and Richard raised five children and started their  own business, representing lamp and home furnishing manufacturers in  Dallas, Texas. Edythe worked hard to assist her husband at the store  while raising their children and becoming an active member of their  community. She served as a precinct chairman and was an avid volunteer  at her church for local events.  In 2017, Edythe was widowed after 72 years of marriage. Together,  Richard and Edythe had 5 children, 12 grandchildren, and 15 great- grandchildren.  Today, Edythe remains independent in mindset and in ability. Her  pioneering spirit and moral resolve continue to serve as an inspiration  to her family.  Edythe Kengla Swann's life story exemplifies the opportunity afforded  to descendants of immigrants who pursue challenging careers that help  this country grow and whose self-determination and commitment to family  help to maintain the strength of American culture.  Mr. Speaker, Edythe Kengla Swann has lived a long life filled with  joy, love, and above all, a pioneering spirit. I am proud to recognize  her on this joyous occasion and know that her family and friends love  her and are proud of her. I wish Edythe many more years of health and  happiness in the future.  As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for their  country during these difficult times for our military men and women who  protect us from external threats and for our first responders who  protect us here at home.  Mr. Speaker, I hope all Americans have a great holiday season and a  very happy and joyous Christmas.    "
