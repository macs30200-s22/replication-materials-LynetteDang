Greg Stanton,1.0714024305343628,D," Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Clean  Economy Jobs and Innovation Act.  To better position ourselves for the 21st century economy, we need to  invest in energy-efficient infrastructure that is both sustainable and  makes good business sense. This bill does that by incorporating my  legislation to reauthorize the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block  Grant program to provide grants to States, local governments, and our  Native American Tribes to reduce fossil fuel emissions and conserve  energy.  When this program was last funded, local governments were able to  pursue a large range of projects, from energy retrofits to deployment  of LED street lighting and solar energy systems to electric vehicle  charging stations and alternative fuel pumps.  A national evaluation of the program's effectiveness found that with  just 1 year of funding, 25.7 million metric tons of carbon equivalent  was avoided. And $5.2 billion in cumulative energy bill savings were  produced, 70 percent of which were realized by residential customers.  Just imagine what we can achieve with the dedicated, multiyear  funding this bill provides. It will create jobs, help consumers save on  their energy bills, open new opportunities for local governments to  invest in energy conservation, and reduce carbon pollution.  Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Pallone for his leadership on this  legislation.    "
