Andy Barr,2.2088539600372314,R," Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of long-delayed  legislation to deliver more resources to the [["", Page , H7296, ] American people to defeat the COVID-19 virus and provide much-needed  relief from government-imposed lockdowns of the economy.  Ultimately, no amount of government spending can substitute for a  fully functioning, open economy free of government lockdowns. But I am  confident this relief package, which provides over $284 billion to  reload and strengthen the Paycheck Protection Program, will help bridge  the gap until COVID-19 vaccines are widely distributed. It does so in a  fiscally responsible way by rescinding and reallocating $429 billion in  Federal Reserve emergency lending authority, and it repurposes unused  PPP funds.  Importantly, this bill provides effective, targeted relief, with a  net price tag of approximately $325 billion in new outlays. It does not  include the liberal wish list that was the centerpiece of the Speaker's  originally $3.4 trillion Heroes Act, a fiscally reckless proposal that  needlessly delayed this reasonable bipartisan compromise.  For months, I have called on Congress and the administration to  simplify the PPP forgiveness application for small businesses to ease  their burdens and ensure lender participation. Today, that goal becomes  a reality.  I also support the bill's extension of troubled debt restructuring  relief, which allows lenders to work with their borrowers to modify  loans. And I strongly support its provision to ensure small businesses  can deduct expenses covered by PPP loans.  While it has taken far too long to get to this point, the bill we are  passing today will bring much-needed help to American workers,  families, and small businesses, without putting more massive amounts of  debt on the American people.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.    "
