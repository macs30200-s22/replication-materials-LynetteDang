Joe Cunningham,1.9034206867218015,D," Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise with honor to address this  Chamber one last time. And I say ``with honor,'' because it has been  truly that to serve the people of South Carolina's First Congressional  District. I want to thank them for that opportunity, particularly  because, by most accounts, I never should have been here in the first  place.  I was reminded of that over the Thanksgiving holiday as I walked on  the beach on Sullivan's Island with my 2-year-old son, Boone. We were  out there searching for a sandcastle that he had built the day before,  but I knew it had been washed away by the tides.  I thought about the slim chances I had of making it here back in  2018. And then my defeat 2 years later. It became apparent that  political victories and losses are as transient and vulnerable as my  son's sandcastle on the beach. Especially in a district like ours, a  Democrat in a ruby red and gerrymandered district that President Trump  carried by 13 points back in 2016, one that had not been served by a  Democrat in my lifetime.  But we made it here by promising something different, by promising to  work with one another, reach across the aisle, listen to those we may  not agree with, and get things done.  Washington, D.C., was rife with partisanship and chaos. However, I  didn't arrive 2 years ago to simply complain; I came to roll up my  sleeves and be part of the solution. Or, as the old adage goes, I did  not come to curse the darkness, but to light a candle.  But it wasn't just about talk; it was about action. We said we would  work across the aisle, and I was ranked the fourth most bipartisan  Member in Congress.  I said I would work with anyone to get things done, and President  Trump signed two of my bills into law.  I promised to protect our beautiful shorelines in South Carolina, and  we passed my bipartisan bill that did exactly that.  We showed that working together can manifest remarkable results, all  of which was made possible by the dedication of my incredible staff and  with the love and support of my family.  Sadly though, here in Washington, D.C., bipartisanship and civility  seem to be the exception and not the rule. In my short tenure, I have  been disappointed with a lot that I have encountered.  I have seen Members consistently put their party ahead of their own  people; embracing conspiracy theories or arguments detached from  reality while knowing better and, sometimes, admitting so privately.  I have seen Members mock the President behind his back and praise him  to his face; loathe him in private and worship him on television.  I have seen them intentionally spread misinformation and lies, flirt  with white supremacists, and pander to the most extreme voices in our  society.  And it has been for one reason and one reason alone: self- preservation; people more interested in protecting themselves and their  party than protecting our country; more interested in keeping their job  than doing their job.  Such reckless and selfish behavior has created a system where most  politicians can't lose and most Americans can't win. And when it is  time to tackle the greatest challenges before us, our leaders cannot  even agree on the problems, let alone the solutions.  Today's elected leaders bear a tremendous responsibility to be the  custodians of our young and fragile democracy. And make no mistake, our  democracy has been battered and bruised, but it is not yet broken. And [["", Page , H7233, ] to save it, we must agree on one basic truth: that the other side is  not the enemy. The enemy is the stubbornness of our own biases.  {time} 1215  The enemy is a political system that seeks to divide us for sport.  Let's fight that and not each other. Our country is facing some serious  issues right now, and our country will be much better served if  Democrats and Republicans can come together.  My grandfather always told me that you can get through about any  problem if you actually sit down with somebody and have a beer  together. I have been trying to work with people since the first day I  got here. I won't ever stop reaching across the aisle or trying to work  with one another or sitting down and having a beer and listening to  each other.  For the betterment of this country, we have to come together. We have  to sit down, listen to each other, and maybe even have a beer.  In the spirit of bipartisanship and cooperation, I raise this glass  to my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans.    "
