Maxine Waters,2.8365111351013184,D," Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  The relief in this bill is desperately needed, as families struggle  during the pandemic crisis. The negotiations were difficult. They were  tough. I wish we could have done even more, but I am pleased we have  done as well as we could have done to provide relief for so many in  desperate need for their government to come to their aid.  As chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee, I am proud to have  secured $25 billion in emergency rental assistance. We need much more.  We also got an extension of the eviction moratorium and $12 billion in  low-cost, long-term capital and grants to the minority depository  institutions and the credit unions and the community development  financial institutions.  I thank Ranking Member McHenry, Chairman Crapo, and Ranking Member  Brown for working with me on these provisions.  I am so pleased that the legislation includes stimulus payments for  families and individuals. Not enough, but I am pleased.  I am also pleased it includes new funding for unemployment insurance.  Not enough, but I am pleased.  I am also pleased we have support for Los Angeles International  Airport in my district and small business forgivable PPP loans. This  bill will also expand the amount of PPP loans for which restaurants are  eligible by a considerable amount.  Let me be clear: Much more is needed, but this bill is a most  important first step, and I am very pleased that we are able to come to  the aid of all of our constituents.  I thank Nancy Pelosi for the tremendous job that she did in  negotiating to get us to this point.    "
