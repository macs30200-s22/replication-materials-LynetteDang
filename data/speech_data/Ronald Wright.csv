Ronald Wright,0.5503163933753967,R," Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment  which would remove harmful language that seeks to upend religious  freedom protections for organizations across America.  Earlier this year, the Department of Labor took an important step in  preserving the Constitution and ensuring the rights of religious  employers. It is simple: Faith-based groups should be on equal footing  as they compete with other employers without having to give up their  sincerely held religious beliefs. Organizations such as the Salvation  Army and Catholic Charities should not be afraid to partner with the  Federal Government to help Americans.  Unfortunately, if House Democrats have their way and roll back these  important religious protections, these organizations will face  uncertainty and confusion in the Federal contracting process, possibly  opting out altogether.  Beyond the fact that it is wrong to tell these organizations that  they cannot work with the Federal Government to provide essential  services, it is flat-out unconstitutional.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand by their commitment to the  Constitution and protect religious liberty [["", Page , H4139, ] for all Americans by supporting my amendment.    "
