Collin Peterson,0.5527387261390686,D," Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I thank the gentleman for his kind words and for his willingness to  work with us over these last number of years.  With this bill, we got just about all of our work done. We have the  CFTC reauthorization we didn't get done, but everything else is off the  plate. So that is good.  We made good progress. We will, both of us, ride off into the sunset,  I think, feeling that we have done a decent job.  So, again, I thank Mr. Conaway and all members of the committee for  the work that they do and wish them well in the next Congress.  Mr. Speaker, I ask everybody to unanimously support "", S. 4054, ', and I  yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, ', S. 4054, '.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
