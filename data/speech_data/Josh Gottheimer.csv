Josh Gottheimer,0.8726993799209595,D," Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, they said it couldn't be done, that  Democrats and Republicans could actually come together, not only in the  House, but in the Senate, too, and pass a COVID-19 emergency relief  package. But, finally, after 9 months, it is about to happen. We are  about to cross the finish line. This is as close to a Christmas miracle  as you can find in a normally polarized Washington.  {time} 1700  With the virus raging across the Nation, the 50-Member strong  bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus put country over party and helped  craft a package that will help put food on the table, distribute  vaccines to our communities, save our struggling small businesses, put  money in the pockets of American families, and help keep families in  their homes.  This emergency relief package wouldn't have happened without the  weeks of hard work from the Problem Solvers Caucus and a bipartisan  group of Senators who put country ahead of party to help our families,  small businesses, and communities. This was truly a model for how we  should govern in Washington.  This marks a critical downpayment in our ongoing fight against COVID.  If you look in New Jersey, where 1 in 500 have lost their lives, and 30  percent of small businesses are out, we clearly have more work to do.  Madam Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan, bicameral  legislation, which is a critical step forward.    "
