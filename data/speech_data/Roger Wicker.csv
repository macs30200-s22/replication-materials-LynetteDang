Roger Wicker,3.558171033859253,R," Mr. WICKER. Madam President, the Senator, my good friend from Utah,  has asked unanimous consent that we pass the version of the bill I  authored. Ordinarily, I would very much appreciate that. The problem  with his request is that in this Congress, it prevents us from acting  today to get to this ZTE and Huawei problem. We have a solution, and we  need to get started on it.  Let me also make the point that some things are worth paying for, and  protecting Americans, protecting our electronic system, our broadband  communications from the Chinese-owned Huawei and ZTE is worth paying  for.  What my unanimous consent request would have done, had the Senator  not objected, is we would have passed the bill and leave the issue of  how we fund it to another day. Perhaps the appropriators would have  decided to appropriate money for it. Had they done so, they would have  operated within the budget caps, as the Appropriations Committee has  done, and found room, found some offsets, and paid for it that way.  The proposal I made, that was objected to by my friend from Utah,  would also have left open the possibility of having a pay-for by the  sale of some spectrum.  I regret that the Senator is objecting based on how we will pay for  this very needed expenditure down the road. So I am compelled to object  to my good friend's unanimous consent request.    "
