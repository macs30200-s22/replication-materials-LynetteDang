Mikie Sherrill,0.6107538938522339,D," Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, it has been more than 250 days since we  passed the CARES Act, and it is past time that we pass a second round.  When this pandemic hit, despite being in one of the most partisan  times in our Nation's history, we came together in Congress to pass  badly needed help for the American people: PPP loans for small  businesses; State and local funding to help with contact tracing,  testing, and grants to those in need.  We passed an eviction moratorium so people could stay in their homes  and nutrition aid for the millions of families who suddenly are  experiencing food insecurity.  Now that we have good news about vaccines, now that we have hope for  the future, we have to pass another round of help so businesses can  make it through the winter, children can have access to food, families  can stay in their homes, and kids can get back to school.  There is a bipartisan deal that the Senate and House Members are on  board with, a deal that would provide relief to millions.  Let's once again show the American people that we are there for them  when it counts.    "
