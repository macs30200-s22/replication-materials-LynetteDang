Jody Hice,0.8391735553741455,R," Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Colorado, my good friend, for leading this Special Order. I am indeed  honored to rise and celebrate and honor the book that, without  question, has transformed my life, brought light into my life and to  the entire world, and to join my colleagues in recognizing the most  significant book in the history of our Nation, its founding, and its  history throughout. Of course, we are talking about the Bible.  As a pastor of 25-plus years, prior to coming to Congress, this  opportunity to speak the Word of God on this floor is an extremely  important thing to me personally and to our Nation.  There is no question that Benjamin Franklin--and we have many, many,  many, many examples--and I have a lot of them in my office. But  Benjamin Franklin spoke very clear truth when he said that famous  statement that: ``The longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see  of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men.''  Without a doubt, it is in the Bible that we learn about the greatness  of God. We learn that He is the object of true worship, that He is the  fount of all blessings, that He is the light of the world. It is in the  Bible that we learn about the holiness of God. And, yes, it is in the  Bible that we learn about the sinfulness of every one of us as human  beings, that we have broken God's moral standard in one of a thousand  different ways.  But it is in the Bible also that we learn how much God loves us, and  in His great love, He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to pay the penalty  for our sins on that cross. It is in the Bible we learn that all of us  who trust in Him can receive the greatest gift that anyone could ever  receive, and that is the gift of forgiveness, which all of us need.  I cherish this moment to speak about the truths of God's Word. Our  country, as we all know, has been referred to over and over and over  throughout history as a shining city on a hill. But we also know today  that we are a Nation that stands at a critical crossroad. I believe it  is times like this, more than other times, perhaps, that the verse that  was quoted earlier, Psalm 119, verse 105, means so much to us. We need  to heed that God's Word is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our  path. More than ever, we need to heed, as a nation, as a body, as  leaders in this great Chamber, the Word of God and let it become our  light and our pathway.  It is, I believe, our responsibility, as leaders in this country, to  point our constituents, at least to the point of reminding them that  the Bible is extremely significant, not only to us as individuals, but  to us as a Nation, and that we need to encourage people to go back to  the teachings, the principles, the truths, the eternal truths of God's  Word. How different our Nation would be with that.  Again, I want to thank my friend for leading this Special Order and  all of my colleagues for taking time to come to speak to the truths of  God's Word.    "
