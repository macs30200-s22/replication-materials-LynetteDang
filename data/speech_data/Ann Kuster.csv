Ann Kuster,0.987284779548645,D," Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak of the  urgent need to pass bipartisan COVID-19 relief legislation as Congress  works to conclude our work this year.  Families, businesses, and workers in New Hampshire are feeling the  continued pain and impact of this pandemic as cases reach record highs  in my State and hospitals and frontline health workers brace for the  expected surge.  This week, I was pleased to see Democrats and Republicans in the  House and the Senate come together to find common ground and release a  promising framework that we should consider immediately. This  legislation would bolster our public health and economic response to  COVID-19 to help us get through the long, cold, dark winter ahead.  Democrats and Republicans won't get everything they want, but we need  to come together and put politics aside.  This legislation includes new funding for the Paycheck Protection  Program for small businesses, State and local funding for our first  responders, extended unemployment, and critical funding to help with  the distribution of the promising COVID-19 vaccine, as well as $5  billion in funding to combat the opioid epidemic, which, tragically,  continues to rage.  It is time to come together and get the job done.    "
