Nanette Barragan,0.8301119804382324,D," Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of "", H.R. 4499, ', the  NIMHD Research Endowment Revitalization Act, a bill I introduced with  my friend and colleague from Georgia, Congressman Carter.  This legislation moves us closer to ending the disparities in public  health between minority communities and other Americans. We need to  understand why people in minority communities are more likely to get  certain illnesses and how we can prevent that. ', H.R. 4499, "" will fund the  research that will help us find solutions.  If signed into law, this bill will once again allow for current and  former NIMHD or HRSA Centers of Excellence to receive research  endowment funding, money that is critical in the fight to reduce  minority health disparities.  The Research Endowment Program at the National Institute on Minority  Health and Health Disparities provides funding to the endowments of  academic institutions across the country, such as Charles Drew  University in my district.  The goals of the program include:  Promoting minority health and health disparities research capacity  and infrastructure;  Increasing the diversity and strength of the scientific workforce;  and  Enhancing the recruitment and retention of individuals from health  disparity populations that are underrepresented in the scientific  workforce.  Charles Drew University has stated that this legislation and the  funding are critical to their mission and that they support this  legislation because:  ``Restoring eligibility would allow the University to continue its  historic focus on research to close the gap between the burden of  illness and premature mortality experienced more commonly by  communities of color, as well as other medically underserved  populations, as compared to the nation as a whole. It would also help  to grow and enhance the University's capacity and infrastructure for  health disparities research within the Urban Health Institute.''  During the COVID health emergency, where communities of color are  once again disproportionately affected, research into health  disparities is more crucial than ever.  I want to once again thank my colleague Congressman Carter for co- leading this bill with me, as well as the other bipartisan cosponsors:  Congresswoman Kelly, Congressman Rogers, and the late John Lewis. I  also want to thank Chairman Pallone for working with me to help move  this important bill through the Committee.  I urge all my colleagues to vote yes on the NIMHD Research Endowment  Revitalization Act so that these schools can continue this important  research on minority health disparities.  Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science Statement on "", H.R. 4499, '  Charles R. Drew University of Medicine in Science (CDU) is   in strong support of ', H.R. 4499, ' which amend the Public Health   Service Act to provide that the authority of the Director of   the National Institute on Minority Health and Health   Disparities to make certain research endowments applies with   respect to both current and former centers of excellence, and   for other purposes.  If enacted ', H.R. 4499, "" would reinstate the University's   eligibility for NIMHD endowment grants that were withdrawn   because the University had received endowment grants for 10   years despite being underfunded for its critical health   disparities research. [["", Page , H5805, ]  Restoring eligibility would allow the University to continue   its historic focus on research to close the gap between the   burden of illness and premature mortality experienced more   commonly by communities of color, as well as other medically   underserved populations, as compared to the nation as a   whole. It would also help to grow and enhance the   University's capacity and infrastructure for health   disparities research within the Urban Health Institute.  Respectfully Submitted,  David M. Carlisle, MD, PhD,  President and CEO, Charles R. Drew  University of Medicine and Science.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
