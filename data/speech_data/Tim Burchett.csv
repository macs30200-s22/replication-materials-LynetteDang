Tim Burchett,0.4498873949050903,R," Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, the American entrepreneurial spirit is the  bedrock of our Nation's economy, creating good-paying jobs, solving  everyday problems, and providing the goods and services we rely on. I  rise today to celebrate the A.G. Heins Company, which rode the  entrepreneurial spirit from humble beginnings to 100 years of success  in our community.  Currently in its fourth generation of family ownership, the A.G.  Heins Company has long provided building materials to the east  Tennessee region. The company provides necessary resources to complete  projects of all sizes, from individual household repairs, to  construction at the University of Tennessee.  Staying in business for 100 years is no easy accomplishment, and the  A.G. Heins Company persevered through many challenging economic times,  such as the Great Depression and the Second World War. The company's  history is a reminder that small businesses can grow and innovate even  in the face of adversity, Mr. Speaker.  I extend my congratulations to the Heins family as they celebrate  their 100th year in business this month, and I wish them many more  years of success.    "
