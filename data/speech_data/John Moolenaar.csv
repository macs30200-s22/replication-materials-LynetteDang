John Moolenaar,0.0497006773948669,R," Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I support the legislation finishing the appropriations  process for 2021 because it funds important priorities for Michigan  families. It includes funding for the construction of a new lock at the  Soo Locks, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, rural broadband  internet access, and NIH research into cures for cancer and  Alzheimer's.  Of course, there is more work to do.  Many communities have been affected by disasters this year, including  my district, where two dams failed and communities were flooded.  Congress should do more to help all communities affected by natural  disasters this year, and I will be doing everything I can to help those  in my district apply to receive Federal assistance.  I am glad we have this bill done for the American people, and I look  forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle to craft  bipartisan legislation again in the new year.    "
