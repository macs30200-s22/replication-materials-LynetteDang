Raul Grijalva,3.156712293624878,D," Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to  give me an opportunity to speak on behalf of ', H.R. 2420, "", legislation  introduced by our esteemed friend and colleague, the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Serrano), a pioneer and a powerful advocate for Latino people  in his time in this Congress. And the whole Nation, all Americans have  benefited from his work, and we are all grateful for what he has done  for many people in this country.  I have a brief story. You will hear a lot about the statistical  importance and the history that needs to be told, but I have a brief  story. You know, I am a first-generation American citizen. My parents  migrated and immigrated into this country with the distinct goal of  giving their kids a chance. And to that end, they did. But, see, my  story is not unique, nor is it, for that matter, extraordinary. It is  the story that binds all the diversity of Latinos together, a shared  experience and a shared demand for respect, fairness, and to be treated  as equals.  The Latino Museum, this vote, comes at a time of forced divisions in  this country, attempts to demonize and marginalize Latinos by the  highest voice in this land. Our American history and identity are also  Latino history and identity and, through this history, the United  States exists.  Latino history, like American history, is ongoing, it is evolving,  but to tell the full stories, the scars, the current wounds, the  changes, the unsung leaders in all arenas, with that story also comes  hope. And today and tomorrow, as we honor our great friend and leader  and beacon, John Lewis, here at the Capitol, for being the person that  he was, and a great American--you know, my proudest moment and  privilege was to be arrested with him in a civil disobedience protest  on behalf of immigrants, DACA recipients, and their families.  So today, we are voting for 2420, and we are saying ``yes'' to the  Latino Museum, but I think, more importantly, this ``yes'' vote by  Congress is also a vote that extends respect, provides acknowledgment,  provides equity, and begins to tell the story of all Americans in this  country.  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation.  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd), my good friend, a gentleman who has  been leading on Latino issues in our Republican Conference, and someone  who bravely served our country in the CIA, but also, will be greatly  missed in this institution.
