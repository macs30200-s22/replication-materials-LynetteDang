Donald Norcross,0.2702898383140564,D," Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and  certainly for his leadership in bringing this conference report to the  floor for the 60th year. And certainly, I take a moment to thank Mac  Thornberry, who this conference report is named after, for his  leadership, and certainly Mike Rogers. They are the type of Members  that we all should look toward in terms of being bipartisan and working  toward a goal.  Mr. Speaker, this conference report continues the Tactical Air and  Land Forces Subcommittee's long tradition of bipartisanship to make  America's Armed Forces the best in the world. I commend the hard work  of our Members, my colleagues, our staff, certainly in these unusual  and demanding circumstances brought on by the coronavirus.  I also thank Ranking Member Hartzler for her leadership and  commitment to working toward a goal of keeping America safe. Our  cooperation has kept us focused on what is truly important. We have  delivered a defense bill that meets the modernization and readiness  needs of our Nation's air and land forces.  This bill carefully manages our military resources while increasing  the Department of Defense program oversight to make sure that we do our  job, particularly in the F-35, our most advanced weapons system and  also the most expensive in U.S. history.  But we are also looking at manned and unmanned intelligence,  surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, and continued oversight of  the Army's new modernization strategy with respect to Army aviation,  including the CH-47 Chinook helicopter.  Also, I take a moment for our national defense and the priorities of  keeping America safe and New Jersey safe while ensuring the KC-10  refuelers are not retired prematurely and making sure the KC-46s are  being delivered on time.  I am grateful this bill includes that 3 percent pay raise, taking  care of military families and also providing affordable childcare on  bases. Making sure that your children are safe is incredibly important.  I am proud of the hard work this committee has done to continue to  serve America's national security interests.  Mr. Speaker, this bill deserves our support, and I urge a ``yes''  vote.    "
