Jon Tester,1.7731460332870483,D," Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, we have had a fruitful day here today. We  passed a lot of bills. We did it in a bipartisan way. I want to thank  both Leader McConnell and Leader Schumer for their good work, as well  as Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Leahy for their good work on  these bills.  Today, I am going to do something that I have never done before. I am  going to read an obituary about a man I don't believe I have ever met,  even though I was in the Veterans' Home of Columbia Falls while he was  there. This obituary was passed on to me by my wife, who got it from a  friend. It is incredibly powerful because, quite frankly, it is about  one man, but it is actually about a generation of men and women who  served in Vietnam.  This guy's name was William Ebeltoft. The obituary goes like this:  ``Not everyone who lost his life in Vietnam died there.''   The saying is true for CW2 William C. Ebeltoft. He died on   December 15, 2019 at the Veteran's Home in Columbia Falls,   Montana. He died 50 years after he lost, in Vietnam, all that   underpinned his life. He was 73 years old.  Everyone called him ``Bill.'' He was loved by the nursing   staff who cared for him. He was loved by the fellow veterans   with whom he lived; those he helped when he was able and   entertained with funny German slang and a stint at the piano   when he could. He was a virtuoso when playing ``Waltzing   Matilda.''  His small family loved him dearly. He was preceded in death   by his parents, Paul and Mary Ebeltoft of Dickinson, North   Dakota, whose devotion and care for their war-damaged boy was   strong and unfailing. He is survived by his brother, Paul   Ebeltoft, and the one he loved as the sister he never had,   Paul's wife, Gail. . . . It is difficult to write about Bill.   He lived three lives: before, during and after Vietnam.   Before Vietnam, Bill was a handsome man, who wore clothing   well; a man with white, straight teeth that showed in his   ready smile. A state champion trap shooter, a low handicap   golfer, a 218-average bowler, a man of quick, earthy wit,   with a fondness for children, old men, hunting, fast cars,   and a cold Schlitz. He told jokes well.  During Vietnam, he lived with horrors of which he would   only seldom speak. Slow Motion Four, Bill's personal call   sign, logged thousands of helicopter flight hours performing   Forward Support Base resupply landings, medical evacuations,   exfils and gun ship runs. We know of him there mostly through   medals for valor he received, and these were many. . . .   While attempting to resupply B Company, [Warrant Officer]   Ebeltoft's co-pilot became wounded. Realizing the importance   of the mission WO Ebeltoft elected to attempt completion of   the mission. Due to his superior knowledge of the aircraft,   the helicopter was kept under control during the period in   which the pilot was wounded and the ship was under fire.   Remaining under attack from automatic weapons fire, the   supply mission was successfully completed. While unloading   the supplies, WO Ebeltoft received word that there were five   emergency medical evacuation cases located 200 meters to his   rear. WO Ebeltoft re-positioned his helicopter and picked up   the wounded personnel. While evacuating the wounded, the   commanding officer of Company B was injured. WO Ebeltoft   again maneuvered his aircraft to enable evacuation of the   injured officer. WO Ebeltoft then proceeded to evacuate all   injured personnel by the fastest possible means. Upon   completion, examination of the aircraft revealed that the   aircraft had sustained nine enemy .30 caliber hits.  Bill got the medal, of course, but he would have been the   last to say anything about it. The citation shows the type of   man that he, and many of his brothers-in-arms in Vietnam   were; and still are today, albeit battered hard and unfairly   by the cruel winds of the time in which they fought.  After being discharged as a decorated hero, Bill had a   rough re-entry into civilian life. It is not necessary to   recount Bill's portion of what is an all-too-common story for   wartime veterans, particularly those of the Vietnam era. It   may be sufficient to say that after a run at business, a   marriage and while grappling daily with his demons, his   mental faculties escaped him. Bill became a resident of the   Veteran's Home in Columbia Falls, Montana in 1994. He lived   there for the next 26 years.  At the Home, the patina of his memory covered life's   sorrows, and it was a blessing. Bill was happy there, living   a life that was a strange mixture of hunting stories, pickup   trucks and memories of some of his better times with women,   friends and the outdoor life. Bill denied that anyone he   loved had died; could not understand why anyone would fill   with gas at four bucks a gallon when ``Johnny's Standard   sells it for 27 cents;'' and still ``drove'' his 1968 Dodge   Charger. He was unfailingly courteous. His largest concerns   were making his smoke breaks and finding his wallet (a search   of 26 years.)  In the past year, Bill's shaky grip on physical health also   slipped through his fingers. Yet, despite this, what we loved   in him remained, if only sometimes as a shadow. Even after   his serious decline, suffering fractures because of falls,   Bill would tell the staff that he was ``just fine'' and not   to worry about him. Thin, hunched over, propelling himself   with one foot, he would wheel himself into the room of a bed-  ridden veteran and sit there, next to the bed, unspeaking.   The nursing staff was certain that Bill thought that the man   in bed was lonely and needed company.  Bill was always a proud man, remembering himself as he was   in 1969, not as he became. Who are we to suggest differently?   His was not a life that many would wish for, but in some   ways, Bill was a lucky man. He was surrounded to the end by   staff who enjoyed and respected him. He had a chance to be   helpful to others who were doing less well than he. And the   passing of the seasons never diminished his plans for another   elk hunt or to ``see that beautiful girl again this   weekend.''  When a small slice of reality penetrated his pleasant   confusion, Bill struggled to understand why he was where he   was. Prematurely aged, his worldly goods in a small dresser,   not knowing who the President might be or remembering why he   should care, Bill's losses were greater than most of us could   endure. Yet, to those who love him, his brother and his   brother's wife, and their sons, he will always be a brave,   accomplished man, more generous than was wise, more trusting   than was safe.  It is not possible to wrap your arms around a loved one who   leaves. But it is possible to wrap your heart around a   memory. Bill's will be well taken care of.  I yield the floor.    "
