Steve Scalise,0.0695809498429298,R," Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  As the gentleman from Maryland pointed out, we know government  funding expires at midnight. Clearly, we have been working for days in  a very productive way to get close to an agreement on both funding of  government as well as COVID relief. We are not quite there on all of  these details, but we are eager to see if we can get this resolved.  As the gentleman knows, everybody, Members on both sides are very  interested in finding out what the schedule will be. I appreciate that  update, and I imagine that means we will stay tuned and see if, between  now and 5 p.m., we can get that resolved.    "
