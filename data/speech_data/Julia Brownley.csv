Julia Brownley,2.2297823429107666,D," Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  "", H.R. 3798, ', the Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act, my bill  to ensure [[', Page , H4771, ] that women veterans have access to the same contraception coverage as  women currently serving in the military and on the same basis of women  who receive private healthcare.  I thank the chairman for working with me to advance this legislation,  and I am proud that my bill passed the committee with broad bipartisan  support.  As you may know, because of the Affordable Care Act, all women using  civilian health insurance may access basic contraceptive services, like  the pill or an IUD, without a copay.  Last year, the Access to Contraception for Servicemembers and  Dependents Act passed with overwhelming bipartisan support as part of  the annual National Defense Authorization Act to ensure that TRICARE  also provides this basic health benefit to servicemembers and their  dependents. While this was an important step, women veterans currently  do not receive this benefit from the VA.  Clearly, we need to make sure all women who have served our country  receive the same care. My bill will fix this inequity.  The benefits of contraception are widely recognized. Choosing when or  if to have a family is essential to women's health and to their  economic security.  Today, there are 2 million women veterans living in the United  States, and women comprise the fastest growing subpopulation of both  the military and veteran populations. Yet, many of their health needs  go unaddressed in a VA system that has not evolved to equitably serve a  rapidly changing population.  As the chairwoman of the Women's Veterans Task Force and chair of the  House Veterans' Affairs' Subcommittee on Health, members of the task  force and I have worked to identify disparities in healthcare for women  veterans and, where necessary, introduce, advocate for, and pass  legislation that eliminates those gaps.  Mr. Speaker, our veterans have sacrificed so much for us and our  country. It is way past time that we address this inequity and fix this  glaring gap in care of our women veterans. I urge my colleagues to  support our women veterans and vote ``yes'' on "", H.R. 3798, "".  Mr. Speaker, before I conclude, I, too, would just like to publicly  acknowledge my gratitude to Dr. Roe. When the Speaker says the  ``gentleman from Tennessee,'' I believe he truly is a gentleman in the  eyes, I think, of all Members of Congress and, certainly, particularly  mine.  He is a great storyteller that underscores the point that he is  making at all times. There is no question that his leadership and his  advocacy for our veterans, both men and women, are untouchable and  unwavering. I would say how much I have enjoyed working with him on the  Committee of Veterans' Affairs, and I know that he will be missed by  the entire House, but sorely missed within the Committee of Veterans'  Affairs and our daily work there.  I thank him for all that he has done. Whatever his next chapter is in  his life, I hope that he and his new bride enjoy every minute of it.  Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I very, very much appreciate the incredibly kind words.  Some of those stories are probably even true that I tell.  Mr. Speaker, I would take a point of personal privilege before I  close. This will probably be the last time I am down here to speak on  the House floor as the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs before this Congress adjourns in January.  Mr. Speaker, what an honor and privilege it has been. And you cannot  be successful--and I think the chairman will also emphasize this-- without an incredible staff. I have been so blessed with very, very,  very competent people on both sides of the aisle. And it has been fun  working with Ray and the gentleman's staff, and I thank him for that.  They have always been respectful, and I have appreciated that.  Mr. Speaker, you know it is probably time to retire from Congress  when you have delivered one of your staff members, which I have, that  is on our side.  Mr. Speaker, it is not about us. It is about the veterans that we  serve--all of us in this incredible body. How many times in your life  do you get an opportunity to really do good for people?  I will tell you what has influenced me. I grew up in a military town,  Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Clarksville, Tennessee, where the 101st  Airborne is. My scoutmaster, First Sergeant Thomas E. Thayer, was  killed in 1965 in Vietnam. He left four children. I saw what it did to  that family. I have never forgotten that.  After my service was over--I served in Korea in 1973-1974 in the  Second Infantry Division--I came back home, saw what happened to our  Nation's veterans, how they were treated. That has changed.  I am thankful that this country no longer treats the veterans like  they did my Vietnam brothers and sisters who served.  We had the opportunity in this committee, in a bipartisan way, as I  said, to make a difference. In the last Congress, we passed the  Accountability and Whistleblower Protection bill; the Appeals  Modernization that has helped so many people; the Forever GI Bill, and  I used the GI bill when I got out of the military, and it helped me as  a young family, and I know how it transformed this country after World  War II; the MISSION Act, and I could go on and on--the bills we passed  yesterday and the bills we passed today, and we will pass Congresswoman  Brownley's bill in just a moment here.  I got an email last week. We get these all the time. We talked about  the blue water Navy for, I don't know, 10 years, I guess. I get this  email from a widow, who is a veteran, whose husband died in his late  forties with complications of Agent Orange. He served on a service ship  outside Vietnam that offloaded Agent Orange.  Finally, after all these years and the work, Mr. Speaker, we got this  passed in February, I think, of 2019. She got backpay and a stipend for  her and her family for the service that her husband had done. She was a  veteran who had served, too, but not there. I thank the entire body for  doing that because you made a difference in this veteran's life.  Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank the body, the committee, all the people  who have worked, and I certainly want to support Ms. Brownley's bill  and her kind words--I much appreciate that--and I encourage all Members  to vote for this.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
