David McKinley,0.978335440158844,R," Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of ', H.R. 3361, "", the RIVER Act, and thank  Chairman Tonko and Congressman Loebsack for working with us in a  bipartisan way on this important legislation.  This RIVER Act reauthorizes key hydropower production and efficiency  incentives through 2036. Boosting hydropower production will ensure  that Americans have access to affordable, clean energy.  As Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers has previously noted on  numerous occasions, only 3 percent of America's 91,000 dams generate  electricity because in part it takes 10 years to get a permit to  develop new hydropower projects.  This bill will help streamline and develop utilizing existing  infrastructure and overcome barriers to future projects.  I urge my colleagues to support the RIVER Act.  Mr. Speaker, I ask a point of personal privilege to address my  esteemed chairman.  Mr. Speaker, I say to my ranking member and my former chairman,  colleague, since I came here 10 years ago, coming from the business  sector nearly 50 years in private practice in the business of  engineering, I have been so impressed with the leadership we have had  in Energy and Commerce. It wasn't what I was expecting. You and Fred,  and even to some extent my friend, Frank, to some extent--Frank, don't  get carried away here.  I have seen you taking on some difficult issues and using humor, your  approach, you have been able to work through some difficult situations  coming up with solutions. So you are going to be missed. You and Mylene  have earned the break. But I think of all the legislation.  You have been in my house. You have come to West Virginia--``West by  God Virginia''--and I do appreciate what you have done for us, what you  have done on the opioid epidemic. It is still ravaging West Virginia  and across this country.  People have to understand that in West Virginia more people are going  to die from opioids than from COVID this year. This is still a problem,  but thanks to you, we are moving in the right direction.  I can't express enough how much you have meant to me in my career and  my confidence. The people's House has been in good hands under you, and  I very much appreciate your service. God bless all of you as you  continue in your retirement.    "
