Bill Posey,0.6386681199073792,R," Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I was hopeful that this resolution would  lead us to common ground. None of us here believes in discriminating  against our fellow Asian-American neighbors.  On March 23, President Trump said the Asian-American community ought  to be ``totally protected'' in light of the xenophobic attacks during  the coronavirus pandemic. ``It is very important that we totally  protect our Asian-American community in the United States and all  around the world,'' President Trump tweeted.  ``They're amazing people, and the spreading of the virus is not their  fault in any way, shape, or form,'' he said. ``They're working closely  with us to get rid of it,'' the President added. ``We will prevail  together.''  I have restauranteurs in my district who suffered from bullies  because of their heritage, so I asked my staff to prepare a resolution  to echo the President's sentiments. My staff reported to me that such a  resolution already existed, "", H. Res. 908, "", ostensibly to protect Asian  Americans.  On April 7, I signed onto what I considered to be a good faith effort  to protect Asian Americans. I am more than saddened to see that this  resolution and today's debate is being used for nothing more than to  malign and vilify the President of the United States, just as the  President and congressional Republicans have been called domestic  enemies in the last couple of days. I would hope for more, but, sadly,  this body has chosen to take the low road.  This debate has devolved into finger-pointing, name-calling, and  scoring political points. Rather than reaching a high watermark for  bringing us all together, it has further ripped apart the fabric of  America. I am deeply disappointed and will not be a party to today's  partisan exercise that is more about scoring political points than  rebuilding America.  We should be working together to help all Americans recover, to  investigate COVID-19, which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of  deaths around the world, trillions lost and trillions more spent  responding to COVID. Lives and dreams have been shattered.  We have a duty to all Americans to find a cure, to get to the bottom  of just how this pandemic started, and to do what we can to prevent it  from happening ever again in the future.    "
