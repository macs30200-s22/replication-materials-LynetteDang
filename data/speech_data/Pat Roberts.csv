Pat Roberts,1.3546299934387207,R," Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I am honored to pay tribute to Johnny  Isakson. I don't know how I could top anything that has been mentioned  by Senator Perdue and, especially, Senator Coons--Senator Chris Coons  has given us a charge to follow Johnny's example--and Senator Grassley  and now Senator Murray and everybody who will follow me.  I have a problem. I did all of this on Veterans Day. I tried to point  out that his committee has passed 57 bills. I don't know of any other  committee that has done that on behalf of the people who wear the  uniform of the United States--who do so much on our behalf--and, more  especially, for the VA and what that is all about. There has never been  a better chairman than Johnny Isakson. I said all of that. I also said,  in this body, there are those who choose ideology and partisan issues  while Johnny is someone who works with his colleagues to pass  legislation that benefits not only our Nation's veterans but every  American's pocketbook and daily life.  The reason I just sort of read through that is that we have just had  lunch wherein nearly every Senator was in attendance with the exception  of those who are running for President, and they would have liked to  have been there. By my count, there were seven standing ovations-- seven. Each Member, both of the leaders, and the people who have served  with Johnny either as a minority member or as a chairman gave their  amazing tributes to this wonderful man.  Isn't it amazing that in this very difficult time in the Senate, when  the bar of civility is about forehead high--you don't want to run into  it here--that here is a man who has given us a way out? I have never  seen that before.  Johnny has had, I think, 50 years of public service. I have him beat  if you add in staff time and 40 years of public service--by the way, of  being elected 24 to 0. I have never seen such an outpouring of  affection and genuine admiration for an individual, be he a Member of  the House or the Senate, as was experienced at this lunch.  It was Chris Coons who, during his tribute, said: Why don't we use  this as a wonderful way to see if we can get past all of the trials and  tribulations that we have gone through in the Senate and work together  for a change? People talked about, when they had come to the Senate,  that it wasn't this way. Actually, it was. Yet we look very fondly upon  the past. So I hope that people can take Chris's challenge to heart.  It is a pretty easy deal. Johnny knows it by heart, for that is who  he is; yet, if a person or a group of people or Senators in this body  love to come down here and make speech after speech--in many cases,  they are very partisan, and many of the younger Members do this--I give  them that. I mean, that is their right. I remember, in the early days  when I was in the House, that I did that a couple of times and then was  talked to by some of the senior Members who said: We don't do that here  in order to get along, especially in the all-powerful House Agriculture  Committee and now the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry  Committee. We always work together because we are nonpartisan on that  committee.  So you ignore that. Then, if you really do take the time to know that  individual, as opposed to the individual you have seen on the floor,  you will find out this is a person who is very interesting. You will  find out this is a person worth knowing. You will find out that you  have common ground. You will find out that you can get a vote for them  in order for them to vote for the farm bill or for a veterans' program  or for any other thing.  So I think that is the example that Johnny has set. I don't know if  there is anything more I can add after seven standing ovations and  obviously many, many people actually telling the truth about you. I  know, Johnny, it must be a little much for you. Frankly, I am getting a  little tired of it.  I would just like to say what I said back then when I was speaking of  your tremendous success as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee  when I said: ``Johnny, thank you for your service; now thank you for  your message; now thank you for being simply who you are.'' And I said:  ``Senators eventually come and Senators go.''  I do not think we will see the likes of Senator Johnny Isakson for  years to come. We love you. I love you. I will miss you greatly. Thank  you for your fortitude and courage in fighting Parkinson's as an  example to so many.  Semper fi, my dear friend.  I yield the floor.    "
