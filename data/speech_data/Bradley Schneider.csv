Bradley Schneider,1.4560552835464478,D," Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the frontline  heroes, especially our healthcare workers who are working tirelessly  under unbearable stresses to save lives.  I thank the researchers and scientists who are developing COVID  vaccines. But I also want to plead with my fellow citizens to act  responsibly to protect each other in this battle against a deadly  virus.  Today, Moderna announced remarkable results for a second vaccine on  the heels of Pfizer's recent announcement.  There is light at the end of the tunnel, but the tunnel is long, and  the road back is still many months away. We can't afford to let our  guard down or millions of Americans will get sick and thousands, tens  of thousands of our fellow citizens, our neighbors, and our family  members will needlessly die.  As I speak, America's hospitals, especially in rural and underserved  communities, are at capacity. They are airlifting patients to bigger  cities. We have reports of growing shortfalls of medical supplies and  staff. Our frontline healthcare workers desperately need our help.  As we enter the holiday season, I am begging Americans to stay  vigilant. Wear a mask, watch your distance, and wash your hands. If you  must gather, do so outside, even though it is cold. I know that you  want to see your families. I want to see mine. I know that the  sacrifice will not be easy, but I also know that there is pain.  We can do this. We can beat back this virus, but only if we do it  together. If we don't people will die, and God forbid you or your loved  one is the last to die before a vaccine.    "
