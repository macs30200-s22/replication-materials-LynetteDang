Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill ("", S. 4996, ') to ensure funding of the United  States trustees, extend temporary bankruptcy judgeships, and for other  purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Mfume). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Rhode Island?  There was no objection.  The text of the bill is as follows:  ', S. 4996, ""  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of   the United States of America in Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ``Bankruptcy Administration   Improvement Act of 2020''.  SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:  (1) Because of the importance of the goal that the   bankruptcy system is self-funded, at no cost to the taxpayer,   Congress has closely monitored the funding needs of the   bankruptcy system, including by requiring periodic reporting   by the Attorney General regarding the United States Trustee   System Fund.  (2) Congress has amended the various bankruptcy fees as   necessary to ensure that the bankruptcy system remains self-  supporting, while also fairly allocating the costs of the   system among those who use the system.  (3) Because the bankruptcy system is interconnected, the   result has been a system of fees, including filing fees,   quarterly fees in chapter 11 cases, and other fees, that   together fund the courts, judges, United States trustees, and   chapter 7 case trustees necessary for the bankruptcy system   to function.  (4) This Act and the amendments made by this Act--  (A) ensure adequate funding of the United States trustees,   supports the preservation of existing bankruptcy judgeships   that are urgently needed to handle existing and anticipated   increases in business and consumer caseloads, and provides   long-overdue additional compensation for chapter 7 case   trustees whose caseloads include chapter 11 reorganization   cases that were converted to chapter 7 liquidation cases; and  (B) confirm the longstanding intention of Congress that   quarterly fee requirements remain consistent across all   Federal judicial districts.  (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act and the amendments   made by this Act is to further the long-standing goal of   Congress of ensuring that the bankruptcy system is self-  funded, at no cost to the taxpayer.
