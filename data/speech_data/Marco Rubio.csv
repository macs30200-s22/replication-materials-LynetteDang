Marco Rubio,3.5885019302368164,R," Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague Senator Scott  for offering this and all of our colleagues and, of course, all of the  Senators who voted for it unanimously.  My colleague from Florida has already mentioned the three names of  those in the service of our country who lost their lives in Pensacola.  I will talk about them more in a moment.  I do want to say a couple of things. First, Pensacola really is one  of the hidden gems of the State that Senator Scott and I represent. To  understand Pensacola, you must understand that is it not just a city in  which a naval facility is located. The Navy is very [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7137"">Page S7137</a>, ] much a part of the fiber of that community. I would almost equate it to  a college town's relationship with a university; that is how much its  identity is connected to this naval air station. This attack wasn't  just an attack on this facility, but it was an attack on the heart and  soul of Pensacola as a community.  As I had an opportunity to visit in the aftermath of the attack, I  was not just deeply saddened by the loss of life but impacted, first,  by the way the community responded and, second, by some of the stories,  which I hope we will learn more about as the information comes out, of  extraordinary bravery--not just the first responders but others who  happened to be there at that time who exhibited extraordinary stories  of heroism in the face of evil in this terror attack. People rushed  into the building the gunshots were coming from instead of running away  as most people would do. I want to point out some of those things.  ENS Joshua Kaleb Watson, who was mentioned earlier, happened to be  the officer on deck at the time of the shooting, and he ran toward the  shooter and was yelling for people to get out of the way. He actually  proceeded to tackle the killer and fought him in an attempt to disarm  him, all while being shot at least five separate times. He was wounded,  but he, nevertheless, happened to make his way out to flag down first  responders and be able to give an accurate description of the shooter,  which ultimately allowed him to be neutralized.  Amn Mohammed Haitham's family moved to St. Petersburg from New  Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. His school's assistant principal  called him ``the Perfect One'' because he was a good student, a track  star, and basketball player. This is a quote from the assistant  principal:  [He] would walk into any room and it would light up. He had   this magnetic personality--big smile, always happy. And   people would always gravitate toward him.  His commanding officer told his father that it was his son Mohammed  who had also bravely attempted to take down the gunman and lost his  life.  Then there was Cameron Walters of Georgia, described as ``an amazing  guy, he always had something good to say to everybody, and was always  smiling.''  The morning of the shooting, Airman Walters was randomly assigned to  watch duty in Building 633. He had been stationed in Pensacola for only  2 weeks before this attack.  Again, I want to thank Senator Scott, my colleague of Florida, for  offering this. It ensures that not only will we not forget the heroes  who sacrificed their lives while protecting fellow Navy members as this  tragedy unfolded, but it also reminds us of the obligation we have to  get to the bottom of how this happened and why this happened so that it  may never, ever happen anywhere again.  I yield the floor.    "
