Tulsi Gabbard,0.5616512894630432,D," Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, finally, this is a historic moment that so  many here and across the country have been working toward, to take this  step to end America's destructive and costly war on drugs that has  turned everyday Americans into criminals and torn families apart,  ruining so many people's lives.  This legislation removes cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act,  frees States to regulate it as they choose, and encourages research  into the medicinal qualities of this plant that we all already know are  changing people's lives and saving people's lives. It also applies  retroactively, expunging prior convictions and records, freeing a  generation of people from the shackles of this failed war on drugs.  Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is this vote is about freedom. It is  freedom of choice for every American to make their own decisions for  themselves without fear of the government coming and arresting them.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. The Senate  should pass it quickly so we can send it to the President for his  signature.    "
