Ami Bera,0.9858531951904296,D," Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge support of my resolution,  ', H. Res. 1012, ', which recognizes the transformation of the U.S.-South  Korea relationship into a strong and enduring partnership that benefits  the entire world.  As the proud co-chair of the Korea Caucus and the co-chair of the  Congressional Study Group on Korea, I know how important this  relationship is to our two countries.  This spring, I introduced this resolution because I wanted to  acknowledge and highlight the shared history and ties between our  nations.  It was over 70 years ago that the United States rushed to the aid of  the Republic of Korea after they were attacked by its neighbor to the  north.  The United States, leading the multinational coalition of the United  Nations Command, successfully defended the Republic of Korea.  But the war devastated South Korea. Forty years ago, South Korea was  one of the poorest countries in the world. Today, they are one of the  most advanced. It is a miracle, and it is hard work.  The Republic of Korea became a democracy in the late 1980s. Today, it  is one of the most widely respected countries in Asia and the world. It  has been incredibly successful against the COVID-19 pandemic and has  helped the United States in our own battle against it.  President-elect Biden has recognized the value of our relationship  with Korea, and his call to President Moon Jae-in was one of the first  calls to a foreign leader.  Our ties with the Republic of Korea are enduring. They are based on  our shared people-to-people values, our vibrant Korean-American  community, American expatriates in South Korea, and our economic ties.  We have shared values and respect for democracy and human rights. We  will work together to confront the challenges of this pandemic, as well  as other challenges, like climate change.  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who support and  sustain this alliance, as well as Chairman Engel and Ranking Member  McCaul and their staff, like Theresa Lou, who helped bring this  resolution to the floor.
