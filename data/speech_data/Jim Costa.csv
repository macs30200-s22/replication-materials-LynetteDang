Jim Costa,0.0596408136188983,D," Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, I  recognize a Latino leader who has been an inspiration and a role model  to thousands of students in my home of Fresno, the San Joaquin Valley,  and that is Dr. Joe Castro, president of Fresno State University, home  of the Bulldogs.  Yesterday, Dr. Castro was named the newest chancellor of California  State University system after spending 8 years at my alma mater at  Fresno State with great success. He is the first native of California  and the first person of color to head the California University system,  the largest in the entire Nation.  Raised in an immigrant household in Hanford, California, he is the  first in his family, like so many, to graduate from college. His story  is the story of the American immigrant.  He serves as a mentor and an inspiration to thousands of first- generation college students who have followed in his footsteps, folks  like members of my family. His leadership led to many accolades for  Fresno State in recent years as the university continues to be one of  the best colleges in the country.  A passionate and fierce advocate for students, his selection to lead  the largest public university system in the country is a testament to  his leadership and the respect he has throughout the Nation as one of  the leaders in higher education. He will leave behind a legacy that was  best expressed when he first came to Fresno State and he told the  student body: ``Be bold.'' ``Be bold.''  Congratulations, Joe and Mary, a real team, a Bulldog team, and  always Bulldog proud.    "
