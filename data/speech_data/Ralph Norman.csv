Ralph Norman,0.3664720952510834,R," Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to come before you today to  celebrate National Bible Week. What better time to celebrate Bible Week  in what is called the people's House, but what is ultimately God's  house.  In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a national  proclamation to celebrate the impact of the Bible on our Nation, a  light for so many and a source of hope in the darkest of times.  The boundless influence of the Holy Bible on this Nation is  unmistakable.  In this Chamber, Moses, the messenger of the Ten Commandments, a  witness of God in all of his glory upon the mountaintop, watches over  this body from above the gallery doors each time we gather to conduct  business.  However, it is not merely the multitudes of honorary monuments and  portraits of Biblical figures and passages that exemplify the  importance of the Scriptures to all Americans, but it is the impression  on our social fabric that is so evident in our actions, which speaks  volumes.  This Nation was founded upon Judeo-Christian principles. A stroll  past any of the extraordinary monuments here in the Capitol makes that  abundantly evident. Our commitment to the fundamentals of the Word of  the Lord Jesus has sustained us throughout our rich history, during the  highest of times and during the lowest of times.  The profound impact of the Bible, and particularly the Gospels, led  me to serve in this great body. It is the words of the Son of God, to  ``love each other as I have loved you,'' which guides me. And I believe  that if we continue to turn to the Lord in all that we do, our best is  yet to come.  Despite our fierce philosophical differences and the imperfect nature  of legislation, God never fails us. An annual celebration of His  infallible Word and never-ending love, though not near enough, is the  perfect reminder for us to unite as a body with the shared goal of  humbly serving our creator faithfully and encouraging this Nation to do  the same.  God bless each and every one of you.    "
