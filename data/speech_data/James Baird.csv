James Baird,0.0397605448961257,R," Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor Linden, Indiana,  resident Dr. Mark Eutsler.  This year marks the 25th year that Dr. Eutsler has co-chaired the  nationally televised IPL 500 Festival Parade. Using his experience as  the former director of bands at McCutcheon High School, he has helped  over 45,000 students from 425 Indiana schools participate in the  nationally acclaimed IPL 500 Festival Parade.  Prior to his appointment as co-chair, Dr. Eutsler has served as an  enthusiastic supporter of the Indianapolis 500 Festival for decades.  Mark has attended the parade consistently since 1980 and has been a  volunteer for the event for 29 years.  Dr. Eutsler's consecutive years of service stand out among the more  than 3,000 volunteers who will fill roughly 7,000 positions for the  month-long May event every year.  Dr. Mark Eutsler is a pillar of the community. I express my deepest  thanks and appreciation for his passion and for the service he has  devoted to a program that defines Hoosier heritage.    "
