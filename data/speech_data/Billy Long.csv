Billy Long,0.3385578691959381,R," Mr. LONG. Mr. Speaker, the Seventh Congressional District of  Missouri's economy has a significant dependence on seasonal outdoor  amusement and entertainment including the Ozark Empire Fair, the  carnivals on the midways of county fairs, and the nation's favorite  vacation spot, Branson. These for profit and not for profit enterprises  employ thousands of Ozarkians, some year-round and the majority just in  the season.  Branson in the Missouri Ozarks draws about nine million visitors a  year, mainly during a nine-month season. From the world-famous Silver  Dollar City to the celebrated country music venues and all attractions  in between, including excellent bass fishing, world class golf, youth  baseball tournaments, and endless outdoor adventures, Branson is a  premier destination in America.  But these are not normal times.  Springfield, Missouri is home to the International Association of  Fairs and Expositions (IAFE).  Agricultural Fairs--county fairs, state fairs and regional ag shows-- are deeply rooted in our heritage and history, with the mission to  promote and advance agriculture, horticulture, domestic industry, with  a focused emphasis on youth leadership development through  competitions, education, and leadership opportunities.  Most fairs, a total of 2,092 in the US, also provide exceptional  educational activities to help today's Americans understand the  importance of farming and the source of the food on their plate.  Fairs cannot function without a complex arrangement of carnival  midway operations, food and beverage operations, livestock shows,  exhibits and demonstrations. With nearly 300 fairs happening across  America in July alone [["", Page , H1863, ] each year, it is impossible to reschedule a fair for a different time.  According to the IAFE, each year the operation of agricultural fairs  results in $4.67 billion for the US economy and provides thousands of  jobs.  Fairs and their carnival partners on the midway have been devastated  by the cancellation of events thus far. IAFE estimates a loss of  revenue exceeding $1.4 billion to the fair and festival core  organizations just for March through May.  The Outdoor Amusement Business Association (OABA) represents some 200  carnivals, 15 circuses and hundreds of traveling food/game  concessionaires in the United States. The vast majority of their  members are small, family businesses, many in their third or more  generation of ownership. The OABA estimates 350 carnival events have  currently been closed through May I. Based on historical attendance  data and this estimated performance cancellations, the lost revenue to  carnival operators is near $250 million.  Should the need for social distancing or total quarantine exist into  the summer, the economic devastation will inevitably put these  community organizations as well as many of the small businesses in the  allied sectors out of business. Thousands of jobs will be lost.  Because both the not-for-profit fair sector and the outdoor amusement  business segment are unique subsets of our economic and commercial  activities, we must ensure they are not excluded from any current or  new SBA programs and they are just as eligible for federal support from  the new $500 billion fund provided to the Treasury as any Wall Street  traded company.
