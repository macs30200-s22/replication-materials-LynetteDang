Henry Cuellar,1.2490119934082031,D," Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman DeFazio for his  leadership, his staff for working hard on this particular bill, and the  ranking member and his staff for doing this.  I want to talk about one project that got added, and that is the  Chacon Creek in Laredo, Texas. This is a project that we have been  working on for many years with the city of Laredo. Now, this will  provide the flood control, the work that we need to do, that starts off  from Lake Casa Blanca all the way to the Rio Grande, miles of area that  will provide not only for the environment but also for the quality of  life for Laredo.  I want to thank Chairman DeFazio so much for his great work, and we  appreciate him in Laredo, Texas.    "
