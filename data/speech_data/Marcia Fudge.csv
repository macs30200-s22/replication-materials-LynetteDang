Marcia Fudge,0.5473006963729858,D," Ms. FUDGE. Madam Speaker, on Friday, we lost an honorable and decent  woman, Justice Ginsburg, a person who changed the world.  But for all her successes, those who are bent on choosing her  successor have no decency. They have no honor. They have no integrity.  It is a shame that they did not learn the lessons of Justice Ginsburg,  which were decency and honesty and integrity, one who fought for  others.  All they want to do is fight for themselves. They want to take away  our healthcare. They don't want to help people who are in trouble. They  don't care about people who are unemployed. All they want to do is win.  But what do they win? What have they won for this Nation? They just  want to benefit themselves.  We are not here for ourselves. We are here for the people who sent us  here. We are here to represent the people.  When you lose sight of that, what a shame, what an absolute shame.  They are a disgrace to this Nation.    "
