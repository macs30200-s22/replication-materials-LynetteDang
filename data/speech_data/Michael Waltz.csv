Michael Waltz,0.2007088959217071,R," Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize someone very  special on my team, a real-life superwoman, a [[', Page , H7115, ] warrior, a hard worker, an Air Force lieutenant colonel, and--perhaps  her most important job--a mother of five. Her name is Amanda Naylor,  and she has been part of my office for her yearlong Defense fellowship.  Amanda took the hustle and bustle of Capitol Hill in stride. She made  it look easy. She hit the ground running, and whether it was committee  hearings, briefings with Defense Department officials, or working with  other offices, Amanda was always there to provide our team expertise  and drive issues forward.  She used her own experience in the military and the Air Force to  craft legislation like the Rent the Camo Act that provided affordable  maternity uniforms for our servicewomen. It is truly a testament to her  insight and her hard work that she got this bill into the NDAA, into  the defense bill. She is a perfect example of why we need more veterans  in Congress and more veterans in government at every level. They bring  that on-the-ground expertise into our legislation.  Amanda is talented, smart, and, above all, kind. Congress could  certainly use more like her. I am sad she will be leaving us, but she  has made our office and she will make the country a better and safer  place.    "
