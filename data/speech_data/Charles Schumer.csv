Charles Schumer,0.5495330095291138,D," Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, last night, the House of Representatives  voted to impeach President Donald Trump. It is only the third time in  our Nation's history that the President of the United States has been  impeached.  The articles of impeachment charge that President Trump abused the  powers of his office by soliciting the interference of a foreign power  in our elections, not for the good of the country but to benefit  himself personally. The articles also charge that the President  obstructed Congress in the investigation of those matters. Together,  these articles suggest the President committed a grave injury to our  grand democracy.  The conduct they describe is very much what the Founders feared when  they forged the impeachment powers of the Congress. The Founders, in  their wisdom, gave the House the power to accuse and the Senate the  power to judge. We are now asked to fulfill our constitutional role as  a court of impeachment.  Now that the House of Representatives has impeached President Trump,  the Nation turns its eyes to the Senate. What will the Nation see? Will  the Nation see what Alexander Hamilton saw--a body of government with  ``confidence enough . . . to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the  necessary impartiality,'' or will the Nation see the Senate dragged  into the depths of partisan fervor?  The Nation just witnessed how the Republican leader sees his role in  this chapter of our history--demonstrating both an unfortunate descent  into partisanship and demonstrating the fundamental weakness of the  President's defense.  Leader McConnell claimed that the impeachment of President Trump is  illegitimate because the House voted along party lines. Forgive me, but  House Democrats cannot be held responsible for the cravenness of the  House Republican caucus and their blind fealty to the President.  Leader McConnell claimed that the impeachment was motivated by  partisan rage--this from the man who said proudly, ``I am not  impartial. I have no intention to be impartial at all'' in the trial of  President Trump. What hypocrisy.  Leader McConnell accused the House Democrats of an obsession to get  rid of President Trump--this from the man who proudly declared his  ``number one goal'' was to make President Obama a one-term President.  Leader McConnell claimed that Democrats impeached the President for  asserting Executive privilege. President Trump never formally claimed  Executive privilege; he claimed ``absolute immunity,'' and the White  House Counsel wrote a letter stating simply that the administration  would not comply with any subpoenas.  Leader McConnell claimed that the Democrats' ``obsession'' with  impeachment has prevented the House from pursuing legislation to help  the American people. Leader McConnell knows very, very well that the  House Democratic majority has passed literally hundreds of bills that  gather dust here in the Senate, condemned to a legislative graveyard by  none other than Leader McConnell himself, who proudly called himself  the Grim Reaper.  Members of the 116th Senate have been denied the opportunity to  legislate by Leader McConnell. We aren't even allowed to debate the  issues that would impact the American people: healthcare,  infrastructure, prescription drugs. We could have spent the year  debating these issues. We weren't doing impeachment. Leader McConnell  has chosen not to focus on these issues and to put none of these bills  on the floor. As he reminds us often, he alone decides what goes on the  floor. [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7171"">Page S7171</a>, ]  Leader McConnell claimed that the House did not afford the President  due process. The leader knows well that President Trump refused to  participate in the process, despite invitation, and blocked witnesses  and documents from Congress in unprecedented fashion.  Leader McConnell claimed that the House ran the ``most rushed, least  thorough, and most unfair impeachment inquiry in modern history.'' I  know that is the Republican talking point, but here is the reality:  Leader McConnell is plotting the most rushed, least thorough, and most  unfair impeachment trial in modern history. His plan to prevent House  managers from calling witnesses to prove their case is a dramatic break  from precedent.  We heard a lot about precedent from the leader. Never has there been  a Presidential impeachment trial in which the majority prevented the  House managers from fairly presenting their case, to have witnesses  explain their knowledge of the alleged malfeasance. Will Leader  McConnell, breaking precedent, strong-arm his caucus into making this  the first Senate impeachment trial of a President in history that heard  no witnesses?  We ask: Is the President's case so weak that none of the President's  men can defend him under oath? Is the President's case so weak that  none of the President's men can defend him under oath? If the House  case is so weak, why is Leader McConnell so afraid of witnesses and  documents? We believe the House case is strong, very strong, but if the  Republican leader believes it is so weak, why is he so afraid of  relevant witnesses and documents, which will not prolong things very  long in our proposal--four hours for each witness?  It is true, as the leader has said, that the Framers built the Senate  to provide stability and to keep partisan passions from boiling over.  However, their vision of the Senate is a far cry from the partisan body  Senator McConnell has created.  I hope America was watching the Republican leader deliver his speech.  I really do, because most glaring of all was the fact that Leader  McConnell's 30-minute partisan stem-winder contained hardly a single  defense of the President of the United States on the merits. Almost  none have defended President Trump because they can't.  In the wake of an enormous amount of evidence uncovered by House  investigators--much of it in the form of testimony by top Trump  officials whom the administration tried to silence--the Republican  leader could not rebut the accusations against the President with  facts. The Republican leader complained about the process. The  Republican leader made very partisan and inflammatory accusations about  Democrats, but he did not advance an argument in defense of the  President's conduct on the merits. That, in and of itself, is a damning  reflection on the state of the President's defense.  Our goal in the Senate, above all, should be to conduct a fair and  speedy trial. I have proposed a very reasonable structure that would do  just that: four witnesses, only those with direct knowledge of the  charges made by the House; only those who could provide new, relevant  and potentially illumination testimony; strict time limits on each  stage of the process to prevent the trial from dragging out too long.  It is eminently reasonable; it is eminently fair. A group with no  partisan bias would come up with this type of proposal.  I have yet to hear one good argument as to why less evidence is  better than more evidence, particularly in such a serious moment as  impeachment of the President of the United States. In Leader  McConnell's 30-minute screed, he did not make one argument as to why  witnesses and documents should not be a part of the trial.  President Trump protests that he did not receive due process in the  House impeachment inquiry. Due process is the ability to respond to  charges made against you and present your side of the case. The  President was invited to provide witnesses and provide documents at  every stage of the process. He chose not to.  Still, Democrats are offering the President due process again here in  the Senate. The witnesses we suggest are top Trump-appointed officials.  They aren't Democrats. We don't know if their testimony would exculpate  the President or incriminate him, but their testimony should be heard.  If the President's counsel wants to call other witnesses with direct  knowledge of why the aid to Ukraine was delayed, we say that they  should be able to do so. President Trump claims he wants due process. I  suspect he would rather hide or name-call because if he really wanted  due process, he could get it easily. One phone call to Leader McConnell  telling him to let his aides testify, one phone call to his chief of  staff telling him to release the documents to Congress--both of these  actions would let the truth come out. I ask again: Can none of the  President's men come defend him under oath?  To my Republican colleagues, our message is a simple one. Democrats  want a fair trial that examines the relevant facts. We want a fair  trial. The message from Leader McConnell at the moment is that he has  no intention of conducting a fair trial, no intention of acting  impartially, no intention of getting the facts.  Despite our disagreements, I will meet with Leader McConnell soon to  discuss the rules, but each Senator will influence whether the Senate  lives up to its constitutional duty to serve as an impartial court of  impeachment. In the coming weeks, Republican senators will face a  choice. Each Republican Senator will face a choice. Do they want a fair  trial or do they want to allow the President free rein? Each Senator  must ask himself or herself: Do you want a fair trial or do you want  the President to do whatever he wants, regardless of the rule of law,  regardless of the consequences to this great Nation?  The Nation turns its eyes to the Senate. What will it see?  The President of the United States has spent the past several months  telling Congress that it has no right to oversight and no right to  investigate any of his activities; that he has absolute immunity; that  article II of the Constitution gives him the ``right to do whatever he  wants.'' Those are the President's words. Past Senates have disagreed  with such views and strongly, proudly stood up for the notion that the  President is not omnipotent. Democrats have done it; Republicans have  done it--and often Presidents of their own party.  The Senate has said in the past that the President serves the people,  not himself; that he is not a King. Will it do so again or will it  shirk from that responsibility?  If the Republicans lead with the majority leader's scheme to sweep  these charges under the rug and permit the President to ignore  Congress, they will be creating a new precedent that will long be  remembered as one of the Senate's darkest chapters. It will be  remembered as a time when a simple majority in the Senate sought to  grant two new rights to the President: the right to use the government  for personal purposes and the right to ignore Congress at his pleasure.  Here I agree with Senator McConnell: ``Moments like this are why the  Senate exists.'' If the President commits high crimes and misdemeanors  and the Congress can do nothing about it, not even conduct a fair  tribunal where his conduct is judged by dispassionate representatives  of the people, then the President can commit those crimes with  impunity. This President can; others can.  I have little doubt that if we tell the President that he can escape  scrutiny in this instance, he will do it again and again and again.  Future Presidents will take note and may do worse. The most powerful  check on the Executive, the one designed to protect the people from  tyranny, will be erased.  This chapter in our history books could be a lesson about the erosion  of checks and balances in our modern age or it could be a proud  reaffirmation of those founding principles. This chapter in our history  books could be about the overpowering partisanship of our times or it  could be about the Senate's capacity to overcome it. Again, moments  like this are why the U.S. Senate exists.  I yield the floor.    "
