Christopher Jacobs,0.0198802724480628,R," Mr. JACOBS. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Water Resources  Development Act, which is critical to districts with significant  shorelines, like mine.  I am especially pleased to see the Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency  Study included in this bill. High water levels on Lake Erie, and  especially on Lake Ontario, are a major concern to communities in our  region. Homeowners and business owners along Lake Ontario have suffered  significant flooding and devastating property damage over the last few  years. This study will inform those projects and policies that will  mitigate high water levels and, hopefully, prevent future flooding of  the kind suffered recently.  I would also like to thank our leaders in the House, Ranking Member  Sam Graves and Chairman Peter DeFazio, for the bipartisan work they  have done on this legislation. The bipartisan work in the committee on  WRDA is always welcome and a strong example of the way business can be  conducted here.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of "", S. 1811, '. [[', Page , H6983, ]    {time} 1430    "
