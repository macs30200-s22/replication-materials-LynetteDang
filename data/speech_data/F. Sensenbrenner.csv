F. Sensenbrenner,0.1689823120832443,R," Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the  No BAN Act.  This bill is being framed as a ``religious freedom'' initiative. I  have fought for religious freedom throughout my career. I know what  religious freedom means. This bill is not about religious freedom. It  is about scoring cheap political points against President Trump.  The President is granted broad authority to take quick action to  limit the entry of foreign nationals into the United States. This is  needed for a variety of reasons, including national security and public  health. Whether it is addressing shortcomings in a certain country's  vetting and information sharing or limiting the potential influx of  coronavirus cases, we entrust the Executive Branch to keep America  safe.  President Trump's actions have been mislabeled as a ``Muslim Ban.''  But that is not the case. There is no religious test anywhere in the  President's travel restrictions. North Korea, an essentially religious- less society, is one of the countries included. Myanmar, another  country affected, is more than 80 percent Buddhist. Indonesia, which  was not included in the covered travel restrictions, has the largest  percentage of the world's Muslim population at over 12 percent.  Rather than try to paint with a broad brush, we should look at the  causes of these travel restrictions. Eritrea--Does not comply with the  established identity-management and information-sharing criteria.  Kyrgyzstan--Does not comply with the established identity-management  and information-sharing criteria. Nigeria--Does not comply with the  established identity-management and information-sharing criteria. And  so on.  This isn't about religious freedom. It is only about convincing  people it is.  In addition to the deficiencies of the underlying policy, the  Majority has made a mistake in including the Senate version of  pharmaceutical legislation as its pay-for.  Last year, the House Judiciary Committee worked on a bipartisan basis  to advance two important bills. One to reduce the burdens of patent  litigation when a company seeks to bring a complicated biosimilar drug  to market. And another to create a new antitrust authority to prevent  companies from playing games that could artificially suppress generic  competition.  Chairmen Jerrold Nadler and David Cicilline were great partners to me  and then-Hanking Member Doug Collins in that effort. It was refreshing  during a time of increasingly partisan hostility to work together in a  thoughtful manner to address drug pricing in the country.  Unfortunately, rather than take up that bill, the Majority has simply  ignored our weeks of careful negotiation and has chosen instead to  blindly attach the Senate language.  The shortcomings of this version of the legislation were already  addressed in committee. The text included in the No BAN Act gives the  FTC the authority to find a company liable even if all they do is  introduce an improved version of a product and then make truthful and  non-misleading statements about the new product. This will undoubtedly  stifle innovation. Why would any company invest the necessary research  dollars to introduce a new product, if they can be held liable for  truthful marketing of that product? In Committee, we fixed that.  The bill we're voting on today is also out of step with current  antitrust law. It would completely change the remedy and enforcement  authority under traditional antitrust law, and for no obvious reason,  apply those changes exclusively to just one industry. In Committee, we  fixed that.  I find it troubling that the Majority is choosing to abandon the good  faith negotiations and bipartisan work. The gentlemen from New York and  Rhode Island worked with the Minority to come up with a good product  that addresses drug pricing through regular order. The committee  process works. We should be voting on the legislation that passed the  Judiciary Committee by a voice vote. Not this version.  I oppose this legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.  Pursuant to "", House Resolution 891, ', the previous question is ordered on  this portion of the divided question.  The question is: Will the House concur in the Senate amendment with  the House amendment specified in section 4(a) of ', House Resolution 891, '?  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    "
