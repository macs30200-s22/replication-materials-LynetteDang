Robert Latta,0.959251880645752,R," Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, again, it has been a tremendous run with all  the work that you have done. You have been a gentleman and a good  friend.  Something I learned from my dad from his 36 years in public service,  and I will say it again on this floor. He said there is a difference  between people who are politicians and public servants. He said a  politician is a person who sees how much they can take from the people  they represent for their own benefit, while a public servant sees how  much they can give of themselves back to the people they represent.  For what you have done for not only your constituents of your great  State but also here in this body, we are going to miss you.  So, Greg, and that is the first time I have ever used a first name on  this floor, we are going to miss you. I am going to miss you, but we  wish you all the best in the years to come.    "
