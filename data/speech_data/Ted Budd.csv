Ted Budd,0.5275022983551025,R," Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the frustrated and,  frankly, exhausted small business job-creators in my district and  across the Nation who are struggling to survive while the Speaker  continues to play politics with people's livelihoods.  While many States and localities begin to make the same mistake of  instituting massive shutdowns, small businesses have been left high and  dry. [["", Page , H6916, ]  Imagine pouring everything you have emotionally and financially into  an idea; then you watch it grow and thrive, but, through no fault of  your own, it gets ruined because your local government shuts you down  and the Federal Government refuses to help.  The Speaker can solve this problem today by allowing a vote to  unleash over $130 billion in already-appropriated leftover PPP funding.  In addition, the House should immediately consider the Small Business  Expense Protection Act, which was introduced by my friend and fellow  North Carolinian, George Holding. That bill would clarify the confusion  at the IRS and make sure that recipients can deduct PPP-financed  expenses on their taxes.  Mr. Speaker, for the sake of our Nation's job creators and for the  sake of our workers, it is time that we act to support our fellow  citizens as we enter the final stages of our battle against this virus.
