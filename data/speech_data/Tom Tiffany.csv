Tom Tiffany,0.0099401362240314,R," Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I want to follow up on the comments from  the Congressman from the First District of Michigan.  Today, I recognize a good friend and great American, Tom Casperson,  who passed away this weekend. Tom lived in Representative Bergman's  district in Escanaba, Michigan.  I knew Tom as a State senator when he worked on numerous issues  across State lines with me. The Good Neighbor Authority promoting  better management of our national forests originated at a hearing Tom  and I put together in Breitung Township, Michigan. Tom Casperson may  have had a greater impact on Upper Peninsula issues in the Michigan  Legislature than anyone who served the Upper Peninsula.  While I knew Tom as a State senator, he will be remembered for far  more than that, including as a man of great faith.  Mr. Speaker, I send my deepest sympathies to Tom's wife, Diane, and  their family.  It has been a great privilege to have known such a fine man. May Tom  Casperson rest in peace.    "
