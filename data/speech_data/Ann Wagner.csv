Ann Wagner,0.928634762763977,R," Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the tremendous  service of a leader in Missouri agriculture, Mr. Blake Hurst.  Starting out as a young farmer in northwest Missouri, Blake rose  through the ranks of the Missouri Farm Bureau to become a statewide  board member, vice president, and, finally, president in 2010. Over his  tenure, Blake brought the organization to new heights and developed a  national reputation for his expertise in agriculture policy.  After decades of service, Blake plans to retire this year and spend  more time on his farm with his loving wife, Julie, and their beautiful  family.  Madam Speaker, I thank Blake for his unwavering support for Missouri  farmers and wish him the very best as he begins this new chapter in his  life.    "
