Kim Schrier,0.6795381307601929,D," Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, the people in my district continue to  struggle with the economic effects of COVID-19. My constituents and  small business owners will be so relieved to know that help that they  need is one step closer to being here, including more assistance to  small businesses, funding for childcare and education, enhanced  unemployment benefits, and rental assistance.  Several of my bills to help children and families have been included  in this package as well, including increasing funding for child abuse  prevention and more help fighting hunger and boosting access to fresh  fruits and vegetables.  Finally, as a doctor, I am very happy that my legislation to improve  education about vaccines, including a future or many future COVID-19  vaccines, is in this package. It is important that the American people  feel confident that whatever vaccine does get approval, it is truly  safe and effective, and that education begins now.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    "
