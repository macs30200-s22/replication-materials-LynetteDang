Randy Weber,0.0695809498429298,R," Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we have taken the Bible and God out  of school. We are so smart. We have replaced Him with armed police  officers, drug-sniffing dogs, and metal detectors.  We have kicked Biblical training and principles out of schools. And  now, we have broken families, absentee fathers, single moms struggling,  and disrespect like we have never seen before.  So much for what Jesus teaches us in the Bible: Love others as you  love yourself. Or do unto others as you would have them do unto you, a/ k/a, the Golden Rule.  Today's moral-less culture's motto seems to be, do unto others and  then split, but not before you get a selfie and put it on Facebook.  Disrespect is rampant--witnessing the rioting in the cities recently,  the burning of the American flag. The courts decided in their infinite  wisdom that flag burning is a protected form of speech. All I ask of  those who are going to burn the flag, wrap themselves in it first.  Mr. Speaker, courts have decided that you can't pray in schools, you  can't pray at football games. We wouldn't want to invoke God's  blessings on our gatherings. So much for the commandments in the Bible:  Love, respect, duty, commitment, et cetera.  Our country has gotten away from Biblical principles. Marriages have  been destroyed, drugs are rampant, killing of unborn children. So much  the order of the day, that now the abortion crowd wants to kill people  after they have botched an abortion. [["", Page , H7096, ]  Mr. Speaker, think of it. America's great fighting men and women can  be fighting a vile enemy; we can wing one of their soldiers and we will  do everything we can to nurse that soldier back to health, that enemy.  But we won't try to save a baby we just tried to abort.  God, help us. Lord, help us if we don't get back to Biblical  principles. It is God's guidebook, his plan that this country was  founded on. America, you had better get back to the Bible.    "
