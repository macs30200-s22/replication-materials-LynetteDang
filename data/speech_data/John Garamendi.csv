John Garamendi,0.6334449648857117,D," Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the final  ``Water Resources Development Act of 2020'' ("", S. 1811, ""). Working with  other members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I  am very pleased to reach agreement with the Senate on a truly  bipartisan bill and the fourth biennial Water Resources Development Act  (WRDA) to be passed by Congress since 2014.  My Congressional district includes 200 miles of the Sacramento River  and is adjacent to several major ports. WRDA 2020 includes key  provisions for the California Delta and Central Valley to authorize and  expedite construction of flood protection and aquatic ecosystem  restoration projects, address harmful algal blooms, and give local  agencies greater flexibility in using federal Army Corps funds to  better meet local needs. Under Chairman DeFazio's leadership, the bill  finally fixes the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund to ensure that regional  dredging and navigation projects are fully funded.  I secured Congressional authorization for the Delta Islands and  Levees Ecosystem Restoration Project, Yuba River Ecosystem Restoration  Project, and Sacramento Regional Groundwater Bank in WRDA 2020. These  projects provide critical flood protection and make local communities  across the Central Valley more resilient to climate change.  I also secured deauthorization of the Sacramento Riverbed Gradient  Restoration Facility and Western Pacific Interceptor Canal, returning  these former Army Corps projects to full local control.  WRDA 2020 also expedites completion of the Army Corps' feasibility  studies needed for the San Francisco Bay to Stockton Navigation  Improvement Project, Lower Cache Creek Flood Risk Management Project,  and Sutter Bypass and Sacramento River Basin Floodplain Management  Project. I look forward to securing Congressional authorization for  these projects once the Army Corps completes the requisite feasibility  studies.  Working with Rep. Doris O. Matsui (CA-06), I secured inclusion of our  ``Yolo Bypass System Improvement Act'' in WRDA 2020 to improve  coordinated planning for all restoration projects and federal  permitting in the Yolo Bypass.  Lastly, I am very pleased that the new Army Corps harmful algal bloom  program established under WRDA 2020 includes the California Delta as a  focus area. This will better protect the Delta's precious ecosystem  from toxic algal blooms.  The House report for WRDA 2020 includes my amendment directing the  Army Corps to report to Congress on implementation of the Small  Business Act across all the Corps' missions. This strengthens  Congressional oversight over the Corps' contracting process and ensures  that the Small Business Act is implemented fully in an equitably  distributed manner, as intended by Congress.  I want to extend a special appreciation to my colleague Rep. Grace F.  Napolitano (CA-32), chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Water Resources  and Environment, for her tireless work in this WRDA for the entire  California delegation. WRDA 2020 ensures that Army Corps projects in  California requiring earthquake-resistance and other seismic safety  costs remain equally competitive for federal funding compared to  projects in other states.  I urge all Members of Congress to support this bipartisan WRDA 2020,  which is expected to be signed into law this year. This two-year  authorization bill provides the federal support and certainty needed to  keep Army Corps projects across California on time and on budget.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, "", S. 1811, "", as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to provide  for improvements to the rivers and harbors of the United States, to  provide for the conservation and development of water and related  resources, and for other purposes.''.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
