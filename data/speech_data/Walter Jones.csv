Walter Jones,0.0218682996928691,R," Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I want to first thank Senator Inhofe and  Senator Reed and their staff for their amazing work on this National  Defense Authorization Act. What we are about to accomplish is truly  remarkable, not only for America but for individuals and families.  I am rising today as grateful and as humbled as I could ever imagine  being in this Senate Chamber, but I am also just the opposite--I am  excited like a kid at Christmas waiting to have the final passage of  this because it means so much. We are at the finish line, about to run  through the tape in a race, a marathon that so many folks thought we  could never finish. I am talking about this momentous and historic  National Defense Authorization Act upon which we are about to vote and  pass in just a few moments.  The NDAA includes so many of our collective priorities to bolster the  defense of our Nation, to modernize our military, and to take care of  our servicemembers and their families. But included very deep within  this incredibly thick piece of legislation is a provision that has been  repeatedly introduced over the past 18 years, but it has never gotten  across that finish line. I am speaking about the Military Widow's Tax  Elimination Act.  For the past four decades, the military widow's tax has prevented  surviving military spouses from receiving the full benefits they are  owed by the U.S. Government. Legislation to repeal this unfair law has  been repeatedly introduced in Congress for the last 18 years, but money  and budgets and points of order have always won out over the commitment  we have made to these families. [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7068"">Page S7068</a>, ]  When I introduced it with my friend and colleague Senator Collins  earlier this year, we knew it was going to be an uphill battle. We knew  that the fight had been going on for so long and that we faced a steep  climb, but we took a great deal of strength and motivation from the  impacted widows themselves who have fought and advocated for this bill  for nearly two decades. They have been a regular presence on Capitol  Hill, asking year after year for Members of Congress to lend an ear to  their cause. I was heartbroken when one of them told me they felt like  they were easy to brush off because they were ``just a bunch of little  old ladies.''  I was heartbroken when Cathy Milford said every time she came up here  it was like digging up her husband and burying him all over again.  After 18 years without success, yet all the while being told how  supportive Members of Congress are for their service and sacrifice,  time and time again, you could see how disheartening that might be when  they would go home emptyhanded.  So when I told them this was the year--Senator Collins and I had made  it our mission that this was going to be the year we were finally going  to get this done--there were more than a few of them who were  skeptical, but they were, of course, always optimistic.  We knew we had to fight harder than ever before if we were going to  be successful. We had to make our case that this injustice could no  longer stand. As we did, one by one, Senators and Members of the House  joined this cause with us. By summertime, in this body, we had earned  an unprecedented number of Senators' support for this bill.  Today, as we are about to vote, there are over three-fourths of the  U.S. Senate who have cosponsored this legislation. Think of that. In  such a partisan time as we live in right now, in this moment, three- fourths of the U.S. Senate has voiced their support.  Because of the momentum we built, this is the year, this is the day,  we will finally honor the commitment we made to these families who have  given everything to our country. This is the year, this is the day, we  will let our actions speak louder than words, the year we finally put  our money where our mouth is when it comes to honoring our  servicemembers and their families. This is the year, this is the day,  we finally repeal the widow's tax once and for all.  It is, to be candid, difficult to articulate what it means to me to  be able to help bring this legislation across the finish line for these  surviving spouses.  Their strength, their devotion, and their grit have made this all  possible. Their loved ones gave what Abraham Lincoln called ``the last  full measure of devotion'' to our country, and the continued commitment  to that devotion by their surviving spouses is a daily reminder of why  I am here, why we are all here.  In their own way, these widows have also fought to advance the ideals  and values of the Nation we all love so much. Instead of becoming  bitter or jaded when learning of this injustice, these incredible women  worked to make things right. Year after year, they would gather in  Washington to meet with Members of the House and the Senate to beg  Congress to right this wrong, only to be told that as unfair as this  may be, eliminating the widow's tax would just cost us too much. For 18  years, they were told it could never get done, but they never ever gave  up.  It kind of reminds me of a movie that was one of my favorite movies  years ago called ``Network,'' in which the late actor Peter Finch  starred as a somewhat crazed newscaster who was so fed up with the  state of affairs in this country that he implored all those watching to  go to their windows and throw open the windows and just yell: ``I'm mad  as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore,'' and they did.  That is essentially what these widows did as well. Year after year,  they screamed that they were not going to take it anymore, and they  built momentum that led to this historic vote today.  I am so glad this fight is finally coming to an end. I am going to  miss their regular visits and their friendship. I truly hope they know  how much it has meant to me and my staff as well. My staff has been all  in. Everybody has been so dedicated and so passionate about getting  this across the finish line.  I am deeply grateful to Senators Inhofe and Reed, who have been  critical to this effort to get this done. Without them, it would not  have been possible. For their support, I am truly appreciative.  More important, I am especially grateful to my partner in all of  this, Senator Collins, whose deeply held commitment was vital to our  success.  Today we will celebrate the end to our four-decades-old fight. We  will take stock in this great achievement together, but tomorrow we  must turn our attention to the next big issue because there are so many  others who need our help, our attention, and our courage to do the  right thing.  For now--for now we can celebrate because today those military  spouses who had once proclaimed they were mad as hell and not going to  take it are watching this proceeding with a more joyous feeling. These  widows are watching in the quiet of their homes, perhaps in the  Gallery, many of them grasping a photograph of their loved ones, their  late husbands, but they all have tears in their eyes, saying to each  other and to us in this body: Thank you because now I am happy as hell  that I don't have to take it anymore.  I assure my colleagues that right now their spouses, those who gave  the ultimate sacrifice for this country, are watching from that  heavenly perch above, standing at full attention, and saluting the  Members of this Congress and saying: Thank you. Thank you for  recognizing the ultimate sacrifice I made for this country. Thank you  because you have demonstrated a commitment to me and my service, and  with that final commitment from you, the commitment I made to my loved  ones, the commitment to care for them even after I am gone, has finally  been fulfilled, and I can truly rest in peace.  To my colleagues in the Senate, by your vote today, you are doing so  much more than modernizing our military providing for the Nation's  defense. By your vote today, you are returning their salute--the salute  to those brave servicemembers who gave their all in service to this  country.  Folks, this is a really, really big deal, and I salute all the  Members of this body for their efforts.  I yield the floor.    "
