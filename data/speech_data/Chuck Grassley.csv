Chuck Grassley,2.2142789363861084,R," Mr. GRASSLEY. I do agree. The IRS got the law correct when it issued  Revenue Ruling 2018-2, and our clarification makes clear that it is our  intent for the IRS interpretation of the law to be controlling for all  claims. This is the basis of the ``no inference'' language in the bill  that states: ``Nothing contained in this subsection or the amendments  made by this subsection shall be construed to create any inference as  to a change in law or guidance in effect prior to enactment of this  subsection.''  I thank the ranking member for engaging in this colloquy to discuss  this important issue and the clarification included in the pending  appropriations bill.    "
