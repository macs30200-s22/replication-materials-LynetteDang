Tom Udall,1.4404200315475464,D," Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, Werner Gellert survived the Holocaust and never forgot that terrible injustice. Werner went on to found a museum in Albuquerque dedicated not only to educating people about the Holocaust but dedicated to stopping intolerance wherever it is found. Werner Gellert was born on June 14, 1926 in Breslau, Germany. During November 9 and 10, 1938, Nazi paramilitary forces carried out a pogrom throughout Germany demolishing and ransacking Jewish homes, businesses, synagogues, schools, and hospitals. At that time, 267 synagogues in Germany and surrounding areas and 7,000 Jewish businesses were destroyed and over 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and incarcerated in concentration camps. That pogrom was called Night of the Broken Glass, or Kristallnacht, meaning ``Crystal Night,'' because of all the broken glass scattered throughout the streets from the shattered windows of Jewish buildings. After the Night of the Broken Glass, Werner and his adopted parents fled Germany for Shanghai, one of the only places in the world at that time that accepted Jews unconditionally. However, the Japanese who were occupying Shanghai became allied with the Germans, and, on February 18, 1943, they issued a proclamation establishing a restricted area where ``stateless refugees'' must live and work. Werner and his family were relocated to this restricted area, Hongkew, which became plagued with disease and starvation. On one of his birthdays, Werner asked only for a loaf of bread and jar of jam for himself, but he didn't get his wish. During this period, he suffered through starvation, typhus, yellow fever, and hepatitis, and he was brutalized by a bully and permanently lost most of the sight in one of his eyes. After the end of World War II, Werner remained in Shanghai, working as a typewriter repairman for the U.S. Army. The Army recognized his intelligence and linguistic skills--he spoke seven languages--and recruited him into Army intelligence as a civilian consultant. He worked undercover for the United States in China, Tibet, and the Philippines. The Chinese Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and early 1970s drove out Werner and his family, and they fortunately were able to escape on the last boat out of Shanghai to the United States. They relocated to Denver, where Werner attended Denver University and met his future wife, Frances Silverman--known as ``Frankie''--to whom he was married for 54 years, until her passing in 2007. After a successful career in the savings and loan business in California, Werner and Frankie retired to Albuquerque. Werner fervently believed that education was the most effective weapon against hate and intolerance. With that guiding principal in mind, in 2001, he and Frankie founded the Albuquerque Holocaust and Intolerance Museum. The museum is dedicated to educating the public through its exhibitions on the horrors and injustices of hate--from the Holocaust, to the African-American experience here in the United States to genocide of minority peoples around the world. Its goal is to promote ``upstanders,'' not bystanders: people who speak out and act to support individuals, groups, or causes attacked or bullied. The museum is home to the Library of Remembrance, a compilation of more than 4,500 books, documents, and videos about the injustice of genocide, bullying, and intolerance. As long as he was able, well into his eighties, Werner spoke to school groups at the museum and around the State teaching them about his experience during the Holocaust and as a refugee in Shanghai. Werner took his own terrible experience and set about to make a better, more understanding, more tolerant world for others. While we lost Werner on November 9, 2019, at age 93, [[<a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7206"">Page S7206</a>]] his commitment to ending genocide, intolerance, and bullying will live on through the Albuquerque Holocaust and Intolerance Museum.<bullet>   "
