Jennifer Wexton,2.1147994995117188,D," Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, COVID cases in my district are doubling,  tripling, or worse. From the D.C. suburbs to the rural areas, no part  is immune.  What is it going to take to burst the bubble our Senate colleagues  are living in and wake them up to reality? Because in this reality, 12  million Americans are going to lose their unemployment benefits next  month if we don't act. In this reality, tens of thousands of small  businesses are on track to close their doors for good by the end of the  winter.  If our Senate colleagues continue to sit on their hands and continue  to do nothing, then on top of a public health crisis and an economic  crisis, we are also going to have a homelessness crisis as eviction and  foreclosure moratoriums expire.  Mr. Speaker, I am urging leaders of both parties in both Chambers of  Congress to come together, and let's vote [["", Page , H5993, ] on something we can agree on. Let's extend the deadline for CARES Act  funds to be used by States and localities. Let's continue the eviction  moratorium, student loan relief, and unemployment benefits that have  been a lifeline for millions of workers.  Let's do the work our constituents sent us here to do and help the  American families and small businesses who are hurting. We owe it to  the millions of people who need our help.    "
