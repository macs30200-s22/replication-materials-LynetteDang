Tammy Duckworth,1.5297290086746216,D," Ms. DUCKWORTH. Madam President, I rise today to recognize my  colleague and friend, Senator Johnny Isakson, for a lifetime of service  to our Nation that started with his time as a loadmaster in the Georgia  Air National Guard, to his tenure in the Georgia General Assembly, to  his years of public service in the U.S. House of Representatives and  the U.S. Senate.  With Johnny's retirement, the Senate is losing a truly great leader;  a man of courage, whose dedication to this country has inspired me more  times than I can count; a man of honor, who has worked tirelessly for  the veteran community; and a man of compassion, who I am so grateful to  be able to call a dear friend.  We will never be able to fully thank Johnny for all he has done for  the rest of us, but today, I want to try. Johnny, thank you for being  there for me at Walter Reed when I was a Wounded Warrior, just home  from combat. Thank you for being by my side last spring, a decade and a  half later, on my first trip back to Iraq.  Thank you for always being there when it matters the most, for being  such an incredible advocate for our veterans, for giving the absolute  best birthday and holiday presents, and for showing what it means to  lead a life guided by integrity, a life defined by service.  You have made our Nation stronger and our Union more perfect. You  will be missed every time this Chamber is gaveled into session.    "
