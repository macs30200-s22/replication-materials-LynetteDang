John Boozman,0.2570700049400329,R," Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of  Fayetteville, AR, Police Officer Stephen Carr, who made the ultimate  sacrifice in the line of duty on Saturday, December 7.  Officer Carr was sitting in his patrol car in the parking lot behind  the police station when he was shot and killed. The 27-year-old had  been a member of the Fayetteville Police Department for 2\\1/2\\ years  and was assigned as a patrol officer in the Dickson Street  entertainment area.  In that short time with the police department, he demonstrated his  professionalism and duty to upholding the rule of law. The Fayetteville  police chief described Carr as an exemplary officer who was an all- American boy. The chief said at a press conference over the weekend:  ``If I had 131 Stephen Carr's, I wouldn't be more ecstatic.''  Carr grew up in a law enforcement family. He witnessed the  dedication, service, and commitment to protecting the community by  people he loved. His friends described him as a strong and kind person,  whose lifelong dream was to serve as a police officer.  He loved spending time outdoors hunting and fishing. A graduate from  The Woodlands High School in The Woodlands, TX, Carr played football  and earned recognition as an all-district offensive lineman. He went on  to play football at Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, MO, and  his former coach described him as a young man who made a big impact on  campus.  We rely on law enforcement officers to keep us safe. Each day they  put on their uniform, knowing the risks that come with public duty to  serve and to protect. Officer Carr's death is a reminder of the dangers  these first responders face daily and how quickly a situation can go  from ordinary to deadly, which is why those willing to take on this  role deserve both our gratitude and our respect.  The outpouring of support from the Fayetteville community has been a  tremendous strength to the police department as they mourn the loss of  a brother in blue. I pray they we will find comfort from this  encouragement during this very, very difficult time.  My thoughts and prayers go out to Officer Carr's family and friends.  I also stand with all Arkansans in expressing our gratitude for Officer  Carr's service and commitment to honoring the sacrifice that he and  others have made to protect us. We will forever remember him as a true  American hero.  With that, I yield the floor.    "
