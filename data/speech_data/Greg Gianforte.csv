Greg Gianforte,1.1362662315368652,R," Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark National Suicide  Awareness Month.  Unfortunately, Montanans are all too familiar with the epidemic of  suicide. As we have faced this ongoing public health and economic  crisis, the demand for mental health services has grown.  In Gallatin County, my home, crisis response therapists have  experienced a higher volume of calls. Each month they receive more  calls than the last from people needing help. Centers throughout  Montana are seeing similar increases.  To confront the greater demand for services and to help people in  crisis, we must ensure access to necessary resources are available. One  crucial resource is the national suicide hotline.  I am grateful to my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, for  working with me to designate 988 as the hotline's number. I am proud of  that bipartisan accomplishment.  Let's continue to provide these critical resources for those who need  them the most and support them through their darkest hours.    "
