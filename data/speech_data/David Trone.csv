David Trone,1.087242603302002,D," Mr. TRONE. Mr. Levin, I, too, rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Maryland Senator Paul Sarbanes.  The magnitude of his loss can be felt throughout Maryland and the  country.  Senator Sarbanes spent his entire career fighting for the issues that  Marylanders care the most about. He was a champion for justice,  authoring the first article of impeachment against a corrupt President.  He was a champion for fairness, tackling corporate regulatory reform  and ensuring transparency for investors. He was a champion for the  environment, spearheading efforts to protect Maryland's beloved  Chesapeake Bay for generations to come.  It is not just his long list of accomplishments that Senator Sarbanes  will be remembered for, it is also his dedication to the people.  Senator Sarbanes defined what it means to be a public servant. He  showed up in the communities that felt left behind. He listened to the  concerns of his constituents, and he worked hard to get things done for  our State and the country.  That type of leadership is hard to find here in Washington. We can  all learn a lot from him. I know I have. My wife, June, and I extend  our condolences to the friends and family of Senator Sarbanes,  especially to his son, our friend, Congressman John Sarbanes.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
