Trey Hollingsworth,0.0795210897922515,R," Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Madam Speaker, Thomas Lavell Secrest passed away  this week after a life full of service to his country.  Tom was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, and attended the U.S. Military  Academy at West Point from 1966 to 1970. After graduation, Tom served  in Germany and Fort Knox, achieving the rank of captain, as a tanker.  Tom is remembered by his West Point classmates as a smart and kind guy.  After his service in the Army, Tom returned to Texas to attend law  school at the University of Texas and then went on to a very successful  legal career in New York City. Over his career, Tom represented  Polaroid, AT&T, Lucent, and Hunter Douglas in defending their  intellectual property. Tom's demand for uncompromised performance was  evident in every pursuit of his life: academic, military, professional,  and personal.  Tom spent the last few years of his life in South Carolina with his  beloved wife, Liz, where they enjoyed their mutual passion for golf.  Throughout their marriage, they also ensured that their friends, their  family could participate in their love for golf, including Golf  Magazine's editor-in-chief, George Peper.  In 2002, George highlighted his friend Tom's spirit both on and off  the golf course in an article that tells you exactly who he was: an  ardent believer in hard work, a fiercely loyal friend, husband, and  father. He was someone who never missed an opportunity to hit the  links. And while always staying humble, Tom's golf game was legendary.  A golfer once said that many golfers argue very frequently, very  vigorously about where they played or which course was the best; but,  at the end of their lives, what they will remember is with whom they  played. Tom truly embodied this by always remembering it was with whom  you played that mattered most. He played with his favorite friends, his  family.  He is survived by his wife, his son, his daughter-in-law, his  brothers, his nieces, his nephews, and his grandchildren. I know each  of them will miss him dearly but will carry on the legacy of  earnestness and humor that he instilled in each of them.  Tom is someone whom those around him could always rely on, but he was  taken from us far too son. Our country and his family are better off  because of his life, because of his service, and because of his spirit.  Madam Speaker, may Tom rest in peace.    "
