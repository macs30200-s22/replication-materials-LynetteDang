Xochitl Torres Small,1.7758245468139648,D," Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today in support  of the legislation before us, the ``Indian Community Economic  Enhancement Act,''--the Senate companion to my bill in the House.  For too long, lack of access to credit and community development have  hampered the entrepreneurial spirit of Native American tribes. Yet,  across the country, Native American entrepreneurs are ready to start  new businesses, create jobs, and lift up their communities.  My bill is a first step to change that. It updates and provides new  resources to the Department of Commerce's Office of Native American  Business Development. It ensures the Department of Health and Human  Services is using Native American labor and industry products when  appropriate. And, it authorizes the Administration for Native Americans  to provide key financial assistance to Native American community  development financial institutions.  I want to thank my friend Congresswoman Haaland for co-leading this  bill with me, and Senator Hoeven, Chairman of the Senate Committee on  Indian Affairs, for introducing and shepherding this bill in the  Senate.  The American people and Native communities, should be reassured that  there is bipartisan commitment to improving lives in Indian Country.  I urge my colleagues, to vote yes and join us in empowering the  Native American entrepreneurs and communities who are building  solutions for a better tomorrow.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Case) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, "", S. 212, ', as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    "
