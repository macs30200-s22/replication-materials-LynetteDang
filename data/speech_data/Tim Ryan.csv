Tim Ryan,0.8535080552101135,D," Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about ', H.R. 5023, "", which  names the Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient  clinic in Youngstown, Ohio, as the Carl Nunziato VA Clinic.  This bill was recommended to my office and strongly supported by  leaders within my congressional district's veterans community because  they rightly wish to honor one of their own for his exemplary service.  I thank them and Chairman Mark Takano, Ranking Member Dr. Phil Roe, and  their respective staffs for helping our office bring this bill to the  floor, as well as my own staff, Zach Prager and Ivan De La Cruz  Santiago.  Today is a red-letter day, Mr. Speaker, in my book because in the  midst of all that is going on nationally, all the controversies,  Congress can still put its differences aside to take time and recognize  a true American hero: Carl Nunziato.  Carl was born in Youngstown, Ohio, in 1938, graduating from Rayen  High School. After marrying his high school sweetheart, Clara, he would  go on to attend college at Youngstown State University.  Through the university's Reserve Officer Training Corps program, Carl  earned a commission as a second lieutenant in the United States Army.  It was with his heart filled with love and devotion to his family, his  hometown, and his country that he set off for the battlefields of  Vietnam.  All those who served with Carl testify to his unmatched fighting  spirit. If you ever found yourself in a foxhole with chaos all around  you, Carl was the guy you wanted there with you because no matter what  happened, you could be sure of one thing: Carl would never quit. Never.  Life would test Carl in ways that most Americans can't even imagine.  On November 22, 1966, Carl lost both of his legs when an enemy mortar  round impacted less than 3 feet away from him as he was running toward  his unit's command center.  On that battlefield, and over the next 2 years at home, Carl would  fight for his life not far from where we stand today, at Walter Reed  National Military Medical Center. Carl may have walked out of that  hospital on two prosthetic legs, but his resolve was more steadfast  than before he walked in.  Carl returned to his hometown, Youngstown, Ohio, enrolled in law  school at Case Western Reserve, and with graduation began yet another  battle: the fight for veterans and all Americans with disabilities.  As an attorney utilizing a wheelchair in the 1970s, most of the  courthouses he encountered lacked the accessibility that he and other  Americans like him needed to be able to simply get his job done.  Carl saw the problem and seized the initiative, as he had always done  with obstacles he encountered in life. Carl created a committee to  fight for veterans with disabilities and became a relentless advocate  on behalf of all of those with the same conditions.  But Carl went even further. He established a task force to improve  veterans services in Youngstown at a time when the VA sent the city a  single nurse once a week when the Mahoning Valley had 40,000 veterans.  Carl wanted a VA clinic. VA said no. Carl didn't take no for an  answer. Carl's efforts came to fruition in 1991 when the VA finally  established an outpatient clinic in Youngstown.  Today, Carl continues to be a stellar citizen, not just for  Youngstown, not just for the people of Ohio, not just for vets, not  just for people with disabilities, but for all Americans.  Carl works tirelessly with the VA to continue improving the care  received by veterans. Carl relentlessly pursues improving care and  services for all Americans with disabilities.  The naming of this clinic, Mr. Speaker, is a small measure in  comparison to what he has accomplished on behalf of our country's  heroes and all of those with disabilities.  Carl never quits--never has quit, never will quit. And I am humbled  to have the privilege of representing an individual of this caliber in  this Chamber.  I will say, finally, when other vets and citizens from our community  look at Carl's portrait hanging in this clinic and they see his name,  they will know that things can get better. With effort, with grit, you  can make a difference as long as you never quit, as long as you never  take no for an answer.    "
