Brian Fitzpatrick,0.4403816163539886,R," Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a  very special human being, Mr. Charles Ellzy, who our community lost  earlier this year.  Mr. Speaker, Charles was a proud graduate of Bensalem High School and  Temple University.  In 1963, Charles met the love of his life, Rosia. They would go on to  have two children, Samantha and Vincent.  Charles dedicated his entire life to bettering our community. He  spent over 25 years working for the Department of Defense in  Philadelphia, and Charles was also the president of the Lin-Park Civic  Association.  Under his leadership, the LPCA established a community baseball  league, organized fundraising events, and collaborated with Betz  Laboratories to create the Lin-Park Betz Scholarship.  Mr. Speaker, Charles also served for years as a deacon at the  Linconia Tabernacle Christian Center in Bensalem. His connection and  love for God fueled his complete and total dedication to others.  And in August, the Bensalem Township Council unanimously passed a  resolution renaming Warren Avenue to Charles Ellzy Way in his honor.  Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, I had the honor of joining Charles'  family and congregants of the Linconia Tabernacle Christian Center for  the unveiling of such a fitting tribute to an amazing man.  Mr. Speaker, we are extremely grateful for Charles' contributions,  for his 80 years of life, and may the spirit of his generosity and  service continue to inspire our community. Charles is now reaping the  reward of a life he spent serving others.    "
