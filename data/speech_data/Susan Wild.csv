Susan Wild,0.4976000487804413,D," Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of a hero in my  community who recently passed away from this devastating virus. Robert  S. Washock, Jr., or Bob as he was known to everyone, was a devoted  father, grandfather, husband, brother, and friend. He defended our  Nation in the United States Navy and was a member of Dyle E. Bray VFW  Post 739 in Bangor, Pennsylvania, serving as quartermaster and  treasurer of the Home Association.  I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to know Bob, and the  qualities that I can speak to are those that touched the lives of  countless people across our community: kindness, humor, and compassion.  The tributes that have poured in from people of every walk of life  reflect the world of difference that he made.  At this extraordinarily difficult time for Bob's family and many  friends, I extend my deepest condolences. On behalf of a grateful  community, it is my honor to pay tribute to Bob for his lifelong  service as an Active Duty servicemember and as a proud veteran to the  country he loved. His spirit will endure.    "
