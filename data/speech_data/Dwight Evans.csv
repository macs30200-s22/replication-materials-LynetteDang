Dwight Evans,0.1411499232053756,D," Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, in my city of Philadelphia and across the  country, people of color are thrown in jail more and with harsher  sentences than White people for the same cannabis-related crimes.  Cannabis is one of the fastest growing U.S. industries, but Federal  law keeps many businesses of color out of this market. That is why I  urge my colleagues to support passage of a jobs bill, the MORE Act. It  would decriminalize cannabis at the Federal level and expunge prior  Federal convictions related to marijuana. Half of all States have  already decriminalized cannabis.  This jobs bill would also create the opportunity trust fund, which  would generate grant programs to provide services and funds to those  most negatively impacted by the war on drugs. This includes the  equitable cannabis licensing program that I introduced in the Homegrown  Act.  The House and Senate need to pass the MORE Act now, as the growing  cannabis industry is an important economic development tool for  communities of color like mine. Let's pass this jobs bill.    "
