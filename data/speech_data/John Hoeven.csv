John Hoeven,1.268555998802185,R," Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I would just like to say how much I  appreciate Senator Cramer, the working relationship that we have, not  just here but a working relationship that goes back many, many years.  As you can tell, he speaks very well, but what comes through is not  only his commitment to his family and his faith, but his commitment to  the people of North Dakota and his commitment to the people of this  country.  It doesn't matter what issue he is working on. He takes the time to  listen to everybody, and he is always willing to explain where he is  coming from and why he comes to the conclusion he does. But there is no  question, he loves his faith; he loves his family; he loves his State;  and he loves this country.  Thank you, Madam President.  I yield the floor.
