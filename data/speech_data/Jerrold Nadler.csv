Jerrold Nadler,3.0171329975128174,D," Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have introduced "", H.R. 3884, "", the  ``Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2020,'' or  the ``MORE Act of 2020.''  This long overdue legislation would reverse the failed policy of  criminalizing marijuana on the federal level and would take steps to  address the heavy toll this policy has taken across the country,  particularly on communities of color.  The MORE Act would make three important changes to federal law:  (1) remove marijuana, or cannabis, from the list of federally  controlled substances;  (2) authorize the provision of resources, funded by an excise tax on  marijuana, to address the needs of communities that have been seriously  impacted by the War on Drugs, including increasing the participation of  communities of color in the burgeoning cannabis market; and  (3) provide for the expungement of Federal marijuana convictions and  arrests.  For far too long, we have treated marijuana as a criminal justice  problem instead of as a matter of personal choice and public health.  Whatever one's views are on the use of marijuana for recreational or  medicinal use, the policy of arrests, prosecution, and incarceration at  the Federal level has proven unwise and unjust.  This issue is not new to Congress. There have been many Members who  have introduced bills upon which provisions in this bill are based. For  instance, Representative Barbara Lee has sponsored bills that are the  foundation of key provisions of the MORE Act, and I thank her for her  longstanding leadership on this issue. Representative Earl Blumenauer  has also been an indefatigable advocate and has supported everything we  have done to get to where we are today. I thank him, as well.  Federal action on this issue would follow the growing recognition in  the states that the status quo is unacceptable. Despite the federal  government's continuing criminalization of marijuana, 36 states and the  District of Columbia have legalized medical cannabis. Fifteen states  and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for adult  recreational use.  I have long believed that the criminalization of marijuana has been a  mistake, and the racially disparate enforcement of marijuana laws has  only compounded this mistake, with serious consequences, particularly  for communities of color.  Marijuana is one of the oldest agricultural commodities not grown for  food, and it has [["", Page , H6838, ] been used medicinally all over the world since at least 2700 B.C., but  its criminalization is a relatively recent phenomenon.  The use of marijuana, which most likely originated in Asia, later  spread to Europe, and made its way to the Americas when the Jamestown  settlers brought it with them across the Atlantic. The cannabis plant  has been widely grown in the United States and was used as a component  in fabrics during the middle of the 19th century. During that time  period, cannabis was also widely used as a treatment for a multitude of  ailments, including muscle spasms, headaches, cramps, asthma, and  diabetes.  It was only in the early part of the 20th century that marijuana  began to be criminalized in the United States--mainly because of  misinformation and hysteria, based at least in part on racially-biased  stereotypes connecting marijuana use and people of color, particularly  African-Americans and Latinos. In 1970, when President Nixon announced  the War on Drugs and signed the Controlled Substances Act into law, the  federal government placed marijuana on Schedule I, the most restrictive  schedule that is attached to the most serious criminal penalties,  where--unfairly and unjustifiably--it has remained ever since.  As a consequence of this decision, thousands of individuals-- overwhelmingly people of color--have been subjected, by the federal  government, to unjust prison sentences for marijuana offenses. It is  time for this manifest injustice to end. The MORE Act would remove  marijuana from Schedule I and the Controlled Substances Act altogether,  thereby decriminalizing it at the Federal level.  This is only fair, particularly because the same racial animus  motivating the enactment of marijuana laws also led to racially  disproportionate enforcement of such laws, which has had a substantial,  negative impact on communities of color. In fact, nationwide, the  communities that have been most harmed by marijuana enforcement are  benefitting the least from the legal marijuana marketplace.  The MORE Act would address some of these negative impacts, by  establishing an Opportunity Trust Fund within the Department of  Treasury to fund programs within the Department of Justice and the  Small Business Administration to empower communities of color and those  adversely impacted by the War on Drugs. These programs would provide  services to individuals, including job training, reentry services and  substance use disorder services; provide funds for loans to assist  small businesses that are owned and controlled by socially and  economically disadvantaged individuals; and provide resources for  programs that minimize barriers to marijuana licensing and employment  for individuals adversely impacted by the War on Drugs.  The collateral consequences of a conviction for marijuana  possession--and even sometimes for a mere arrest--can be devastating.  For those saddled with a criminal conviction, it can be difficult or  impossible to vote, to obtain educational loans, to get a job, to  maintain a professional license, to secure housing, to receive  government assistance, or even to adopt a child.  These exclusions create an often-permanent second-class status for  millions of Americans. This is unacceptable and counterproductive,  especially in light of the disproportionate impact that enforcement of  marijuana laws has had on communities of color. The MORE Act recognizes  this injustice and addresses these harmful effects by expunging and  sealing federal convictions and arrests for marijuana offenses.  It is not surprising that over the past two decades, public support  for legalizing marijuana has surged. In the most recent Pew Research  Center poll--which was released at the end of 2019--67 percent of  Americans now back marijuana legalization, up from 62 percent in Pew's  2018 poll. And just this November, there were ballot measures  pertaining to marijuana in several states; they were all approved by  voters. Indeed, the states have led the way--and continue to lead the  way--on marijuana, but our federal laws have not kept pace with the  obvious need for change. We need to catch up because the public  supports reform and because it is the right thing to do.  In my view, applying criminal penalties, with their attendant  collateral consequences for marijuana offenses is unjust and harmful to  our society. The MORE Act comprehensively addresses this injustice, and  I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill today.    "
