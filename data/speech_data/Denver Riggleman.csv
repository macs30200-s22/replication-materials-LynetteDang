Denver Riggleman,0.3167714178562164,R," Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my gratitude and  appreciation for Esther Page, my constituent services director.  Known as the Constituent Whisperer and Queen of Casework, Esther is  retiring this January after 31 years of service.  She truly is the model of what a nonpartisan public servant should  be, having shown the same care and devotion for Virginia's Fifth  District even as the seat swapped back and forth between parties.  I will read a comment from one of my constituents who benefited from  Ms. Page's service: ``I felt from her very first contact that she was  committed to advocating for me and my best interests. Without Ms. Page,  I truly believe that I would still be waiting, my case file deeply  buried on someone's desk.''  Her devout faith was an example to me and all constituents she  helped. She will be retiring to her home in Nelson County this January,  and I wish her a long and fulfilling retirement.  Esther, I think I speak for all the Fifth District in offering my  deepest appreciation for the service you have done.  This is not in the speech but know that we all love you.    "
