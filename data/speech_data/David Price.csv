David Price,0.4879726469516754,D," Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a  faithful servant of the people's House, Parliamentarian Tom Wickham.  Tom is only the fifth Parliamentarian in this institution's history,  and he is concluding his 25 years of service in the Parliamentarian's  Office this week.  One of the distinguishing features of Tom's service has been his work  with the House Democracy Partnership and his willingness to extend  himself internationally, to share his experiences and insight with  those organizing and administering parliaments in emerging, often  struggling democracies.  Just last fall, Members would have been heartened to see the  reception that Tom, along with Clerk Cheryl Johnson and Shuwanza Goff,  received from their counterparts in Kenya, Liberia, Ethiopia, and The  Gambia.  We have all benefited from Tom's dedicated service and the skill,  integrity, and fairness he has brought to the Parliamentarian's role.  We wish him and his family Godspeed as they begin the next chapter of  their lives.    "
