Janice Schakowsky,1.630041241645813,D," Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I also thank Representative Guthrie, who  cosponsored this legislation with me, and also Chairman Pallone and  Chairman Bobby Rush for their help in moving this bill forward.  This is a bipartisan bill that provides an important fix to an energy  conservation rule for ceiling fans that the Department of Energy  finalized in January 2017.  However, minor technical changes to the rule were needed in order to  prevent a major unintended consequence. Without this bill, some of the  most energy-efficient, large-diameter ceiling fans would have to be  taken off the market in the United States. So we fixed that.  The bill will also provide consistent labeling requirements for  residential ceiling fans and simplify the ENERGY STAR program. Both of  these changes will make it easier for Americans to choose the right  products for their homes. Representative Guthrie and I worked together  with ceiling fan manufacturers, the energy efficiency community, and  other stakeholders to clarify the standard. The Department of Energy  was consulted throughout the drafting process.  What pleases me really the most about this legislation is that it  highlights how we need legislation, big and small, to tackle the  climate crisis.  This bill also highlights how we can work together across the aisle  to enact commonsense policies that directly impact energy usage in  homes and save American families money on their energy bill at the same  time.  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing to work together with my  Republican colleagues in the next Congress.    "
