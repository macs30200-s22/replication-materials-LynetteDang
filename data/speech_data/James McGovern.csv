James McGovern,1.080399990081787,D," Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to  me.  Madam Speaker, across America, people are dealing with a loss of a  job, a business, or even a loved one. People are hurting, and they are  hurting badly not only from this pandemic, but also from the  incompetence, the callousness, and the negligence of the current  occupant of the White House.  When I talk about people hurting, I don't mean big corporations or  Fortune 500 companies. I am talking about our workers, our middle  class, those on the edge of the middle class, and those struggling in  poverty. That is where our focus should be. And thanks to the  bipartisan efforts of Members on both sides of the Capitol, we are  acting right now--not next year or during the next administration, as  some have suggested--but right now.  This deal is not everything I want--not by a long shot--but the  choice before us is simple. It is about whether [["", Page , H7293, ] we help families or not. It is about whether we help small businesses  and restaurants or not. It is about whether we boost SNAP benefits and  strengthen antihunger programs or not. And it is about whether we help  those dealing with a job loss or not.  To me, this is not a tough call. We need to pass this, and then we  need to prepare to build on it in the next Congress, hopefully, in a  bipartisan fashion and with an administration that actually gives a  damn about the American people.  Madam Speaker, before I conclude, I also join the gentleman from  Oklahoma in recognizing the service of Congresswoman Shalala. Over the  years, she has had many titles: Doctor, treasurer, college president,  chancellor, assistant secretary, secretary, congresswoman--and I could  go on.  Often, Donna has done it first: She was among the very first Peace  Corps volunteers. She was the first woman to lead a Big 10 Conference  college. She was only the second woman to lead a major research  university. And Donna was the first Lebanese American to serve in a  President's Cabinet.  Madam Speaker, there is a saying in Arabic, which in English is: ``Do  good and throw it into the sea.''  It means this: The reward is doing good. Not the praise or  recognition. Just simply an act of doing good.  And Donna Shalala does good, period. I know she will continue to do  good.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.    "
