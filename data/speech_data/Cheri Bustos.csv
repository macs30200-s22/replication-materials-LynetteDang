Cheri Bustos,0.91426819562912,D," Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of Daniel  Miller, the eldest of six children, from Galesburg, Illinois.  A member of the varsity football team, his principal described him as  ``always smiling'' and ``caring about everyone.''  In 2004, he joined the Air Force and continued to lead as a senior  airman. With great courage, he defused explosive devices and worked  with chemical and biological weapons.  On January 7, 2007, Senior Airman Miller, Senior Airman Elizabeth A.  Loncki, and Technical Sergeant Timothy R. Weiner all made the ultimate  sacrifice, attempting to defuse a car bomb in Iraq.  Our Nation will never be able to repay them, but it is our duty to  remember their service. It is my honor today to commemorate the service  of Senior Airman Miller with the dedication of the U.S. Post Office on  East Main Street in Galesburg, Illinois, as the Senior Airman Daniel  Miller Post Office Building.
