Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,0.2087428569793701,D," Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address what is top  of mind to Americans across the country, and that is the extraordinary  economic and health hardship of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout this  year.  The reason I decided to rise today is because we are here convening  in Washington, and just a day or two ago, the Senate majority leader,  Senator McConnell, decided to break the Senate.  He broke the Senate as there are thousands of people in Texas lined  up for food lines. He broke the Senate while hospitals no longer have  beds to house the sick. He broke the Senate and dismissed the Senate  while 30 million Americans are on the brink of eviction.  He dismissed the Senate when every single day when we go back to our  communities, people are asking us: Is there going to be help? Is there  going to be a second stimulus check? Are we going to get the resources  that we need?  He broke the Senate. And in breaking the Senate, we are abandoning  our people.  Thanksgiving is around the corner, and there are millions of  Americans that won't be able to afford a meal to eat, that don't know  if they will be kicked out of their home, that are unsure if they are  going to have to quit their job to care for their child. And we are  having entire bodies, and the Senate prides itself as one of the most  deliberative bodies, they abandoned them.  The number of Americans living in poverty since May has grown by 8  million people, since just May 2020. According to a study from Columbia  University, this rise in poverty has been concentrated in Black and  Latino children and people.  The CARES Act stimulus checks and unemployment benefits lifted more  than 18 million individuals in the United States out of monthly poverty  in April alone. But this number fell from 18 million to 4 million  individuals in August and September after unemployment benefits were  expired.  Just 44 percent of people in the United States are very confident  that they can afford the needed food that will be necessary for the  next 4 weeks. That means the majority of people in the United States  are not very confident in their ability to eat over the next 4 weeks,  according to a new Census survey data. About 10 percent, or 3.5 million  households, are not at all confident in their ability to eat the week  before Thanksgiving, and the Senate broke. It is unconscionable,  unconscionable leadership to abandon our people.  {time} 1230  And while we are arguing about negotiations, and while we are arguing  about points, people are going hungry. And we are dismissing their  needs as blue State needs or as bailouts depending on what party you  voted for. Hunger has no party. Illness has no party. And when we allow  suffering to be alleviated or concentrated based on political  affiliation, we are doing a disservice to our entire Nation.  This uncertainty in food reflects food hardship across the country,  with 5.6 million households with children struggling to put enough food  on the table in the last 7 days.  Landlords filed at least 43,500 evictions in 17 major cities from  March until September. An estimated 13.4 million adults living in  rental housing today--nearly one-in-five renters--were not caught up on  rent.  Small businesses don't know if they are going to survive or exist in  a month, in a week, in January.  We cannot afford to wait for a new administration or another  election, or a political state of play. We need to get people help now,  and the Senate broke. They broke.  We are supposed to be here to work for everyday people. We are not  supposed to be here to work for political donors or political favors or  the powerful. We are here to serve the people who are most vulnerable,  all the way up to the top. But we start with the people most in need.  Our country is going hungry on the week before Thanksgiving, and the  Senate broke. I don't care what party you are. It is an abandonment of  our responsibilities as elected officials who are charged with acting  in the public trust.  The unemployment rate jumped in April to a level not seen since the  1930s and still stood at 6.9 percent in October. Some 10.8 percent of  Black workers and 8.8 percent of Latino workers were unemployed in  October compared to 6 percent of White workers. Last week, 1.1 million  Americans filed new unemployment claims. Today, 4.4 million Americans  are receiving pandemic emergency unemployment compensation, up from 1.4  million in August.  Last week was the 35th straight week total initial claims were  greater than the worst week of the Great Recession, and the Senate  broke.  You know, I want to address some of the claims, because yesterday I  said that we need to make sure that people get economic relief due to  these shutdowns. And I was surprised to hear so many Republicans now  concerned about how we are going to pay for it or using other people's  money. But the Senate majority leader wasn't concerned about other  people's money when he authorized a $4 trillion leveraged bailout for  Wall Street in March. He wasn't concerned about where that money came  from. He wasn't concerned about how we were going to pay for that.  It is only when we are talking about relief for working people, for  children, for families, for parents, for education, for healthcare  that, all of a sudden, we can't pay for any of these things. But when  it comes to tax subsidies for private jets, we have got the money for  that. When it comes to the endless appropriation towards more and more  military spending, when we aren't even, technically, in growing  elements of war, according to some people, we have money for that. But  we don't have money to feed our own kids. We don't have money to  educate people. We don't have money to provide healthcare.  But we have money for private jets. We have money for tax loopholes  for yachts. We have money to incentivize stock buybacks. We have a  billion dollars to invest in research and development for a vaccine-- which was proudly invested in and a good use of public funds--just for  pharmaceutical companies to take these publicly developed drugs and  then sell them back to the public at no discount, so we don't even get  a return on this investment. How is that fiscally responsible?  So we are living in a world and a state of play in our governance  where the party who is eager to help subsidize private jets somehow  can't find the dollars and the cents to get people a $1,200 check. It  is unconscionable, and it is wrong. And the Senate broke.  I am rising today, because it is extraordinarily difficult to  represent a [["", Page , H6010, ] working-class district, not a private jet district, and go home every  week, just as I am about to do again, and feel as helpless in this body  because the majority of its Members and the majority of the Senate  can't seem to get it together and get people the help that we need. And  the Senate broke.  This is what I have to do. This is what we are resorting to, speaking  to an empty room because the Senate broke.  So if there is anything that I have left to say, if there is anybody  out there that is listening, if you are a working family, if you are  struggling to get the food that you need, if you feel like you are on  the brink of eviction, we see you. We see you.  What I ask of the Senate and what I ask of our Republican colleagues  in the Senate is to act as if you were the one that was going hungry.  Act as if it is you getting evicted from your house. Act with that  urgency.  That is all I have to say.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    "
