Tom McClintock,0.0695809498429298,R," Mr. McCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, let's get this straight. The small  shopkeeper who has lost their entire savings because of the lockdowns  will get the same $2,000 grant as the government bureaucrat who has  been enjoying a steady paycheck at home for the past 10 months.  This money is wholly inadequate for those who have been harmed by the  lockdowns and wholly unnecessary for those who have not.  This free money doesn't come from Heaven. It comes from the future  earnings of those who will be struggling to get back on their feet,  making the post-lockdown recovery more difficult and prolonged.  Much of the burden of this debt will fall on the young, who have  already borne the brunt of these lockdowns. It is, in a real sense, a  massive wealth transfer from the future to the present, from the young  to the old, and from those who have been hurt by the lockdowns to those  who have not.  There is only one way to end the suffering caused by these lockdowns,  and that is to end them.    "
