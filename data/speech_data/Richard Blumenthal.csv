Richard Blumenthal,0.8352050185203552,D," Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Dan Freedman on the occasion of his retirement. Throughout his impressive 32 years as a correspondent in the Hearst Washington Bureau, Dan set an example of tireless, honest reporting. He undertook the monumental task of covering the Connecticut and New York delegations with rigor and expertise. Even as the media environment grows more [[<a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7205"">Page S7205</a>]] partisan, Dan has remained fair and dedicated to the facts. Dan has helped build an essential professional foundation for countless reporters, mentoring hundreds of newcomers and interns and holding everyone--including himself--to the highest standards. Regarded with immense respect by his colleagues, he routinely challenged himself in order to set a better example for his team and raise the expectations for outstanding reporting. In DC, legislators trust Dan to deliver a truthful and balanced story. This integrity is essential for the people of Connecticut who rely on reporters like Dan to inform them about the Nation's Capital with a focus on the stories that matter most to them and their communities. Constituents need to know their voices are being heard, and Dan is there to ask the tough questions and to deliver the most complete and honest reporting possible. During an over four-decade career in journalism, Dan did it all-- everything from dodging bullets in wars and insurrections in Central America to covering eight Supreme Court confirmation hearings and even a stint on the George W. Bush Presidential campaign in 2000. His unfailing commitment to his profession was recognized in 2018, when he won the David Lynch Memorial Award for Regional Reporting. Dan's outstanding record of thoughtful, honest, and determined reporting sets a model and demonstrates the critical role of reporters in keeping people throughout the country well informed. I applaud his lifetime of dogged devotion to bringing the truth to light through fair, fact-filled pieces, and I know my colleagues will join me in thanking Dan for his extraordinary contributions to regional reporting.<bullet>   "
