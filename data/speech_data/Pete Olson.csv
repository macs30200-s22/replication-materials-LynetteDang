Pete Olson,0.6535427570343018,R," Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to do something Texans love to  do: to brag about my home State. I am going to brag about two Texas-22  volleyball teams that made the Texas finals this past weekend.  The Fulshear Chargers have played 4 short years of high school  volleyball. It took them only 3 years to win the State title in class  4-A. That was last year. This year, they moved up to class 5-A. A  downgrade? No. They went to the 5-A State finals, losing to undefeated  Lovejoy.  In 6-A, the Seven Lakes Spartans were amazing. Despite having half  the team down with COVID and not being able to practice for 2\\1/2\\  weeks, they won the 6-A championship, the first team ever in the 101- year history of the Katy Independent School District to win the State  title.  Madam Speaker, 1 million neighbors in Texas-22 and Santa Clause  congratulate and are darn proud of our Spartans and our Chargers. They  have proved once and for all: Don't mess with Texas-22 volleyball  teams.  Ho, ho, ho. [["", Page , H7264, ]      "
