Jodey Arrington,0.1988027095794677,R," Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation to  provide relief to our fellow Americans, accelerate our Nation's  economic recovery, and ensure our great Nation comes back better,  stronger, and healthier than ever.  I don't want to belabor my deep concerns with the process except to  say, Mr. Speaker, that it is fundamentally broken and that it was  unnecessarily prolonged for purely political reasons. The American  people waited, and waited for months. They deserve better, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend, fellow Texan and ranking member,  Kay Granger; our leader, Kevin McCarthy; Kevin Brady; and many others  who helped finalize this agreement.  It is far from perfect. I haven't met perfect legislation since  coming to Washington. But it does a good job of supporting our  struggling families, small businesses, healthcare professionals,  teachers, and other frontline workers at a time when many desperately  need it, and all of this at a fraction of Speaker Pelosi's $3.3  trillion bailout bonanza, which included cash for illegals, legalizing  marijuana, and a host of other unnecessary and irresponsible  provisions.  Mr. Speaker, it is no small feat to keep our annual spending below  the budget cap, and I commend my colleagues, including Chairwoman  Lowey, for that.  To do that and prevail in protecting troops and including their pay  raise, funding for the border wall, preserving [["", Page , H7307, ] the sacred protections for our unborn, I have got to tell you, that is  pretty darn good.  It is hard for me to stand for some of this stuff in this bill, this  omnibus. But on balance, it is good for the country, and I am standing  with Chairwoman Lowey, and I am standing with my fellow Texan, Kay  Granger.  God bless America.    "
