Jackie Speier,0.985162079334259,D," Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time and for  his outstanding leadership, patience, and perseverance.  I also thank Ranking Member Thornberry for his many years of  distinguished service to our Nation, both in the military and in  Congress.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the committee, Mr. Kelly;  also the committee staff, Craig, David, Hannah; and my personal staff,  Josh, Brian, and Luke.  Before I speak about the conference agreement, I feel like I must  speak about the Fort Hood Independent Review, which was ordered after  Specialist Vanessa Guillen's murder. This is the report. It is being  released in a matter of 3 minutes by the Secretary of the Army. I won't  go into details, but I will say that it is a damning expose of a system  at Fort Hood that does a shameful disservice to the sacrifices of our  servicemembers and their families.  The report makes clear what I have been saying since before I was on  the Armed Services Committee, that the Army sexual assault and  harassment response has failed, that servicemembers are afraid to  report, believe they will not be taken seriously and will be retaliated  against, and that major systemic changes are needed, including greater  independence from the chain of command for handling sexual assault and  harassment.  Any parent reading this report would have to ask themselves: Is my  son or daughter safe in the military?  This bill is not perfect. Important provisions on sexual assault and  domestic violence were left out. But this conference agreement would  make progress, including a new confidential reporting option for sexual  harassment and a provision to ensure that servicemembers who report  sexual assault are not disciplined for related minor infractions.  It also includes a pay raise for servicemembers, long-overdue  provisions to promote racial and gender equity within the armed  services, including goals for accessions and promotions of persons of  color and women, as well as the creation of a new deputy inspector  general for diversity and inclusion that will investigate White  supremacists' activities by servicemembers.  Additionally, the bill expands support for childcare and provides for  exceptional family member services.  Therefore, I will be voting for the bill, and I hope my colleagues  will join me in this. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to recognize  that this is just the beginning. We have more to do. More lives are  lost and must be accounted for.    "
