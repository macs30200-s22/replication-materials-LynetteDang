Jason Crow,0.5572408437728882,D," Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I grew up knowing what it felt like to  struggle financially, that fear and anxiety of not knowing where your  next rent check would come from, working a shift at Arby's or a 14-hour  day on the construction site and still not making ends meet. That is  why I am voting for this bill.  As imperfect as it is--and there are plenty of things that are not in  this bill that should be--it will provide immediate relief for millions  of families and small businesses that simply can't wait any longer,  including those that are left out of prior rounds of relief.  For example, my district is one of the most diverse districts in the  Nation and home to thousands of refugees and immigrants. That is why I  have been fighting hard to get payments to mixed-status ITIN families  in this bill. We have been successful in doing that.  Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with the Biden  administration to provide more relief in the coming months so that we  can tackle this crisis together.    "
