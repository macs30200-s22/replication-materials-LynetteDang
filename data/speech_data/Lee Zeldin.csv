Lee Zeldin,0.8409315943717957,R," Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure,  which prioritizes six key projects for New York's First Congressional  District, a district almost completely surrounded by water.  On the east end of Long Island, we have a unique responsibility to  safeguard our local waterways, from bolstering our local maritime  infrastructure to managing future storm risks.  Working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and the Army  Corps team at its New York district office, this bill prioritizes local  projects that are vital to my congressional district.  The Fire Island to Montauk Point project includes essential dredging  and shoreline projects over 83 miles of coastline. Coastal storm risk  management for Hashamomuck Cove in Southold is included, where, right  now, local residents, businesses, and first responders are paralyzed  even during a severe thunderstorm.  Additionally, this legislation authorizes a feasibility study for a  project at Wading River Creek in Riverhead and expedites feasibility  studies for projects at Reel Point Preserve and Shelter Island,  Goldsmith Inlet in Southold, and Lake Montauk Harbor in Montauk.  Continuing to safeguard and invest in our maritime infrastructure  will help preserve Long Island's way of life for generations to come.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I thank the chair and ranking member for their leadership in making  this a reality.    "
