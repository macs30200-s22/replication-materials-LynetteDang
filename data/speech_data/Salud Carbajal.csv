Salud Carbajal,0.8887825608253479,D," Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, more than 245,000 Americans have already  died due to COVID-19. Cases are surging to unprecedented levels.  Millions are facing poverty, food insecurity, and eviction. Low-income,  homeless, and minority communities have been hit especially hard and  disproportionately.  With the winter and holidays upon us, this wave threatens the health  and economic well-being of our entire country. I am proud that we have  already enacted four bipartisan economic relief packages that delivered  targeted assistance to those impacted by this pandemic. We need to do  it again. We must act now during this Congress.  Another relief package should include a robust national strategy for  testing, tracing, and vaccination. Businesses, local governments,  workers, and families need help to make ends meet. We must come  together to deliver and help America with the urgent needs that it has  and get this virus under control.    "
