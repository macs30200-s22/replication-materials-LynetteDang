Greg Walden,0.6953604817390442,R," Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to mark the passing of a  longtime friend and community leader, Ken Hattrup of Sherman County,  and The Dalles, Oregon. [[', Page , H7242, ]  Ken was born in Keuterville, Idaho, on July 28, 1928. He was one of  six children. About 7 years later, his family moved to The Dalles,  Oregon, where he graduated from St. Mary's Academy High School in 1946.  Along the way, he met his future wife, Marie von Borstel. In the  spring of 1951, Ken and Marie were married. Shortly thereafter, Uncle  Sam came calling, and Ken was drafted into the U.S. Army, where he  served during the war in Korea.  After he returned home and earned a degree in economics, they settled  on a wheat ranch in Sherman County. Like most ranchers I know, Ken  loved the land and practiced progressive conservation efforts. He  enjoyed hunting, traveling, and playing cards with friends.  It is reported that he was a popular poker dealer at the veterans'  home in The Dalles, bringing much joy to those who, like him, wore our  Nation's uniform and preserved our freedom and way of life.  I always appreciated Ken's friendship and counsel over the years.  Mylene and I extend our deepest sympathies to his family during this  difficult time of loss.    "
