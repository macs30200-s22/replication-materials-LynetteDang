Bob Gibbs,0.1590421795845031,R," Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, this bill provides funding that is already  there. Creating and peddling this conspiracy theory is irresponsible  and reckless. At a time when Russia and China are meddling in our  elections, we don't need help from Congress peddling fake news.  This is one bill that needs to be labeled, ``Return to sender.''  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the distinguished chair of  the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.    "
