Sherrod Brown,0.909487009048462,D," Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the exemplary  service of my now former chief of staff, Maia Hunt Estes.  Maia has been an indispensable adviser and confidante to me for more  than a decade, including my first days in Congress and during my tenure  as Maryland's Lieutenant Governor. It is fair to say that I wouldn't be  here today without her extraordinary counsel.  I could count on Maia day and night to get the job done. Maia brought  an unmatched level of commitment to every issue, every challenge, every  single fight, every constituent case, no matter how big or small.  Throughout our time together, Maia has provided strategic advice and  clear-eyed leadership on national security and defense, transportation  and infrastructure.  Maia served as my key liaison to the Congressional Black Caucus and  Democratic leadership on core issues to me and the people of Maryland.  Her deep understanding of the issues, candid advice, insightful  opinions, and passionate drive for serving others has helped me deliver  for my State, my constituents, our servicemembers, and our country.  Maia served as a mentor for my team, both in my district office and  on Capitol Hill. She led my staff to always put the needs of our  constituents first and work hard to enact real change.  I look forward to seeing the great work that Maia will do as she  takes on new challenges and, no doubt, excels.  Maia, thank you very much for your years of service. You have made a  difference in the lives of many, and I know you will continue to do so  in the years ahead.    "
