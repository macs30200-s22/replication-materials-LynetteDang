Bill Huizenga,0.3068313002586365,R," Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, having this updated information will help  us analyze and assess the threats facing the Great Lakes and allow us  to be more proactive instead of 100 percent reactive.  The Great Lakes are a way of life for many of us in west Michigan and  throughout the Great Lakes system, and these pristine resources help  define who we are as a community and a people. I will continue to work,  support, and advocate for commonsense reforms like today's legislation  that will protect these incredible natural resources for generations to  come.  I do want to thank my fellow colleagues who have been working on  this, Mr. Kildee from Michigan, Mr. Joyce from Ohio, and the rest of  the Great Lakes Task Force. This has been a great, true bipartisan  success story, as we have looked at increasing funding for protecting  the Great Lakes through the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, the  GLRI, as well as initiatives like this.
