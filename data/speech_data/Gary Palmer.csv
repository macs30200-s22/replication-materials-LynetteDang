Gary Palmer,1.0869542360305786,R," Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) for hosting this special hour to talk about the  Bible.  Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 419th anniversary of the King James  Version of the Bible. [["", Page , H7099, ]  In 1604, King James I commissioned 54 scholars from Oxford and  Cambridge Universities to produce one uniform translation of the Bible  that all denominations could accept. It is unlikely that there has ever  been another group of translators whose collective expertise in  Biblical languages was equal to this group.  Benson Bobrick, who wrote a book called ``Wide as the Waters,'' said,  because of the people's desire to read the Bible, the English  translation, known as the Authorized Version in Great Britain, helped  Great Britain become the most literate nation in the world. In terms of  the language of the King James Version, about 90 percent are Anglo- Saxon words with a vocabulary of only about 8,000 words for the entire  translation. It was the first major work of English prose based  primarily on Anglo-Saxon words instead of Latin.  The King James translation established the prose style for English  and American literature and became the foundation of modern English  language giving us words and phrases that are common parts of our  language today.  In his ``History of England,'' Thomas Macaulay said that `` . . . if  everything else in our language should perish, it would alone suffice  to show the whole extent of its beauty and power.''  Bobrick wrote: ``Its subsequent impact on English, and American,  literature might be traced in a thousand ways--in the work of religious  writers like Milton and Bunyan, or their more secular brethren like  D.H. Lawrence, Walt Whitman, and Defoe. Without the King James Version,  it has been said, `there would be no `Paradise Lost,' no `Pilgrim's  Progress' . . . no Gettysburg Address.' ''  As Britain's literacy rate increased, it fostered a spirit of inquiry  which led to people reading books and tracts that transformed the laws  and government of Great Britain and ultimately laid the foundation for  American political thought, and our Founders' ideas about individual  liberty and constitutional government.  Including the 1611 edition, there were four other editions of the  King James Bible, which were published in 1629, 1638, 1762, and 1769;  the last is the version that is most commonly cited today.  ``Next to the Bible itself,'' Bobrick wrote, ``the English Bible was,  and is, the most influential book ever published.''  According to Vanderbilt University Press, the King James Version is  the best-selling book of all time, with more than 5 billion copies  sold, and it is the most frequently quoted book ever written.  Russell Kirk concluded that it was the book that was to exert a  stronger influence than any other in America. He wrote: ``Read from  American pulpits and in the great majority of American households  during colonial times, the Authorized Version shaped the style,  informed the intellect, affected the laws, and decreed the morals of  the North American colonies.''  P. Marion Simms wrote: ``No nation in all history was ever founded by  people so dominated by the Bible as America.'' In fact, every American  President except Franklin Pierce has been sworn in with their hands  placed on the English Bible.  Even though it was published after the Jamestown Colony was  established, the King James Bible was the book that had the greatest  impact on the American culture.  ``The English did not really drive away the American colonists, nor  were they driven,'' said G.K. Chesterton. ``The Americans were led on  by a light that went before.''  The light was the Biblical light that the English Bible had given  them: the idea of the equality of man. It was the idea of the sacred  and equal importance of every man, as made in the image and likeness of  God.  One of the earliest copies of the King James Version Bible can be  seen at the Museum of the Bible. I encourage everyone to visit this  great American museum.  Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, Mr. Lamborn, for this great opportunity.    "
