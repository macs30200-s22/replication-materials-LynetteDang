Donald McEachin,1.093408226966858,D," Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of ', H.R. 1, ', the For  the People Act, and the need for Federal election reform.  Mr. Speaker, in the 2016 and 2018 election cycles, we witnessed overt  discrimination, disinformation, and intimidation tactics aimed at  disenfranchising our most vulnerable friends and neighbors.  Individuals and organizations intentionally aimed to spread deceptive  material regarding the time and place of elections, endorsements, and  voter eligibility. Moreover, there were also explicit attempts to  intimidate voters at the polls.  In my home, the Commonwealth of Virginia, there were reports of a man  standing in front of a polling place holding a Trump sign with a  barking German shepherd on the roof of his truck, and yet that man  broke no laws.  Such efforts can interfere with one of our basic rights as Americans:  the right to vote. As such, I am pleased that ', H.R. 1, ' includes language  from a bill I introduced in the last Congress with then-Ranking Member  Nadler, the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.  This language will prohibit the dissemination of false information  regarding Federal elections and prevent efforts to hinder, interfere,  or prevent a person from voting, registering to vote, or helping  another person to vote or register to vote. We, as Americans, shall  make it easier to vote, not harder, and this language will further that  goal.  In the same vein, I am equally proud that another bill has been  included in ', H.R. 1, ', the Election Day Holiday Act, which I cointroduced  with Congresswoman Eshoo in the last Congress. As the title suggests,  this bill would direct Federal agencies to treat election day as a  holiday and urge private employers to do the same. [[', Page , H233, ]  Going to the polls is among the most democratic of American  traditions. Making election day a holiday would honor that tradition,  while helping voters to continue it long into the future.  I thank my friend and colleague, Congressman Sarbanes, for  introducing this historic bill. I thank all of the many Members and  stakeholders who have helped shape this bill and who have seen fit to  support the measures I have described.  As the name indicates, this bill is for the people, and I look  forward to the day when we do the people's work and pass it.    "
