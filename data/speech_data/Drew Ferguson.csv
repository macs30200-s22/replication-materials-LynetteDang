Drew Ferguson,0.3087374567985534,R," Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman and the  ranking member for this opportunity, and I rise to support "", H.R. 3539, "".  Every American wants to live in a safe community, and children  deserve to be able to go to safe schools. But all too often, that  safety has been ruined by violence to self or others.  The Behavioral Intervention Guidelines, or BIG, Act combats this  mental health epidemic head-on by providing local communities and  school systems with the tools they need to help identify those most in  need.  All across the country, schools like Columbus State University in my  home State of Georgia and Texas Tech in Lubbock, Texas, have  implemented behavioral intervention programs following the 2008 tragedy  at Virginia Tech.  Dr. Chip Reese at Columbus State University and other university  leaders, like Dr. Billy Phillips at Texas Tech, report that, as a  result of these programs, they have seen universities' culture change  and are helping to get at-risk students back on the right track.  This important legislation would foster this approach by providing  Federal guidance in the form of best practices. Once established, these  best practices will be disseminated on the HHS website, and HHS would  provide technical assistance for elementary, secondary, and higher  education institutions that are looking to create their own behavioral  health intervention teams.  Now more than ever, our students should have the proper resources and  a supportive community around them to benefit their mental health. I  strongly urge my colleagues to support this important piece of  legislation.    "
