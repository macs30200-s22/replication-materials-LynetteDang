Jeff Merkley,2.418256998062134,D," Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I wish to state for the record that  although an important engagement in Oregon kept me from being present  in the Capitol to participate in the cloture vote on this year's  National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, I would have voted nay had I  been present.  I am pleased that the NDAA would phase out the reduction of survivor  benefit plan annuities to ensure that the families of our fallen  servicemembers receive the Federal support they need and deserve; would  guarantee 12 weeks of paid family leave for Federal employees; fence  funds for the introduction of new Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces,  INF; limit nuclear cooperation agreements under section 123 of the U.S.  Atomic Energy Act with countries that lack safeguards; and support the  legally-binding and verifiable limits of the New START Treaty as being  in the national security interest of the United States. However, other  aspects of the bill are cause for serious concern, outweighing these  strong points, and must not be overlooked.  I am deeply concerned by this legislation's failure to prohibit funds  for unauthorized war with Iran. There is no doubt that war with Iran  would be a reckless, disastrous mistake. Yet the President has made a  number of impulsive, provocative public statements that risk escalating  tensions. Congress must protect its authority to declare war, and that  means no blank checks to the administration for an unauthorized war  with Iran.  It is also unthinkable that the final NDAA does not prohibit funds  for intelligence support to the Saudi-led coalition in a war that has  caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Communities have  crumbled as a result of this conflict, and an acute cholera outbreak  and famine have killed more than 85,000 children under the age of 5.  The United States has no place supporting, prolonging, or being  complicit in this war's widespread civilian casualties.  In addition, I am concerned that the NDAA does not prohibit funds for  the deployment of a low-yield warhead on a submarine-launched ballistic  missile. The use of this powerful and aggressive tool could drastically  increase the risk of instigating a destabilizing nuclear arms race. [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S7090"">Page S7090</a>, ]  Here at home, the final NDAA conference report removed provisions to  address PFAS water contamination. More than 16 million Americans  currently drink water contaminated with PFAS chemicals, which can  affect every major organ in the human body and put humans at higher  risk of a wide variety of health conditions and complications including  liver and kidney damage and thyroid disease. The decision to reject  remedies to this urgent public health issue in the NDAA is deeply  disturbing and completely unacceptable.  Finally, this NDAA does not include adequate safeguards to ensure  accountability for wasteful defense spending. At a time when America  far outspends every other nation in the world militarily, while working  families are grappling with stagnant wages and rising costs of living,  it could not be more important that the Pentagon and its contractors  are accountable to American taxpayers. We should be doing far more to  scrutinize defense spending and to evaluate whether we could maintain a  strong military while redirecting badly needed funding to the American  people's priorities on health care, housing, education, and  infrastructure.  Mr. President, I wish to state once again that I would have voted nay  had I been present. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues  to resolve these critical issues in future bills and to advance the  health, safety, and well-being of all Americans.    "
