Bernard Sanders,0.1361510008573532,R," Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I congratulate my friend and the senior  Senator from Vermont, Patrick Leahy, for casting his 16,000th vote in  the U.S. Senate. Since he was first elected in 1974, Senator Leahy has  worked tirelessly for the people of Vermont, bringing to Washington,  DC, Vermont values: a belief in justice, civic engagement, and the  importance of community. Senator Leahy has long been a champion of  human rights, a steward of the environment, and his efforts have  brought important Federal resources to our State. I join with his wife  Marcelle, his children and grandchildren, and Vermonters throughout our  State in congratulating him on this milestone vote and thanking him for  his 44 years of dedicated service. I look forward to continuing to work  together to represent the people of Vermont.    "
