Barbara Lee,1.0366603136062622,D," Mr. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, let me also say how important it  is that we really understand and recognize that this is a global  pandemic and it knows no borders.  This bill will also ramp up testing, contact tracing, and outreach to  ensure that those communities most impacted are supported. It  strengthens outreach to medically underserved communities. Again, Black  and Brown and indigenous people have suffered the most from COVID.  This bill will ensure that the testing and tracing efforts treat  people of color as partners in engaging their communities.  This is a health and economic pandemic of enormous proportions that  we have never experienced in our lifetime. We must make sure that  people have safe places to work and attend school. Their health and  economic needs are addressed in this bill. We cannot have one without  the other.  So let's pass this comprehensive relief. Let's begin to try to heal  our country. Please support this bill, and I ask for an ``aye'' vote.    "
