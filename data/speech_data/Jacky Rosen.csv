Jacky Rosen,0.7565169930458069,D," Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I stand here today in opposition to the  nomination of Lawrence VanDyke to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in  Nevada, and I stand here today because I think we can all agree--no  matter where you are from--that Federal judges in our States should  come from our communities, and they should reflect our communities.  It is unfortunate to see this Chamber disregard Nevada's voice and  move forward with Mr. VanDyke's nomination. The State of Nevada has  numerous qualified lawyers and judges who have done good work and have  good reputations in our communities, who are nonpartisan, and who would  make excellent additions to the Ninth Circuit. But the White House  didn't nominate any of these qualified individuals for the Ninth  Circuit. Instead, the President nominated Lawrence VanDyke, a man who  wasn't born in Nevada, didn't grow up in Nevada, didn't go to school in  Nevada, and doesn't live in Nevada now. He hasn't even set foot in  Nevada for over a year.  This administration has nominated someone to serve on the Nevada seat  of the Ninth Circuit who--and let me be clear--is not a Nevadan. Mr.  VanDyke is, however, a Washington, DC, lawyer and failed political  candidate from Montana who was nominated to further his and this  administration's extreme political views.  His nomination is being imposed on the people of Nevada, despite the  many qualified individuals in our own State--individuals who are  respected on both sides of the aisle.  As if Mr. VanDyke's lack of any meaningful connection to the State of  Nevada wasn't enough, Mr. VanDyke is not even qualified to hold this  post, according to the American Bar Association. In reviewing this  nominee and speaking with dozens upon dozens of his former colleagues,  the ABA found Mr. VanDyke specifically ``not qualified'' to serve in  this role. The ABA has made that finding for only 3 percent of  President Trump's judicial nominees, and Mr. VanDyke is the first in a  small group whose nomination will move forward without--let me repeat:  without--the support of either Senator representing the State where he  will sit on the bench if confirmed. That we would allow someone who is  not qualified to hold a lifetime position in such a critically  important role is, frankly, absurd, and it is something no Senator  should support, no matter the party of the President who nominated  them.  The ABA's report found Mr. VanDyke to be lacking in knowledge of day- to-day practice, including procedural rules. The report found Mr.  VanDyke to be lacking humility and an open [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S6920"">Page S6920</a>, ] mind, and the ABA's report found Mr. VanDyke to be lacking a commitment  to the truth.  In order to see how the ABA came to this conclusion, one only needs  to look at Mr. VanDyke's record of pursuing an ideological agenda  instead of working for the people and defending the law. In his past  role as attorney general of Montana, he filed many politically driven  briefs, including one asking the Supreme Court to strike down Roe v.  Wade altogether, a view that is out of step with the views of Nevadans.  He even signed the State onto one brief without reading it, by his own  admission.  Mr. VanDyke has also made controversial and appalling statements  about LGBTQ Americans, writing this: ``[There is] ample reason for  concern that same-sex marriage will hurt families, and consequentially  children and society.''  Mr. VanDyke was given every opportunity to disavow this statement and  repeatedly declined to do so. Allowing Mr. VanDyke to serve on the  Ninth Circuit would put at risk the rights of thousands of LGBTQ  Americans to employment, healthcare, housing, and basic equal treatment  in what is often the court of last resort.  Surely you must agree, no matter who is President or who controls the  Senate, you would want qualified judges with connections to the State  who will be fair to your constituents and not use cases to advance  their personal ideological agenda.  I oppose the nomination of Mr. VanDyke, and if it is withdrawn or  voted down, I will be ready at a moment's notice to work with this  White House in finding a fair, qualified, and nonpartisan nominee from  Nevada. The people of my home State and yours deserve nothing less.  I yield the floor.    "
