Patrick McHenry,0.6255089044570923,R," Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report  to the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2021.  Combating illicit finance and targeting bad actors is a nonpartisan  issue. However, Congress' actions must be thoughtful and data-driven.  An example of this is "", H.R. 2514, "", the COUNTER Act, which is included  in this conference report. Division G is a compilation of bipartisan  policies that will modernize and reform the Bank Secrecy Act and anti- money laundering regimes. These policies will strengthen the Department  of Treasury's financial intelligence, anti-money laundering, and  counter terrorism programs. I would like to thank Chairman Cleaver and  Ranking Member Stivers for their work on this bill and the language  included in Division G.  In addition to Division G, the conference report contains an  amendment replacing the text of "", H.R. 2513, ', the Corporate Transparency  Act, with new legislation. ', H.R. 2513, ', which passed the House on October  22, 2019, and again as an amendment to ', H.R. 6395, "" on July 21, 2020,  attempted to establish a new beneficial ownership information reporting  regime to assist law enforcement in tracking down terrorists and other  bad actors who finance terrorism and illicit activities. But, it did so  to the detriment of America's small businesses.  Beneficial ownership information is the personally identifiable  information (PII) on a company's beneficial owners. This information is  currently collected and held by financial institutions prior to a  company gaining access to our financial system.  However, bad actors and nation states, such as China and Russia, are  becoming more proficient in using our financial system to support  illicit activity. As bad actors become more sophisticated, so to must  our tools to deter and catch them. One such tool is identifying the  beneficial owners of shell companies, which are used as fronts to  launder money and finance terrorism or other illicit activity.  Beneficial ownership information assists law enforcement to better  target these bad actors.  Although well-intentioned, "", H.R. 2513, ' had numerous deficiencies in its  reporting regime. First, ', H.R. 2513, "" placed numerous reporting and costly  reporting requirements on small businesses. It lacked protections to  properly protect small businesses' personal information stored with a  little-known government office within the Department of Treasury--known  as FinCEN. The bill authorized access to this sensitive information  without any limitation on who could access the information and when it  could be accessed. Finally, it failed to hold FinCEN accountable for  its actions.  The text of "", H.R. 2513, ' is replaced with new language that I  negotiated, along with Senate Banking Committee Chairman Crapo. This  substitute, which is reflected in Division F of the conference report,  is a significant improvement over the House-passed bill in three key  areas.  First, Division F limits the burdens on small businesses. Unlike ', H.R. 2513, "", the language included in the conference report protects our  nation's small businesses. It prevents duplicative, burdensome, and  costly reporting requirements for beneficial ownership data from being  imposed in two ways. It rescinds the current beneficial ownership  reporting regime set out in 31 CFR 1010.230 (b)-(j), which is costly  and burdensome to small businesses. Rescinding these provisions ensures  that it cannot be used in a future rule to impose another duplicative,  reporting regime on America's small businesses. In addition, Division F  requires the Department of Treasury to minimize the burdens the new  reporting regime will have on small businesses, including eliminating  any duplicative requirements.  House Republicans ensured the directive to minimize burdens on small  businesses is fulfilled. Division F directs the Secretary of the  Treasury to report to the House Committee on Financial Services and the  Senate Committee on Banking annually for the first three years after  the new rule is promulgated. The report must assess: the effectiveness  of the new rule; the steps the Department of Treasury [["", Page , H6933, ] took to minimize the reporting burdens on reporting entities, including  eliminating duplicative reporting requirements, and the accuracy of the  new rule in targeting bad actors. The Department of Treasury is also  required to identify the alternate procedures and standards that were  considered and rejected in developing its new reporting regime. This  report will help the Committees understand the effectiveness of the new  rule in identifying and prosecuting bad actors. Moreover, it will give  the Committees the data needed to understand whether the reporting  threshold is sufficient or should be revised.  Second, Division F includes the strongest privacy and disclosure  protections for America's small businesses as it relates to the  collection, maintenance, and disclosure of beneficial ownership  information. The new protections set out in Division F ensure that  small business beneficial ownership information will be protected just  like an individual's tax return information. The protections in  Division F mirror or exceed the protections set out in 26 U.S.C. 6103,  including:  1. Agency Head Certification. Division F requires an agency   head or designee to certify that an investigation or law   enforcement, national security or intelligence activity is   authorized and necessitates access to the database. Designees   may only be identified through a process that mirrors the   process followed by the Department of Treasury for those   designations set out in 26 U.S.C. 6103.  2. Semi-annual Certification of Protocols. Division F   requires an Agency head to make a semi-annual certification   to the Secretary of the Treasury that the protocols for   accessing small business ownership data ensure maximum   protection of this critically important information. This   requirement is non-delegable.  3. Court authorization of State, Local and Tribal law   enforcement requests. Division F requires state, local and   tribal law enforcement officials to obtain a court   authorization from the court system in the local   jurisdiction. Obtaining a court authorization is the first of   two steps state, local and tribal governments must take prior   to accessing the database. Separately, state, local and   tribal law enforcement agencies must comply with the   protocols and safeguards established by the Department of   Treasury.  4. Limited Disclosure of Beneficial Ownership Information.   Division F prohibits the Secretary of Treasury from   disclosing the requested beneficial ownership information to   anyone other than a law enforcement or national security   official who is directly engaged in the investigation.  5. System of Records. Division F requires any requesting   agency to establish and maintain a system of records to store   beneficial ownership information provided directly by the   Secretary of the Treasury.  6. Penalties for Unauthorized Disclosure. Division F   prohibits unauthorized disclosures. Specifically, the   agreement reiterates that a violation of appropriate   protocols, including unauthorized disclosure or use, is   subject to criminal and civil penalties (up to five years in   prison and $250,000 fine).  Third, Division F contains the necessary transparency, accountability  and oversight provisions to ensure that the Department of Treasury  promulgates and implements the new beneficial ownership reporting  regime as intended by Congress. Specifically, Division F requires each  requesting agency to establish and maintain a permanent, auditable  system of records describing: each request, how the information is  used, and how the beneficial ownership information is secured. It  requires requesting agencies to furnish a report to the Department of  Treasury describing the procedures in place to ensure the  confidentiality of the beneficial ownership information provided  directly by the Secretary of the Treasury.  Separately, Division F requires two additional audits. First, it  directs the Secretary of Treasury to conduct an annual audit to  determine whether beneficial ownership information is being collected,  stored and used as intended by Congress. Separately, Division F directs  the Government Accountability Office to conduct an audit for five years  to ensure that the Department of Treasury and requesting agencies are  using the beneficial ownership information as set out in Division F.  This is the same audit that GAO conducts as it relates to the  Department of Treasury's collection, maintenance and protection of tax  return information. This information will ensure that Congress has  independent data on the efficacy of the reporting regime and whether  confidentiality is being maintained.  Division F also requires the Department of Treasury to issue an  annual report on the total number of court authorized requests received  by the Secretary to access the database. The report must detail the  total number of court authorized requests approved and rejected and a  summary justifying the action. This report to Congress will ensure the  Department of Treasury does not misuse its authority to either approve  or reject court authorized requests.  Finally, Division F requires the Director of FinCEN, who is  responsible for implementing this reporting regime, to testify annually  for five years. This testimony is critical. For far too long FinCEN has  evaded any type of congressional check on its activities. Yet, it has  amassed a great deal of authority. Now, Congress will shine a light on  its operations. It is my expectation that FinCEN will provide Congress  with hard data on its effectiveness in targeting bad actors, including  the effectiveness of this new authority to collect, maintain, and use  beneficial ownership information.  One final comment about the importance of FinCEN's annual testimony.  In the months leading up to the House's consideration of "", H.R. 2513, ' last  October, I sought data from FinCEN and from the Treasury Department,  along with the Department of Justice, to better understand the need for  this legislation. No such data was forthcoming. Rather, FinCEN gave  anecdotes of very scary stories to justify the need for a new reporting  regime. It is my expectation that FinCEN will provide Congress with the  necessary data to justify this new reporting regime and the burdens it  is placing on legitimate companies.  I will conclude by thanking Chairwoman Maloney for her work over the  last twelve years on this issue and her willingness to work with me to  strengthen this bill. I believe we have a better product.  I urge my colleagues to support the conference agreement.    "
