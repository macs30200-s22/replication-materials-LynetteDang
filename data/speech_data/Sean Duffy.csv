Sean Duffy,0.2415789067745208,R," Mr. DUFFY. Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from Wisconsin for  yielding tonight.  Madam Speaker, I have got to tell you, it is a pretty unique and cool  feeling to stand in this well and hold onto this podium for the last  time. What an honor it is to serve in this House and stand in this  Chamber.  I want to take a moment, as I give my last address to the House, to  thank my constituents who have put so much faith in me that they would  give me the opportunity--a guy from small town Wisconsin, from Hayward,  Wisconsin, who had a big family and grew up doing lumberjack sports--to  come here and represent them. And they have done that five times, five  times over.  I would just note that they have been so kind to me, whether they  agreed with me or not. Whether I was at a townhall or a Lincoln Day  dinner or a dairy breakfast or a parade or affair, the kindness that  has come from my constituents as I have done my best to serve their  interests could not fill my heart with greater pride and joy to  represent the good people of Wisconsin's Seventh Congressional  District, which is the central, northern, and western part of our great  State.  But, as many of us will tell you, I don't think our Founders ever  envisioned that to come to this Chamber should be a lifetime sentence.  We are supposed to come, be citizen legislators, serve our time, and  then step aside and let someone else step forward and do the good work.  And, in news reports, as I have announced that I was going to step  aside, people will say, ``Sean Duffy's seat.'' Well, I think we should  correct that. It is not my seat. It was not my predecessor's seat. It  is the people's seat, and they get to choose every 2 years--well, now,  this is going to be 8 months in--a new Congressman to represent them.  It is the people's seat. It is not mine. It is theirs. So, I thank the  Seventh District.  I want to say thanks to my fellow colleagues and Members of Congress  on both sides of the aisle. We get a bad rap in this Chamber where  people will tell us: You guys are so dysfunctional. You guys can't get  along. You guys can't get anything done.  There is some truth to that. There is a lot of bickering; there is a  lot of fighting; and, yes, sometimes we don't get a lot done. But I  will just tell you this, that people get along a lot better across the  aisle than might meet the eye on some of the major news networks.  Though it might not be on tax reform or immigration reform, there is  a lot of legislation that we work on together, on which we try to find  bipartisan compromise that can not just pass our committees, but can  pass the House and can get our dysfunctional friends in the Senate to  actually pick up and pass so we can get it to the President's desk. It  happens a lot.  The Chamber, I think, though it is going through some difficult  times, we are actually working, and I am proud of that.  I am proud to serve with my ranking member, Patrick McHenry, who has  been so kind and generous to me. I have actually enjoyed serving with  Maxine Waters.  Some of the subcommittee chairs and ranking members like Al Green and  Lacy Clay and Emanuel Cleaver have become good friends of mine, and I  honor their friendship and am grateful for it. But sometimes,  oftentimes, we work better than we are given credit for.  I want to take a second, because I think this is such an important  part of the debate that we are having today, and talk about American  capitalism. I mean, American capitalism is the American model. It has  been our American way that has brought us more opportunity, more  prosperity, more upward mobility, more innovation, more creativity,  more generosity than any other country that has existed on the face of  the Earth.  Part of that American capitalist system is an idea not that we have  no government, but that we have limited government, and not that we  have no taxes, but we have limited taxes. What you saw over 2 years of  a Republican-led majority in the House and the Senate with a Republican  President is we did those things. And the net end result was what we  thought it would be: We put people back to work.  When I ran the first time 9 years ago, we had people who couldn't  find jobs, families who were suffering. I heard, all the time, families  say: I wish we had a better economy, because I want my kids to be able  to stay in our hometown and get a job in our hometown and raise their  family in our hometown so we can have an extended family, but they have  to leave. They have to go to Milwaukee or Minneapolis or Chicago or  Wausau or somewhere else to get a job, but they can't stay here.  {time} 1945  But today, after we have implemented these reforms, it is profound  what is happening. People are going back to work. In Wisconsin, our  wages are up, and unemployment is down. We have more jobs in Wisconsin  than we have people to fill those jobs. That is a success story of  American capitalism. I am proud of that.  Though everybody may not agree that it has been those policies that  have created it--some of those are on the left--when they dig deep in  their heart, they can't deny that what we have done has made their  lives better.  And so often we have, in my district, it has been the forgotten men  and women, men and women who feel like people come to this Chamber, to  this town, and they engage in debates that are irrelevant; debates that  don't make their lives better; debates that don't improve their  economy. Maybe it is a debate that might improve the coasts or global  corporations, but it is a debate that doesn't help their rural, small- town community.  They have seen, over the last few years, that their voices have been  heard; their pain has been heard, and it has been addressed. And for  that, they are incredibly grateful.  When you shop at Walmart and you have a hard time figuring out where  you are going to get the dollars to pay your mortgage, or how you are  going to send your kids to school, and if you lose your job, then it  all collapses; and in today's market, they look and go, This is really  great. This has improved so much. We couldn't be more grateful for the  economy and the system that has offered this prosperity that we now  feel.  I am troubled that, even though we have had the success of a free  enterprise system, an American capitalist system, we now have a debate  in this Chamber where people want to go a different model, right?  We have a debate saying we want to go to socialism. Socialism should  be the model of America's future; and that the promise of socialism,  where we can all be equal, and we can all get free stuff, if we can  just tax the rich a little bit more and give a little bit more to you,  it is going to be a beautiful economy.  Those promises have been made throughout human history, and those  promises always fail. Whether you want to go to the old Soviet Union,  whether you want to go to Venezuela, or Cuba, it never works.  This country actually fought socialism in Europe. We fought socialism  in our universities. Now we are fighting socialism in the halls of  Congress?  We can't lose this fight, because if we lose this fight, we lose our  future. And if you lose the future, you don't leave enough to your  kids.  So I hope that this Chamber will recalibrate and think through what  the best economic model is to continue with that prosperity, continue  with that opportunity for our kids and for our next generation.  But as we talk about maybe equality and opportunity, I do think there  is a really important point: As the socialist talks about the equality  of the outcome, I think our model has been the equality of opportunity. [["", Page , H7830, ]  When I look at communities in America, and communities in Wisconsin,  and you can look at a zip code of that community, and you will be able  to recognize the opportunity and the poverty of the kids that are being  raised in those communities, by their zip code, because of the school  system they have in place in those communities in those zip codes.  That is a travesty. That is not equal opportunity. That has given a  group of kids the short end of the stick.  So, as I have been in this Chamber, I have fought for school choice.  Because if you are a parent and you have a child and you have a failing  school, you should have the opportunity to get out of your failing  school and go to a school that is going to give you the skill sets and  the tools to take advantage of the American economy. You should have  that right. You should have that option. And that is school choice.  I would love it if we could make the schools better in these  communities, and we should fight to do that. But these kids can't wait.  So I hope the fight for school choice continues.  I have fought in this Chamber for free trade, but I have also fought  with our President for fair trade. And when we have people who take  advantage of this economy, of my constituents, and say it is free  trade, well, free trade isn't free trade if it is not fair trade. And I  couldn't support the President more in his fight against China to make  sure that we have a fair system with their growing economy. And it is  not easy.  I look in this Chamber. Oftentimes there is not a lot of political  courage, but you have a President who, one of the greatest things he  has going for him is the great economy; and he is willing to jeopardize  this great economy, to risk the great economy and engage in a trade  conflict with China, not to help him in the next election, but to help  American kids in the next 10, 15, 20 years.  That is what real leaders do. That is what courage is in a leader,  and that is what our President has done on this trade fight; risking  the economy for the kids and our future, to make sure we are still the  number one economy and the number one military.  One of the great issues I am proud to have fought on is the issue of  life. I don't think that there is anyone who is more vulnerable, more  voiceless than the unborn; and to have been in this Chamber, and to  have been able to lend my voice to those who don't have one has been an  amazing honor.  I think that this will be a scourge at this time period in American  history, and we have had these time periods in our past, that we  haven't stood up and fought what science tells us, as you look at a 4D  ultrasound, what that baby is in the womb.  I am on the right side of history to have fought for the millions of  little babies who have lost their lives over the course of the last 40- plus years. And I hope this Chamber one day can see that life does  begin at conception; that we shouldn't be having a debate about late- term, partial-birth abortion. We shouldn't be having a debate about how  we allowed children to die more comfortably after they are born; that  that is outrageous. It is, frankly disgusting. We should get that  right.  As I close my final remarks from this well, I want to thank my team.  Any Member of Congress, anyone who serves in this institution can't  do it without great people with them, great people surrounding them,  fighting--not with them personally, but fighting on the issues with  them. It doesn't work without them.  Over the course of the last 8\\1/2\\ years, I have had the most  remarkable team to serve with me and work with me. And though they have  worked for me, they are some of my best friends who have stood with me,  and I couldn't be more grateful that they have come into my life and  come into my district and our community; and not just fought so hard  with me, but fought so hard for the people that I represent to make  sure their issues are covered, to make sure that their voices were  heard.  They helped me amplify my constituents' voices, and I want to thank  Pete and the D.C. team, specifically, and Jesse and the district team  for their endless efforts. My constituents were well served by them, so  thank you.  Finally, I want to thank my family. When I started, I didn't have as  many kids. Actually, I had Patrick and Margarita and Mari V and Paloma,  who didn't know their father at any point other than as a Congressman.  But some of my older kids were well aware of what we did before.  My oldest daughter, Evita, we did our first parade together, and I  was terrified. I was terrified to do a parade, and this little 9-year  old girl came out with me with the most courage.  All of them have stood with me and worked with me and campaigned with  me. It has been a family endeavor.  Anyone who runs, they know the sacrifice that their families go  through. My family has been great, going to parades, and going--in  Wisconsin we do dairy breakfasts--going to dairy breakfasts. And they  have been there supporting me and working with me, and I couldn't be  more grateful for them.  As their dad comes out to Congress 4 days a week, I am not there as  much, and they have supported me through this whole effort, this whole  adventure. A dad can't do that unless he has kids who support him. So,  to all of them, from Lucia, to Evita, to Patrick, and John Paul, and  Margarita, and Mari V, and Paloma, and Jack, I want to thank you all  for the support you have given me.  Finally, I want to thank my wife, I would not be here without her.  When I ran, everyone said I could never make it to this Chamber. I  could never win. And she was the one who said, No, I think you can. I  think you can represent these people, your people well. And we did it  together.  When I am here, as every spouse who has someone who comes here, she  was the one who held up our house. She was a single mom, and we have 8  kids. She was a single mom with 8 kids. And you have to be incredibly  dedicated and devoted and passionate about what we do in this Chamber  if you are going to be a single mom with 8 kids and let your husband go  off and fight the great fight of the day.  So I want to tell her how much I love her and how grateful I am that  she has supported my dream to come here and fight the good fight.  When I won on my first night, on election night, I said that the  battle for America's future is a fight against socialism. It is a  battle to return our Nation to the principles that made America  different, that made America better, that made America great. I think  that couldn't be more true today.  And with me and Rachel, and my team, and my kids, I couldn't be more  grateful that they have stood with me to help engage in that fight.  So for the final time, as I step out of this well with a grateful,  and it might not be obvious, but a happy heart, I want to thank my  colleagues for their friendship.  I want to thank the great State of Wisconsin for their trust.  I want to thank my whole family for their support. I want to thank  God for his blessings, and for this opportunity and for the wisdom to  know when my time is up.    "
