Nydia Velazquez,3.015110969543457,D," Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this relief  bill because the American people cannot wait another day.  Over 315,000 Americans are dead. Three out of every 4 small  businesses have seen their revenues fall, and thousands have shut their  doors for good.  Food insecurity has doubled for families with children, and millions  of Americans are turning to food banks for the first time.  In most states, 1 in 5 households are behind on rent. More than 10  million people are unemployed.  But it's been over six months since the House passed the Heroes Act,  comprehensive legislation to address these issues months ago.  And all this time, Republicans have refused to lift a finger to  provide relief to struggling families. It is shameful that it took this  long for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to come to the  table.  And let me be clear--$600 in direct payments and an additional $300  per week in unemployment is not enough--in fact, it's just half of the  aid that we passed in the CARES Act.  So, while I am disappointed in my Republican colleagues and recognize  this bill is not ideal or as comprehensive as the Heroes Act-it will  provide some much-needed relief to the American people until we can  pass a more robust stimulus under the Biden Administration.  I'd particularly like to thank all the staff from member offices, to  committee offices, to leadership and floor staff, who worked long hours  and through the weekend to help put this package together.  For small businesses, this bill takes action to authorize a second  round of PPP loans to the hardest hit businesses. Importantly, it will  set aside funding reserved for small businesses with 10 or fewer  employees and those in underserved communities. It also utilizes small  banks and mission-based community lenders to guarantee fair access to  small employers.  And finally, this bill provides for what we have been hearing on the  ground from small [["", Page , H7312, ] businesses--the need for cash infusions through grants. By establishing  new guardrails and allocating $20 billion to the EIDL grant program, we  are targeting the hardest hit small businesses to receive these grants.  Meanwhile, as shuttered entertainment venues, including our cultural  institutions and movie theaters, that depend on large crowds to survive  have been closed by the pandemic and faced difficulties accessing PPP  and other SBA programs, this bill creates a new $15 billion dollar  grant program to target these establishments that have experienced a  dramatic decline in revenue.  But our efforts do not end here. We will continue to seek more  assistance next year because Main Street, especially our independent  restaurants, and working families deserve for us to come back to the  table to provide a lifeline while we await vaccine distributions.  So today, I'm voting yes but I urge my fellow members, let's not stop  here. Let's come back in January and pass more relief for the American  people.    "
