Marcy Kaptur,0.5755645036697388,D," Mr. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure today that I rise  in support of strong, bipartisan passage of the Butch Lewis Act.  The Butch Lewis Act will provide the economic security this body  ripped out from under millions of hardworking Americans.  Across our country, 1.3 million workers and retirees face serious and  significant threat of cuts to their hard earned multiemployer pension  plans, through no fault of their own. Several of these plans are large  enough to take down the entire Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation,  threatening the guaranteed security of 10 million Americans.  I have heard the message time and again from retirees in my district  and across this nation: they worked for decades to earn these pensions.  Now they are too old, or their health too unstable, to return to the  workforce. The stress and anxiety are sapping their will. Some have  taken their own lives.  The Butch Lewis Act will provide much needed and long-overdue relief.  The Butch Lewis Act keeps the promises made to retirees. It  guarantees pension benefits they have earned into the future. It does  so by allowing troubled pension plans to borrow the money needed to  remain solvent in 30-year, low interest loans. The plan will repay.  Pensions-have afforded millions of middle-class Americans the  opportunity to enjoy their golden years with economic peace of mind.  Let us restore this peace with swift and just passage of the Butch  Lewis Act.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired.  Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. David P. Roe of Tennessee  Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at  the desk.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:  Amend section 4(b)(2) to read as follows:  (2) Interest rate.--Loans made under subsection (a) shall   have an interest rate of 5 percent for each of the first 5   years and 9 percent thereafter.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to "", House Resolution 509, "", the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. David P. Roe) and a Member opposed each  will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.  Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.  One talking point that I have heard a lot from my friends across the  aisle in support of this bill is that Congress has already bailed out  our Nation's financial institutions so we should bail out the pension  plans.  While I don't agree with that sentiment, if that is the argument,  then we should treat these bailouts the same. Using this logic, my  amendment would set the loan interest rates in the bill at 5 percent  for the first 5 years and 9 percent after that, the same rate given to  banks under the Troubled Asset Relief Program.  While I wasn't in Congress at the time TARP was passed, the situation  we are in today, considering a union pension bailout, is the best  evidence of why we shouldn't have interfered with a bailout of our  private financial institutions. Nevertheless, that decision was made,  and now one bailout is being used to justify another. If we believe  Congress should be in the business of bailing out privately negotiated,  collectively bargained benefit arrangements of private employers, we  should do so using the same terms as TARP.  A key feature of TARP was the Capital Purchase Program, which  provided capital to finance institutions by purchasing senior preferred  shares. My amendment would set the interest rate of loans authorized  under this bill to the same rate that senior preferred stock dividends  paid under TARP's Capital Purchase Program. If these terms were good  enough for the TARP bailout, they should be good enough for the bailout  offered by this bill.  The majority refuses to accept the outrageous risk associated with  making loans in these plans. Instead, this bill offers low-interest  loans to massively underfunded, failing pension plans and allows loan  principal forgiveness if the plans can't be repaid. This is  unbelievable. This proves the majority has no belief that the loans  will ever be repaid and is simply looking to gift hundreds of billions  of dollars of taxpayer funds to these failing pension plans.  What about the retirement plans affected during the same time? What  are we going to bail out next? Are we going to continue having the  Federal Government come along and throw money at badly managed  investments?  If we do make these loans, the government shouldn't just throw the  money at a problem without some guardrails. With TARP, banks were not  given low-interest loans over 30 years and told it really doesn't  matter if they repay them or not, that we will forgive them anyway. In  fact, those loans were repaid, and the government made money doing  that.  Mr. Speaker, having said that, I served as chairman of the Health,  Employment, Labor, and Pension Subcommittee for 6 years. I worked on  the bill with Chairman Kline and Ranking Member Miller to help solve  this problem. It is a huge problem.  My father was a union member who lost his job 30 years after World  War II, so I have been down that road with my own family.  I am willing to work across the aisle. As Mr. Neal stated, I was on  that committee that didn't do anything. I am willing now to work on  this.  This bill, I disagree with him, is not going anywhere. The PBGC  chairman today said that we should work in a bipartisan way, and I am  sitting here today telling the gentleman that I am willing to do that.  I have been willing to for the past 6 years. We did pass that bill back  about 4 years ago, which will help with the plans, so I am willing to  do that. This plan is not it.  I urge support of my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    "
