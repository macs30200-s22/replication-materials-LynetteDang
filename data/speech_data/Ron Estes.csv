Ron Estes,0.0695809498429298,R," Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friend, Mr. Lamborn,  for holding this special hour.  For our Nation's Founding Fathers, the Bible was a guiding light and  provided them the wisdom to build a strong foundation for the United  States, a nation that recognizes and protects our God-given rights.  The teachings in the Bible are intertwined with American beliefs and  values, showing us truth, sacrifice, and compassion for others.  In Isaiah 45:13, God called on Cyrus to bring freedom to His people.  He says:  I have raised them up in righteousness, and I will direct   all his ways; he shall rebuild My city and let My exiles go   free, not for price nor reward.  Just as God called upon Cyrus centuries ago, He calls each of us to  serve Him and our fellow man. Not only that, but God equips us with His  Word and His Holy Spirit.  We serve Him by advocating for the weakest among us and giving a  voice to the voiceless. We do this in His name, not for reward, but out  of love for our fellow man. That servant attitude should be followed,  whether you are a Member of Congress, a farmer, or a machinist on a  manufacturing line.  I am so grateful for His calling in my life and for His Word that is  a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.    "
