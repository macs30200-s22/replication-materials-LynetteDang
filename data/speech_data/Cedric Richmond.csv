Cedric Richmond,1.4765287637710571,D," Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, let me say that the goal of the bill is  positive, but how it is achieved is just flat wrong. [["", Page , H3650, ]  To pay for this legislation, what we do is go straight to Alabama,  Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas and take $1.9 billion a year of  potential revenue to those States to uplift their people to pay for  this bill.  Let me be specific about Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana. They  rank 48th, 49th, and 50th in terms of quality of life for their  residents. They rank 1, 2, and 5 in terms of their African-American  population.  So, what are we doing here, in this time of racial inequity? We are  going to Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana and taking $1.9 billion a  year without sharing any of that revenue with their States where: they  can improve education, where all three rank last; they can improve  healthcare, where all three States rank last; and they can improve  their environment, where all three States are in the bottom one-third.  So, all I am saying is, at some point, equity demands that those  States get their fair share.    "
