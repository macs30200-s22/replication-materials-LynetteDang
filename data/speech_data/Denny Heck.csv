Denny Heck,1.341708064079285,D," Mr. HECK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on this floor for the  last time. My purpose is to convey two simple thoughts: first, an  expression of gratitude, foremost to my wife, Paula--we are newlyweds;  we have only been married 44 years--and to my two sons. Their support  has been the only reason that I have been able to do this.  I have been absent. I am sorry. I promise to do better.  Thank you as well to my staff. Every Member here knows we ain't  nothing without them. We are just the ornament on the hood of the car,  and they are the engine. They have both my undying love and gratitude.  Thank you to my colleagues. My life is enriched, and I am a better  person for having known you.  And a very special callout to my dear, dear friend, albeit messy  roommate, and an outstanding legislator, Derek Kilmer.  Last, thank you to the people of the 10th Congressional District of  Washington, whom I affectionately but sincerely refer to as my bosses.  You sent me here to represent a newly created congressional district.  It has truly been my privilege. Thank you.  Second, a plea, a plea to all those who follow here: Please, please  work to nurture this institution. Institutions sustain us, be they our  houses of worship for our faith or this secular equivalent for our  democracy. They get us through hard times, but only if we tend to them.  Citizens in a democracy have, of course, rights and responsibilities;  Members of this institution, this body, likewise. We are all too aware  of our rights here, but it is the responsibilities that bear  emphasizing.  We have a responsibility to conduct ourselves in a civil fashion. It  is self-evident that civic discourse in America has degraded; some  would say that it has even become vulgar.  You know, it is hard to reach agreement with a colleague tomorrow  that we have character assassinated today. So let us not measure our  success in terms of the number of Twitter followers we have gathered  through emotion-charged or clever attacks. Let us not define those with  whom we disagree, even if that disagreement is profound, as ``the  other.''  We live in a pluralistic society. Part of our responsibility is to  figure out how the political Rubik's Cube comes together; getting to  ``yes'' among different and competing points of view; fashioning a  result where everyone can get up from the table, perhaps not with  everything they sought, but with enough to vote ``yes'' while still  being true to their values.  There is such a thing as principled compromise. Indeed, I believe  that principled compromise is the only way we can move forward and lift  up those around us in desperate need of our help.  Do we no longer believe that? Or did we forget it?  Where I have failed to live up to these ideals, I beg your  forgiveness. I can only promise to keep trying.  Finally, I cannot help but think of the eternal wisdom of our former  colleague, John Dingell, the longest serving Member of this Chamber in  our Nation's history. When I arrived here, every first-term Member  walked on down to where he sat and sought his advice, and he gave the  same to everyone; the same to everyone. He would look us in the eye and  say:  You have an important job--a very important job--and you   are not a very important person.  Indeed, John taught us that we do not possess power, but that we only  hold it in trust. For the privilege of holding the trust for these last  8 years, I am forever changed and forever grateful.  I am 2,300 miles out and headed home.  With that, Mr. Speaker, I permanently yield back.    "
