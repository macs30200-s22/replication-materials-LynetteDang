Angus King,0.330157995223999,R," Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, let me thank my colleague from  New York for yielding. Let me also commend Mr. Larson and Mr. Moulton  for their leadership efforts on this, and, of course, Mr. Bilirakis.  It is really a great honor to be supporting this legislation. I have  known, unfortunately, too many people who suffer from ALS.  It is 100 percent fatal. That is the reality of it.  All of us who meet advocates every year coming in to lobby us, or to  urge us to support more research funding for ALS, we realize very  quickly they may be there 1 year and 2 years, and then we never see  them again because they have died. It is a brutal neurodegenerative  neuromuscular disease, and this 5-month limit that was put on them  before they can obtain disability benefits was so unfair.  During that 5 months, the disease can progress so rapidly. The  medical costs go up. The psychological costs are there. By passing this  legislation today, we are going to provide not just financial relief  but also psychological and emotional care and relief for their families  and friends.  In New York, we always refer to this as Lou Gehrig's disease after  the famed Yankee slugger, and I am saying that as a Mets fan. Lou  Gehrig is a hero in New York. Unfortunately, as great as his baseball  record is, he is known most for the disease that ended both his career  and his life.  Let me just say also, this will be my final appearance on the House  floor speaking, the last time I speak on the House floor. I want to say  what a great honor it has been to serve for these past 28 years with  all of the Members. It has been a great privilege for me. One of the  real privileges is being able to support legislation such as this,  which is so needed and so necessary.    "
