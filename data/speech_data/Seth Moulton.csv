Seth Moulton,0.6349627375602722,D," Mr. MOULTON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut  (Mr. Larson), my friend, for yielding.  In 2014, Pete Frates told ESPN: ``At the end of the day, I want to be  the cliche game-changer. I want to be the guy who shifts everyone's  thinking and shifts where the funds are going. Selfishly, I want to  give myself a chance, but also give a lot of other people opportunities  as well.''  Today, we consider ourselves incredibly lucky because we got to know  Pete Frates.  Pete, you accomplished this mission long ago, but today's vote is  further proof that you will live forever. We are here because you were  brave enough to stand up and show the world your strength. We are here  because of your family, who continued the fight: Julie, Lucy, John,  Nancy, Jennifer, and Andrew, and the Frate-train. I am so proud of all  of you.  We are here because of the hard work of the ALS Association, I AM  ALS, and because thousands of ALS patients and their families and  caregivers followed your lead.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to pass the ALS Disability  Insurance Access Act, and let's keep fighting until we have a cure for  this devastating disease.    "
