Maria Cantwell,1.0885900259017944,D," Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from  Massachusetts, who has been a leader on this important issue of net  neutrality. I want to speak and back up what he said today about why it  is so important and that we need to fight to protect a free and open  internet, before I do, I would just like to mention that yesterday we  filed a bill dealing with trade enforcement.  The reason I bring that up is because today there is going to be a  lot of discussion about trade writ large. It is very important that in  the trade discussion, we also have trade enforcement. Much of what we  filed yesterday is what we hope to see in an agreement that is now  being unveiled, and this builds on capacity building, which is very  important. We want to make sure we have the enforcement capabilities at  USTR and now the capacity and enforcement in Mexico to make these  agreements work in the future. I look forward to discussing that with  my colleagues.  I am really here to talk about how 2 years ago, the Trump  administration, basically, with the FCC at the helm, repealed net  neutrality and put Big Cable in charge of our internet future. Despite  83 percent of all Americans and a majority of Independents, Democrats,  and Republicans supporting a free and open internet--that means making  sure they weren't charged excessive rates--the FCC chose to side with  cable companies.  Not long after, Verizon throttled the broadband service of Santa  Clara firefighters in California when they were in the midst of  fighting the massive Mendocino Complex Fire in 2018. Despite  firefighters' urgent pleas to stop [["", <a href=""/congressional-record/volume-165/senate-section/page/S6917"">Page S6917</a>, ] the throttling, Verizon refused to do so.  For those who don't understand what throttling is, we are always  concerned that without rules of the road, companies would slow down  some access to internet sites. This is so important because we don't  want an internet that is based on how much you pay for faster broadband  access.  We think that to slow down important sites like public service sites  or any sites or to base an internet on how much you pay is the wrong  direction. More importantly, we need to make sure we are policing this.  Even today, as we have no Federal agency with clear authority to adopt  hard and fast rules to keep that situation from happening again, we  need to keep fighting.  Another example is that wireless carriers have been accused of  potentially throttling subscribers to Netflix, YouTube, and Sprint and  allegedly interfering with Skype services. Again, that is another  example of why we have to keep our message about a free and open  internet no matter where we look, where we live, or where we are  accessing the internet.  It is long past time for the Senate to vote on the Save the Internet  Act--something on which our colleague from Massachusetts has been a  leader.  Our bill would restore the protections for a free and open internet  that were had by the Obama FCC in 2015, which would mean no blocking,  throttling, or paid prioritization would be allowed. The FCC would have  the flexible legal standards by which to address concerns that would  arise from these big cable companies' threats to a free and open  internet.  Again, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership-- persistent both in the House and the Senate--in stressing how important  this is.  As my colleagues know, these issues are going to be very important in  the future, not just with regard to privacy, which the Senator has also  been a leader on--and I very much appreciate that the hometown  newspaper wrote a glowing endorsement of the legislation he and I have  just recently introduced on privacy--but in understanding that in the  information age, you have to give consumers rights, that you have to  give them the right to privacy, and that you have to give them the  right to a free and open internet that is not controlled in speed and  that is not controlled by one's saying, If you pay us more, we will  give you access. This is going to be a key communication tool for the  21st century, and it needs to be open.  I thank my colleague for raising this important issue, and I will  continue to work with him and our other colleagues to make it the law  of the land.  I yield the floor.    "
