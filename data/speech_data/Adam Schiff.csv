Adam Schiff,0.9837734699249268,D," Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise to emphasize the appropriate  application and interpretation of Section 404 of the Intelligence  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, which has been included as  Division W of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021.  Section 404 was authored by Chairman Bennie Thompson of the Committee  on Homeland Security. Its essence is to establish a specialized  fellowship program related to cybersecurity and intelligence within the  Department of Homeland Security. The program is meant for certain  undergraduate students from diverse racial, ethnic, cultural, and other  backgrounds. And the Secretary of Homeland Security--who shall  administer Section 404--also will have authority to hire successful  fellowship participants as Department employees, and into positions  involving cyber or intelligence.  The broader and most compelling goal being, of course, to ensure that  the Department and the Federal government are doing their utmost to  recruit, hire and retain a highly diverse workforce. The language of  Section 404 must be interpreted and implemented by the Department  broadly, with a mind towards attainment of this lawful objective; under  no circumstances should it be read in an inappropriately narrow or  needlessly restrictive fashion.  Although Section 404 does not require that students attend  Historically Black Colleges or Universities or Minority-Serving  Institutions in order to participate in the fellowship program, the  Secretary of Homeland Security--who will administer this authority-- should make extensive efforts to promote the fellowship among students  from HBCUs and MSIs.  Together with the other Members of the Homeland Security and  Intelligence Committees, I will look forward to receiving the report  required by Section 404, which will permit Congress to confirm that, in  fact, the Department is conducting the necessary outreach to HBCUs,  MSIs, and other Institutions of Higher Education; and, consistent with  the approach I have set forth here, reading and applying Section 404's  language in a manner that fulfills the initiative's overarching goal.
