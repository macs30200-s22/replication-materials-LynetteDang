Debbie Stabenow,0.1169300004839897,D," Mr. STABENOW. Mr. President, I want to take one other moment just to  also speak and thank everybody that is involved at this point in  getting us to where we are on this very important survival package.  I have never felt this was a COVID stimulus. It is about helping  people survive over the next several months, whether that is making  sure they have a roof over their head and food on the table, can pay  the bills, keep the heat on. In places like North Dakota and places  like Ohio, it is going to get pretty cold this winter. Our small  businesses, our farmers, our schools that need help to be able to  succeed, all the support we need to provide for vaccine distribution  and healthcare, and all of the other areas--this has been a tough  negotiation.  I do want to say, on a couple of points where I have been deeply  involved, I want to thank the Presiding Officer for his support and  help on our nutrition and agriculture pieces. We have come together in  a very important step. It is going to allow more people to get help to  feed their families over the next several months--no small thing.  We have a hunger crisis in our country. We have people who have  donated to the food bank, worked for the food bank, and are now sitting  for hours in cars, waiting to drive up and get a box of food, in the  United States of America.  And so what we are doing as part of this package is going to be  significant to help people be able to purchase food in the grocery  store, as well as to get help in other ways--to help our seniors with  Meals on Wheels, to help our children who aren't able to eat in school  right now, and our college students who don't have the opportunity to  be on campus and get support.  So we have very significant food access and nutrition, very positive  efforts in this legislation. And for our farmers, as well, across the  country, there is significant support, as well as help in our food  chain and supply chain areas, where we have all been concerned as we  have watched those involved in the supply chain lose their markets in  restaurants and so on but not have the support and the capacity to take  that milk or take those other commodities and be able to move them over  and package them differently for consumers to go to the food bank. We  make some headway in supporting that, as well, in this legislation.  So I want to thank my colleagues. This is really the last negotiation  that Senator Roberts and I have led, as he retires this year. And it  has been, as I have said before, a great pleasure to work with him and  to be able to achieve this effort--bipartisan effort.  The one thank-you I just want to give is in a whole other area that  has been a passion of mine that I have been proud to lead with a  colleague from Missouri, Senator Roy Blunt. We have very significant  support, as well, for behavioral health services, mental health,  substance abuse services that are desperately needed and have been  amplified, and the need has been expanded even more because of what has  happened with the coronavirus.  And there is important support in this legislation, as well, and I am  grateful to be involved in pushing that forward as well.  So there is more to talk about. I know we are a little ways away from  that final vote, but I am hopeful that the coalition that was formed-- that all of us working together that brought this together and  negotiated, and my colleagues who initiated this bipartisan effort-- will find that this is a coalition we want to keep going for next year,  because there is so much more that we need to do together, and the  American people expect us to get things done. And this, I hope, is the  first step of many to celebrate ways that we are solving problems and  helping people and moving the country forward.  Thank you, Mr. President.    "
