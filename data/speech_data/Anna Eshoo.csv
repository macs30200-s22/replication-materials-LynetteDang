Anna Eshoo,1.898498773574829,D," Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 that funds our government and  provides desperately needed relief to American families. I'm proud to  support many of the provisions in this legislation, understanding that  no compromise is perfect. Frontline workers, including public health  workers, firefighters, and other essential workers employed by state  and local governments continue to need our support.  The bill before us today provides a lifeline to those who are  struggling from the COVID-19 pandemic and the recession it has caused.  It extends critical programs first authorized by the CARES Act  including $300 per week in additional unemployment benefits, a second  round of direct payments of up to $600, $284 billion for additional  small business loans under the Paycheck Protection Program, and $13  billion in nutrition assistance for Americans facing hunger. It also  provides $25 billion to help renters pay their rent and stay in their  homes. I'm deeply disappointed that the Administration and the Senate  Majority Leader would not allow restaurants and their workers to  receive our help. With over 300 bipartisan cosponsors on the RESTAURANT  Act, these businesses and their workers should have been in this  legislation.  In addition to pandemic relief, the bill funds the government through  the remainder of the fiscal year, avoiding a costly government shutdown  before the holidays, and invests in critical priorities, including  clean energy, affordable housing, public schools, and broadband. I'm  proud to have secured $100 million for the electrification of Caltrain,  $8.9 million for environmental conservation of the San Francisco Bay,  $33 million for construction of the Linac Coherent Light Source upgrade  (LCLS-II) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, and $85.2 million  for the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) at  NASA Ames.  Our country is in the midst of the worst public health crisis in a  century, and I'm proud to say that the Democrats on the Energy and  Commerce Health Subcommittee, which I have had the privilege to lead,  have stepped up to the challenge by securing provisions that include  the following:  Provide billions to ensure the free, timely, and equitable  distribution of safe, effective vaccines and more resources for a  national testing strategy:  End surprise medical billing. No patient will face an unexpected,  expensive bill just because they are caught in a web of providers.  Assist doctors and public and rural hospitals survive the pandemic by  stopping planned Medicare and Medicaid cuts.  Provide three years of funding for critical public health programs  including Community Health Centers, Teaching Health Centers, the  National Health Service Corps, and the special diabetes programs.  Restore Medicaid coverage for the citizens of the freely associated  states living in the U.S., to whom America has for too long abandoned  its commitments to.  Improve Medicare coverage for beneficiaries across the country by  simplifying Part B enrollment; permanently authorizing the use of  telehealth for mental health care; eliminating cost-sharing for  colorectal cancer screenings; and extending coverage for  immunosuppressive drugs for kidney transplant patients. I'm especially  proud to have co-led and championed the immunosuppressive drug coverage  legislation to correct a short-sighted coverage policy [["", Page , H7310, ] which will save 375 kidney transplants each year. This provision  appears in Section 402 of Division CC and is based on ', H.R. 5534, "", the  Comprehensive Immunosuppressive Drug Coverage for Kidney Transplant  Patients Act of 2019.  Improve the Medicaid program by expanding access to certified  community behavioral health clinics; eliminate spousal impoverishment  for partners of Medicaid beneficiaries receiving home and community- based services; and continuing the Money Follows the Person rebalancing  demonstration which makes it possible for people on Medicaid to  transition to a safer home or community-based environment and still  maintain Medicaid funding.  Lower health care costs by strengthening parity in mental health and  substance use disorder benefits; removing gag clauses on health price  and quality information; ending a loophole that allowed drugs for  opioid use disorder to benefit from the orphan drug designation; and  making it easier for biosimilar products to come to market by  increasing patent and exclusivity transparency. This final provision  appears in Section 325 of Division BB, and it is a bill I'm proud to  have sponsored, "", H.R. 1520, "", the Purple Book Continuity Act. It requires  patent information for biologics to be submitted to the FDA and  published in the publicly-available ``Purple Book.'' By creating a  single, searchable list of licensed biologics, manufacturers will be  able to plan a pipeline of lower-cost biosimilar products for years to  come.  I'm also proud to have several health appropriations which I  requested included in today's agreement. These items represent the  critical advancement of life-saving research and care, including: $15  million for the Pancreatic Cancer Research Program at the DOD, which  I've long championed and which comes as the world continues to mourn  the deaths this year of several iconic Americans from this very  aggressive cancer, including Congressman John Lewis and Supreme Court  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg; $42.9 billion for the NIH for forward  thinking investments in medical research; $597 million for critical  biodefense and public health emergency preparedness at BARDA, which my  legislation created. Another $19.7 billion is in the COVID-19 relief  agreement for BARDA to manufacture and procure vaccines; $350 million  for the Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education Program to  support pediatric medical residents' training; and $5.4 million for  research on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome at the CDC to better understand  this terrible disease.  There's still so much more the American people need. We must increase  federal funding for the Medicaid program during this health and  economic crisis, including home-and-community-based services, improve  infection control and quality in our nation's nursing homes, and  address the public health crises that continue during the COVID-19  pandemic, such as America's unacceptable rates of maternal mortality,  suicides, and overdoses. I'm proud of what we've accomplished in the  Health Subcommittee this year and energized to continue the fight in  2021.  Today's agreement includes important clean energy provisions,  including my legislation, "", H.R. 1420, "", the Energy Efficient Government  Technology Act, which appears as Sections 1003 and 1004 of Division Z.  The bill requires government agencies to develop plans to implement  best practices for energy management, purchase more energy efficient  information and communications technologies, and submit to periodic  evaluation of their data centers for energy efficiency.  Data centers are a critical part of our national infrastructure and  are found in nearly every sector of our economy. The federal government  alone has more than 2,000 data centers which store everything from  Social Security and tax records, toe-books at the Library of Congress.  Despite their importance to our government and our economy, many are  extremely inefficient when it comes to energy use.  The good news is many data centers can significantly reduce their  energy use using existing technology and best practices. This will  reduce not only the government's carbon footprint but also its energy  bills. My bipartisan legislation has the potential to save taxpayers  hundreds of millions of dollars in reduced energy costs in the future,  while setting an example for the private sector to reduce energy usage  at data centers.  We must ensure students in need can continue their studies during the  pandemic as colleges begin another semester of remote learning, and I'm  proud that our agreement includes funding for these students. Section  902 of Division N is modeled on "", H.R. 6814, "", the Supporting Connectivity  for Higher Education Students in Need Act, bicameral legislation I  introduced on May 13, 2020.  The provision provides $285 million to expand connectivity for  historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal colleges and  universities, Hispanic-serving institutions and other minority-serving  institutions, their students, and minority-owned businesses near those  colleges. The funding can be used to purchase routers, modems, wi-fi  hotspots, tablets, and laptops. Funding recipients must prioritize low- income students. The legislation also establishes the Office of  Minority Broadband Initiatives within the NTIA to carry out programs  expand access to broadband at and in communities around HBCUs, TCUs,  HSis and other MSis.  Between 2012 and 2018, over $1.2 billion in 9-1-1 fees were diverted  to uses other than 9-1-1. While most states curtailed this horrific  practice, four states continue diverting 9-1-1 fees: New Jersey, New  York, Rhode Island, and Nevada. I first co-led the bipartisan 9-1-1 Fee  Integrity Act to require by statute that 9-1-1 fees can only be used  for 9-1-1 purposes on September 14, 2018. I'm pleased that the  legislation appears in Section 902 of Division FF.  I'm pleased that today's agreement includes funding for AI R&D. The  Joint Explanatory Statement for Division B includes direction for AI  R&D to expand at NSF and NIST, including with a focus on increasing AI  workforce diversity and developing a framework for ethical and safe AI.  I've twice written to the House Appropriations Subcommittee on  Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies requesting robust AI  R&D funding, and I thank them for their leadership in taking an  important step to increase AI funding.  I'm pleased that this legislation includes funding for several  technology and telecommunications matters that are priorities for me  and for our country, including $3.2 billion for a $50 per month  emergency broadband benefit for low income families, Pell Grant  recipients, students eligible for free or reduced lunch, and recently  unemployed individuals; $1.9 billion to `rip and replace'  telecommunications equipment made by insecure supplies, like Huawei and  ZTE, which I first asked the FCC to investigate in 2010; $250 million  for the FCC's COVID-19 Telehealth Program; and $65 million to develop  reliable broadband maps which are critical for the federal government  and all states to know where broadband support funding would be most  effective.
