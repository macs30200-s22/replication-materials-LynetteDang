John Rose,0.0298204068094491,R," Mr. ROSE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, on July 20, 1940, Judge Luke  Medley started a small radio station in Cookeville, Tennessee, my  hometown. And for the last 80 years, WHUB Newstalk 101.7 and 1400, the  Hub, has stood the test of time and been a haven for community events  and local news.  WHUB's motto is: ``Where community always comes first.'' They have  always implemented that motto for the citizens of the Upper Cumberland  in Tennessee, and they always will. WHUB has been the winner of  numerous awards in the last 80 years from the State of Tennessee and  the National Association of Broadcasters.  Congratulations to owner Jerry Zimmer, program director Brent Carl  Fleshman, news director Shawn Jacobs, and general manager John Monk for  their constant hard work to keep WHUB the number one news talk radio  station in the Upper Cumberland.  Happy 80th anniversary to WHUB. God bless Tennessee, and God bless  America.    "
