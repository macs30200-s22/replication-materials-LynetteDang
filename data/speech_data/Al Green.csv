Al Green,1.3915598392486572,D," Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  decades-long service of a public servant who embodies what makes  Tennessee the Volunteer State, Mr. Johnny Blakely.  After 18 years faithfully representing the Congressman for  Tennessee's Seventh District, Johnny will begin his next chapter of  life in the new year.  For 24 years, he served on the school board, including 17 years as  chairman. Johnny also served as vice mayor of his hometown.  He and Linda, his charming wife of 56 years, have three children-- Ross, Lora, and Jeremy--and seven grandchildren.  On behalf of the United States Congress, I am proud to congratulate  Johnny Blakely on his retirement and express our gratitude for his 18  years of service to Tennessee's Seventh District.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the decades-long service of a  public servant who embodies what makes Tennessee the Volunteer State,  Mr. Johnny Blakely.  After 18 years faithfully representing the member of Congress for  Tennessee's Seventh District, Johnny will begin his next chapter of  life in the new year.  Johnny grew up in McNairy County in west Tennessee, where his mother  diligently raised a family of five while also working in the local shoe  factory. After a thirty-five year career at [["", Page , H7026, ] AT&T, he joined then-Congressman Marsha Blackburn's office. When I was  elected to Congress, he agreed to postpone retirement to continue  serving our district for two more years.  Johnny has been the invaluable link between the work we do in  congress and the local communities in the district by being a resource  for constituents and community leaders and listening to the concerns  and challenges facing rural Tennesseans.  Johnny understands the challenges of our community leaders because he  himself has been one throughout his life. For 24 years, he served on  the McNairy County Board of Education, including 17 years as chairman.  During this time, the Board of Education oversaw two multi-million- dollar building projects in the county. In 1992, he was selected to  serve on the All Tennessee School Board. Johnny also served as Vice  Mayor of his beloved hometown, Ramer.  Johnny and Linda, his ceaselessly charming wife of 56 years, have  three children--Ross, Lora, and Jeremy--and seven grandchildren. Johnny  has always sought to put his family first and he is proud of everything  that his children and grandchildren have accomplished. He and his  family are longtime members of Ramer Baptist Church, where he has  served many years as an Ordained Deacon, Music Director, and Sunday  School Teacher.  Johnny has done an outstanding job serving the people of Tennessee  and this nation through his volunteer work and his professional career  of public service, and it has been an honor and a privilege to have him  as a member of my staff.  On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I'm proud to  congratulate Johnny Blakely on his retirement and to express our  gratitude for his lifelong commitment to his community and his 18 years  of faithful and diligent service to the people of Tennessee's Seventh  Congressional District.
