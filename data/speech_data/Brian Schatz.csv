Brian Schatz,0.8039230108261108,D," Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.  Let's get clear about what is happening here. The first thing is we  did something momentous as a group. We, on a bipartisan basis, decided  to provide paid parental leave of 12 weeks for the Federal workforce-- 2.1 million Federal workers--so that individuals who are new parents  don't have to make that impossible choice between receiving a paycheck  and being a new dad or a new mom. Now, this is catching us up with the  rest of the world. The rest of the industrialized world understands  that this isn't just a humane thing to do for families. This is the  right way to manage the workforce because you get higher productivity;  you get better morale; and you get lower turnover. This is a smart  thing to do.  There were 2.1 million people covered by this momentous change of  Federal policy agreed upon over the last 48 hours on a bipartisan  basis. There was a technical problem, and so the following Federal  employees are not going to be covered unless we make this technical  fix: employees of the DC courts, public defenders, Presidential  appointees, FAA, and CSA employees, and article I judges. Everybody  else is going to get 12 weeks of paid parental leave, except for these  people. We can solve that today.  That is what my unanimous consent request is all about. What the  Senator from Pennsylvania has decided to do is take a hostage and say,  These are the only Federal employees who are not going to get this  benefit because of a technical and drafting error because I didn't get  something totally unrelated that has to do with a tax bill that was  passed on purely partisan lines in a hurry, written primarily by  lobbyists in the middle of the night.  Now, I do not mind entertaining a change to the Tax Code to deal with  this question of how you expense the renovation of restaurants and  retail operations, but I think Senator Wyden is exactly right. I guess  the Senator from Pennsylvania thought this was a talking point on the  Republican side. Heaven forbid if there should be a negotiation. Heaven  forbid something that is as important to the Republicans that is as a  result of their screw-up and would cost tens of billions of dollars  would not be given away for free.  The argument being made is, hey, technical for technical. This is an  actual technical fix. This is a bill we just enacted in the last 48  hours. I am not even sure if the President has signed it yet, but it is  about to be enacted into law, and nobody is arguing that we should not  cover some small portion of the Federal workforce.  Nobody is arguing that was the legislative intent. Nobody is arguing  that is public policy. What the Senator from Pennsylvania is saying, If  I don't get my thing, then these people don't get the help that they  deserve. These people, by happenstance of a drafting error, don't get  paid parental leave. Now, this has human consequences.  I object to the Senator's modification of my unanimous consent  request, and I am deeply disappointed that we can't fix this simple  thing. I am happy to work with the Senator from Pennsylvania on a quick  fix. I think we will get there at some point next year, but this has to  be part of a broader bipartisan deal, and he knows that.  This is going to cost tens of billions of dollars, and no one gives  tens of billions of dollars for nothing. Everything of that magnitude  has to be negotiated on a bipartisan, bicameral basis. That is not what  he is trying to do. He is trying to say because we made a technical  error that was monumentally wrong and, as a result of the flawed  process, why don't we trade technical fixes. This is a relatively small  technical fix, and he wants to trade it for a massive technical fix  that is now 2 years old.  The only thing I would say is this may be small in the context of how  we operate in the U.S. Senate. It is not small if you work for the FAA  and you are a new dad. It is not small if you are an article I judge  and you are a new mom. It is not small for these people who deserve  paid parental leave like every other Federal employee will get soon.    "
