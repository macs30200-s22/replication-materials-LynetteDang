Sean Casten,0.8515360951423645,D," Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Madam Speaker, imagine that you are a banker  reviewing a corporate loan application. Over the last decade,  competition has eroded this company's market share. They slashed prices  in response; they burned through their cash. 250 similar companies have  gone bankrupt since 2014.  Would you make that loan?  This is today's U.S. fossil fuel industry. Since 2010, coal demand is  down 45 percent. Natural gas prices are down 40 percent. Oil prices are  down 45 percent. Shale producers have chewed through $342 billion of  free cash flow. Exxon just wrote off $20 billion in value. Wells Fargo  booked $121 million in sector losses.  And yet, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has recently  proposed a rule to mandate that banks provide ``fair access to  capital'' to this sector. They would force you to use your balance  sheet to take on excessive risk without commensurate return. They would  reduce our financial stability and raise our energy costs.  I look forward to a full-throated and bipartisan condemnation of the  OCC's attempt to use, dare I say, socialist tools to prop up an  industry that is unable to succeed in the rough-and-tumble world of  free-market capitalism.
