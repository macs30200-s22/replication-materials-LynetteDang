{"Mr. GRASSLEY": " Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. That is why we are allowing these businesses, both  those with forgiven loans and those without, to claim credits for wages  paid in previous quarters that this bill makes eligible for the credit  on their fourth quarter 2020 payroll tax filings. This will prevent  small businesses from having to amend their previously filed payroll  tax returns, easing the paperwork burden for both taxpayers and the  Internal Revenue Service. I know Ranking Member Wyden will join me in  urging the IRS to do all they can to simplify and expedite the process  for eligible businesses retroactively claiming the retention credit.  The last thing these businesses need right now is additional, complex  payroll tax filings.  I thank the ranking member for engaging in this colloquy to discuss  this important issue and the clarification included in the pending  appropriations bill.    ", "Mr. SCHUMER": " Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, the Senate today meets for a rare New  Year's Eve session for one reason and one reason only: The Republican  leader has refused to allow us to vote on legislation to provide the  American people $2,000 checks. He has twice objected to my requests to  set a time for a vote on the measure, claiming yesterday that direct  stimulus checks were ``poorly targeted,'' bemoaning the idea that some  of these checks might go into ``the hands of Democrats' rich friends  who don't need the help.'' Senator Toomey said much the same thing.  Well, funny, I don't remember the Republican leader and Senator  Toomey complaining about how a $2 trillion across-the-board corporate  tax cut was ``poorly targeted'' because some large companies didn't  need the help. No, when corporations get a blanket tax break, that is  fine by the Republican majority. When the average American gets a  little help from their government, it is ``poorly targeted.''  I hope that every American heard the objections by these Republican  Senators. I hope every American who has their water or heat or  electricity shut off or had eviction notices stapled on top of one  another to their door or had to choose which meal to skip on a given  day--I hope they all heard the reason they will not receive $2,000  checks is because Leader McConnell thinks it could wind up in the hands  of ``Democrats' rich friends.''  Let's be very clear. There is one way and only one way to pass $2,000  checks before the end of the year, and that is to pass the House bill.  It is the only way to get the American people the $2,000 checks they  need and deserve.  The House is gone for the session. Any modification or addition to  the House bill can't become law. Either the Senate takes up and passes  the House bill or struggling Americans will not get $2,000 checks  during the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.  Leader McConnell knows this. So he has said that the Senate can only  vote on a bill that combines the checks with other unrelated partisan  policies: a repeal of section 230 and an investigation into the  President's dishonest and bogus claims of election fraud.  The Republican leader claims that President Trump insists that all  three issues must be addressed in one bill, but, of course, the  President has made no such demand. President Trump couldn't care less  about how the bills are packaged in Congress.  So the Republican leader has invented an excuse to prevent a clean,  up-or-down, yes-or-no vote on $2,000 checks from coming to the floor.  This maneuver to combine all three issues is intended to kill the  possibility of $2,000 checks ever becoming law.  Just to prove it, let me make this offer to the Republican majority.  We are willing to vote on the other issues that President Trump  mentioned--all the issues the Republican leader says must be  addressed--so long as we vote on them separately. That way, $2,000  checks could become law, and we could debate all the President's  supposed concerns.  We can vote on setting up a commission to look at the President's  roundly rejected claims of voter fraud. We would also have the  commission look at voter suppression and gerrymandering. That is  completely unrelated to helping Americans pay their bills, but we are  willing to take a look at the whole picture. Just give us a vote on the  House-passed bill so we can get help now for people who desperately  need it.  Heck, we can also have a vote on repealing 230. We can do it today.  We will use Leader McConnell's exact language. He wouldn't agree to  that because he knows his caucus wouldn't actually support such an act.  Unlike the President, some Members of this body understand what 230  means. They understand that section 230, which certainly needs change,  actually enables the President to spew his lies.  We all know the 117th Congress will have to take a close look at the  relationship between liability and reckless speech on the internet. But  if Leader McConnell wants a vote on these issues, we are here for it.  Just give us a vote on the House-passed bill, and we can vote on  whatever rightwing conspiracy theory you would like.  We can even vote to set up a special blue-ribbon commission to  determine whether Georgia's secretary of State has a brother named Ron,  if that would make our Republican friends happy.  Just don't let these conspiracy theories and Presidential fantasies  get in the way of helping actual people--people whose livelihoods have  been torn apart by this pandemic, people whose lives have been torn  apart by the administration's mismanagement of this pandemic, people  who need just a little direct assistance.  The President's term, thankfully, will end in 20 days. It is a term  that has been marked by hate and division and turmoil. He has so far  used his term to enrich himself and the wealthy.  Let's close out the term on a good note. For once, he wants to help  regular people, to give Americans a leg up. Let's allow him to do that.  We have a chance at the end of this painful year to give Americans a  reason to have some hope in 2021. The only [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7987\">Page S7987</a>, ] thing standing in the way is the Republican Senate majority. In a  moment, I will, once again, ask consent that the Senate set a time for  a vote on the House bill to provide $2,000 checks to the American  people. Remember, the Democrats are willing to vote on all of the other  issues that the Republicans say the President supposedly cares about.  Just let us vote on a clean bill with the $2,000 checks.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 645, ', H.R. 9051, ', a bill to  increase the recovery rebate amounts to $2,000 for individuals; that  the bill be read a third time and the Senate vote on passage; and that  if passed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?    ", "Mr. CORNYN": " Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor and talk  about what strikes me as something akin to Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day  is only the day I was born. It is something I feel like we are living  through here as we debate the same points over [[', <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7978\">Page S7978</a>, ] and over and over again, forgetting what it is we have already done-- the good things we have done together on a bipartisan basis.  We have already appropriated roughly $4 trillion in response to this  pandemic, and it is appropriate that we have done so because this was a  true public health crisis. But now this is--we are seeing politics  creep back in in an attempt to send money in an untargeted and wasteful  sort of way to people who have suffered no financial loss.  These relief packages that we passed together have provided hundreds  of billions of dollars to support our hospitals and healthcare workers  who are on the frontlines. I voted for it, and I think we were right to  do so.  We have thrown small businesses and their employees a lifeline  through the Paycheck Protection Program, and we were right to do so. We  have invested in research, development, and manufacturing of  therapeutics and vaccines that are currently being administered--thank  goodness--throughout the country and, indeed, around the world. And we  have sent unprecedented assistance to workers, families, and  individuals whose livelihoods have been upended by this crisis.  Thanks to President Trump's leadership, Congress has stepped up and  met this unprecedented challenge to deliver relief bill after relief  bill for the American people. If you had told me a year ago I would  have voted this year alone for roughly $4 trillion worth of spending in  this pandemic, I would not have believed you. But I do believe this is  a domestic equivalent to World War II, where we have to do everything  humanly possible to try to help our fellow man, woman, and child during  this pandemic.  The latest round of relief came, of course, just this week, when  President Trump signed the $900 billion rescue package into law. While  I am glad Congress was able to send more relief out the door at the end  of the year, I am disappointed that it took so long to do so. It is  amazing the sense of urgency our Democratic colleagues have today,  since at least three times--maybe four times--they blocked our attempts  to pass half-trillion-dollar relief bills during the course of the  summer.  In July, our colleagues introduced the HEALS Act, which would have  provided just under a trillion dollars in relief, covering the same  types of policies included in the most recent relief bill--direct  payments, unemployment benefits, funding for schools, vaccines, and a  host of other priorities.  Our Democratic colleagues not only complained about the bill, but  they called it weak, little, pathetic, and unserious. They refused to  engage in the sorts of negotiations that are customary around here when  you actually want to solve a problem or consider anything short of the  House's multitrillion-dollar bill, which they knew had no chance of  passing in the Senate because of things like tax cuts for millionaires  and billionaires, which had nothing to do with COVID.  So our Democratic colleagues dragged their feet--July, August,  September, October, November. Months went by, and the cases soared, and  the economic squeeze tightened, and our Democratic colleagues refused  to accept any sort of compromise.  That was until a few weeks ago, when they finally changed their tune  right after the election. I am sure it comes as no surprise that once  the holdout agrees to negotiate, things can move pretty quickly, and  that is what happened here after the election. Democrats, Republicans,  and the administration agreed to a $900 billion package, which looks  very similar to the one they dubbed pathetic just a few months ago.  In recent days, the President has expressed an interest in doing  more, and I have no doubt that we will do more in this area, but  Speaker Pelosi's bill goes far beyond what the President is talking  about. For one, it would dramatically widen the pool of recipients,  enabling wealthy households to qualify for relief checks. This is  unacceptable and wasteful.  When Congress provided the first round of direct payments through the  CARES Act, we did so in a way that sent relief to the hardest hit  Americans. Individuals who made up to $75,000 received the full $1,200,  and the amount gradually declined as income increased and completely  phased out at $99,000. We kept the same formula for the $600 payments  provided for under the omnibus and further targeted the relief. Once  again, those who made up to $75,000 will receive the full amount, and  the amount phases out completely at $87,000.  Under the CARES Act, a family of four earning up to $150,000 received  $3,400, and in the most recent rescue bill, the same family would  receive an additional $2,400. This was the most effective and targeted  way to ensure that assistance goes to those who actually need it while  avoiding sending taxpayer dollars--borrowed, I might add--to those who  don't.  The House-passed legislation would provide $2,000 payments, but it  doesn't have a similar structure to keep these payments targeted. Let  me give you an example.  If this bill were to become law, a person making $100,000 a year  would receive a $750 check from the Federal Government, whether or not  they lost income during the pandemic. This isn't someone who used to  make that much but was laid off or had a reduction in their income.  Someone who is currently earning a six-figure salary would receive an  additional $750 from American taxpayers.  For families, the income barrier goes higher. As I mentioned a moment  ago, if you have a family of five with an annual household income of  $350,000 a year, that family would receive a stimulus check under the  House-passed bill. Now, that is not being smart with taxpayer dollars,  and that is not targeted at the people who actually need it. That is a  giveaway to people who have not suffered any financial losses during  this pandemic and clearly not targeted at those who need the most help.  I mentioned a moment ago that the median income for households in  Texas is $60,000 a year, so this family of five is earning nearly six  times as much and would still receive a check from taxpayers. That  defies all common sense. Even the Washington Post editorial board  dubbed this policy as wasteful because of the huge amounts destined for  what they call ``perfectly comfortable families.''  Even though Congress has already provided roughly $4 trillion in  relief to the American people, our Democratic colleagues are acting as  though this is the first and only way to help our country.  Like I said, for them, every day is Groundhog Day. They ignore  everything we have done in the past and act like this is the only thing  we have or could do. It is just not true  This debate isn't about whether or not Congress should help families  who are struggling. We have. And there is no question we will continue  to do so where needed. That is why we provided $1,200 in direct  payments to the hardest hit Americans through the CARES Act and an  additional $600 through the most recent relief bill. That is why these  bills also bolstered State unemployment benefits and expanded them to  include independent contractors and the self-employed. That is why  Congress passed legislation to provide food assistance to families,  keep more hard-working Americans on payroll, and ensure our economy is  on track for a strong recovery.  Again, we did this thanks to the leadership of President Trump and by  working together in a bipartisan way.  Countless Texans have told me about the impact of this relief on  their businesses and their families, and we can't lose sight of the  progress that has already been made. But future relief must be  targeted. We need to support those who need it and avoid sending  hundreds of billions of dollars, as this proposal would, to those who  don't need it.  Throughout the year, I have been an advocate for an incremental  approach to these relief bills because I think it is hard to spend $3  trillion and know exactly how that bill is going to work. And, indeed,  we found out through the CARES Act that the mainstream lending  facility, which we funded at roughly half a trillion dollars, wasn't as  useful as we would have hoped.  Conversely, the Paycheck Protection Program was more successful than  our wildest dreams. So I think by seeing what works and what doesn't  work, we can be better stewards of taxpayer dollars by spending the  money more efficiently and in a more targeted way. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7979\">Page S7979</a>, ]  This isn't like highway bills or farm bills or defense spending bills  where we have an idea about what is needed for individual programs.  There was no precedent for this pandemic, no handbook, and no clear way  to gauge how long this crisis would go on or what would be needed to  sustain our response.  After the CARES Act passed, we knew it made the most sense to hit the  pause button and see what worked well, what didn't, and where more help  was needed. As I said, there were certain programs like the Paycheck  Protection Program that almost immediately dried up. If I am not  mistaken, in 2 weeks, roughly $350 billion was obligated under the  Paycheck Protection Program--a strong indication that we really hit the  sweet spot when it came to helping those small businesses. That is why  we added more funding in April, another $320 billion, and we extended  the program in July and reinvested in the Paycheck Protection Program  again in the omnibus.  As I said, there were other places where the money went unspent. But,  fortunately, in the most recent bill we were able to repurpose hundreds  of billions of dollars in unspent funds, again, to target it to where  the need was greatest and where it could help the most.  There is no question that tens of millions of workers and their  families have been hurt by this virus. We all know that. And I think we  have all acted together, by and large, responsibly, in trying to  respond to that. No one will be left out if we have a means and method  of targeting this to those people--whether it is direct payments,  enhanced unemployment benefits, incentives to their employers to  maintain them on payroll. And now that we have the beginning of the  distribution of the vaccine, my hope is that in the coming months we  will get back to, if not the new normal, whatever the next normal will  be.  But we are just a few days from kicking off the new Congress, and I  have no reason to believe that our coronavirus relief work is finished  here today. As a matter of fact, Vice President Biden said that he  expects to send us an additional request for help once he assumes  office.  Once the legislation we have passed has a chance to benefit the  American people, we will see if more relief is needed, and then, if it  is needed, we should absolutely do more.  I still believe in the wisdom of the incremental approach, and I  believe our Democratic friends will join us in responding to the true  needs of this crisis without monthlong delays or irresponsible  spending.  Countless Texans have told me about the importance of the relief we  have provided through direct payments, unemployment benefits, food  assistance, and other forms of support by the laws we passed throughout  this year. I was proud to support each of those policies, which have  eased the financial strains on millions of Texans and other Americans.  I will continue to work with our colleagues to provide assistance as  our war on COVID-19 rages on.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. HAWLEY": " Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the COVID relief  bill that I understand is soon to be brought before the House and then  to this floor.  I understand that we have finally, at long last, a deal that  hopefully will result in real relief for the American people. And there  is a piece of good news that I want to be sure to note, and that is  that this COVID relief package will contain direct assistance to  working people. For every working family in this country that needs it,  they will be, under this deal, getting a direct check just like they  did in March.  Now, that is a victory. There are no two ways about it, and we should  celebrate that victory not on our own behalf but for the many people in  this Nation who desperately need it and who, until just a few days ago,  could expect nothing at all in the way of direct assistance from this  body.  I want to thank those who worked so hard to make sure that this  relief was available and is going to the working people of this  country--not least the President of the United States, who has been  very clear, over and over again, that he wants to see direct relief to  working families, that it should be the cornerstone of the bill. Of  course, I thank Senator Sanders for his strong stand on this issue, and  it has been a privilege to work with him on it.  So this is good news--good news for working families, good news for  working people just before Christmas, when they need the help the most.  But I have to say that the levels of support that I understand will  be offered to working people are hardly adequate, and we should not  pretend otherwise: $600 per person, $600 per child. This is a fraction  of what was offered to working people in the CARES legislation just a  few months ago--legislation, I might add, that every Member of this  body voted for--every Member voted for. Now they will be getting only a  portion of that. It all adds up to about $100 billion. And we are told  that there just wasn't enough left over, that there just wasn't any  more available for working people.  Yet I notice that in the spending bill that we are also going to vote  on as part of this package, a bill that costs over $1 trillion, we  managed to have found $65 million for salmon recovery in the Pacific,  $643 million to carry out international communication activities in the  Middle East, $116 million for the Export-Import Bank, and $118 million  for that sterling example of international leadership, the World Health  Organization, which has done more to undermine world health in the last  year than I think any international organization in the history of the  world.  Then there is the so-called bipartisan proposal, which is the basis  for the present deal--the bipartisan proposal which included, I might  point out, not a cent--not a cent--in direct relief for working  people--almost $1 trillion in costs, not one penny in direct relief for  working people, until it was added recently. That proposal included $20  billion for higher education--$20 billion. This is going to many  universities that have massive endowments worth billions and billions  of dollars, most of that built on the backs of taxpayers, I might add.  Yet we cannot find any further funds to help working people in this  country.  I cannot help but note that working people were the last  consideration in the draconian shutdowns earlier this year that sent so  many of them home, that cost them their jobs, that cost them their  wages, that cost them their healthcare on the job, and they have  consistently been the last consideration in COVID relief in this body  ever since. Frankly, it is disgraceful and, frankly, it is  unacceptable.  So the work that we are going to do today--and I hope to see a vote  on this floor yet today on this relief--is a step--a step--in the right  direction, but it is only a step. And I hope that it will be the  beginning of a better approach, the beginning of actually putting  working Americans first, putting their needs, putting their  independence, putting their strength, their families, their communities  first.  That ought to be the economic policy of this Nation. That ought to be  the economic policy of this body. And I can assure you, that is the  foundation on which economic recovery will be built because it is the  working people of this Nation who power the American economy.  Don't believe anything else. We hear a lot about global capital. We  hear about the need to secure the financial markets--oh, and, by the  way, the Federal Reserve. We are taking back $430 billion from the  Federal Reserve in this piece of legislation--$430 billion from the  Federal Reserve--funded to the max. Wall Street--funded to the max.  But I say again: Wall Street, capital, the financial markets--they  are not the foundation of this economy. The working people of this  Nation, the working people of Missouri, the working people of our other  States--they are the foundation of this economy, and it is time that  they were put first--first for COVID relief, first in our economic  policy, first in all that we do.  So I hope that this effort to get them direct assistance will be the  beginning of a larger effort to orient our economic policy and the  policy of this Nation around the strength and the independence and the  needs of our great working Americans.  I want to end by saying thank you to them, thank you to the working  people of Missouri who have endured through this crisis day in and day  out, who have gone to work as essential workers, who have taken care of  children at home, who have missed shifts at work in order to care for  loved ones, who have contributed food to others in need even when they  didn't have enough food for themselves, who have gone without in order  to see that their children could eat.  The people of this country, the working people who have sacrificed  again and again and again and have borne the brunt of this pandemic and  have continued to show up for their families, for [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7859\">Page S7859</a>, ] their communities, and for this country--thank you. Thank you for  making this country work. Thank you for building this country as we  know it.  Help is on the way. Help is on the way in this bill, which I hope  will become law tonight. But there is much more to do, and I, for one,  stand ready to work to do it.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. KAINE": " Mr. KAINE. Madam President, on November 9, 2016, I had one of the  most memorable experiences of my life.  I stood on a hotel stage in New York City and, as my party's nominee  for Vice President, introduced Secretary Hillary Clinton to address her  supporters and the Nation for a concession speech. The polls in the  Western United States had just been closed for about 10 hours, and it  was a mere 8 hours after news organizations had called the 2016  election for Donald Trump.  Hillary Clinton had made history. She was the first woman nominee of  a major party for President, and she had won the popular vote by  millions of votes.  She was also deeply concerned about the election itself. Candidate  Donald Trump had openly solicited help from a foreign adversary to win  the election. While the dimensions of the foreign misinformation  campaign were not yet fully clear, the Nation's intelligence community  had publicly warned that a foreign country was active in efforts to  undermine Secretary Clinton's candidacy and create chaos and division  in the American electorate.  But Hillary Clinton was and is a patriotic American. She knew that  she was behind by nearly 77,000 votes in the key States of  Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. She knew that it was highly  unlikely that recounts would change any of those three deficits in any  appreciable way.  I watched Secretary Clinton struggle with the war between her  personal feelings and her earnest search for what was right for the  country, and I struggled with those same feelings. I was proud of  Secretary Clinton when she walked to a microphone and said these words:  Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to   work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will   be a successful president for all Americans. This is not the   outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for and I'm sorry that   we did not win the election for the values we share and the   vision we hold for our country.  We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we   thought. But I still believe in America and I always will.   And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look   to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our next   president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.  Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful   transfer of power and we don't just respect that, we cherish   it.  It takes a strong moral compass to quickly set aside personal  disappointment and choose country over your own personal feelings.  Hillary Clinton demonstrated leadership that day.  I take the floor today to ask why Donald Trump won't put the country  over his personal feelings, but I particularly want to ask my  Republican Senate colleagues: Why won't you ask the President of your  party to do the right thing and put the interests of the country over  personal or partisan pursuits?  It is now 9 days after election day. It is 5 days since all major  news organizations called the Presidential election for Joe Biden and  Kamala Harris. Donald Trump is now behind in the popular vote by more  than 5 million votes, and that number is rising. Some suggest that the  ultimate margin will be closer to 7 million votes. Donald Trump is  behind in the key States of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin--not  by the 77,000-vote margin of 4 years ago but by nearly 220,000 votes,  and that number is going up every day. Donald Trump has lost two other  key States that he won in 2016--Georgia and Arizona. Yet how is  President Trump acting? Like a spoiled child.  But it is not just a childish refusal to concede a loss; in his  weakness, he is willing to speak and act in ways destructive to our  democracy. He has not reached out to President-Elect Biden. He has not  conceded. He and his White House team are instructing Federal agencies  not to cooperate with the Biden transition. He is not allowing  congressionally appropriated moneys to be used by the Biden transition.  He is spreading unfounded rumors about voter fraud or irregularities  without meaningful evidence. He is trashing hard-working election  officials--even Republican officials--with his baseless claims. As  reported yesterday by Military.com, his legal team is even branding as  fraudulent ballots sent in by American service men and women and their  families.  Just as ominous, President Trump is starting a purge of officials at  the Pentagon, beginning with the firing of Defense Secretary Mark  Esper. The officials the President is now jamming into short-term  acting roles at the Pentagon include some who are unqualified and some  who even Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee have  previously determined are unfit to serve. These actions send a message  of chaos and instability to adversaries around the world at the very  time when the United States should be trying to send a message of calm  and order.  It is futile to ask President Trump to put country over his personal  interests. He has not been willing to do that. But I do ask my Senate  Republican colleagues: Won't you concede that the country has elected a  new President? Won't you speak out against baseless claims of voter  fraud that whip up dangerous division at home, demean hard-working  election officials, and paint an embarrassing picture of the United  States around the world? Won't you demand that the Trump administration  allow the Biden transition team the resources that we in Congress have  provided to assist in that important task? [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6669\">Page S6669</a>, ] Won't you ask the President to avoid massive firings or other personnel  actions in the lameduck period that heighten the sense of American  instability? Won't you stand up for the proposition that peaceful  transfers of power are a sacred part of our American heritage?  I recently took a look at comments that I made on the floor at this  very spot on February 4. I was worried then, but my comments read even  more frightening now. I stood here to explain my vote for  impeachment. I said then:  ``Unchallenged evil spreads like a virus. We have allowed a   toxic President to infect the Senate and warp its behavior.   An acquittal will lead to worse behavior.''  The acquittal of this President has led to worse behavior. He is  willing to demean our democracy in the eyes of the world because he is  too weak to acknowledge that he lost an election. But there is still  time for the Senate to be the adult leaders that this Nation so badly  needs. Patriotic and mature leadership will not come from the President  or the administration. The Senate must provide it.  And in the Senate, at this moment, strong Republican leadership to  condemn President Trump's foolishness is key. When we Democrats stand  up against the President, it makes little difference. We just get  discounted by the President and his supporters. They are quickly  forming a dangerous ``Lost Cause'' mythology about a stolen election.  Every single Member of this Chamber knows that the myth that is being  perpetrated is a lie. But some people will fall for the myth unless  Republicans are willing to stand up and call out the lie.  The next 10 weeks are filled with peril. With COVID cases rising,  hospitalizations increasing, deaths tragically multiplying, and people  and businesses still suffering, we should be laser-focused on crushing  this virus and rebuilding the American economy. The United States does  not have the luxury to engage in conspiracy theories and multiple bogus  election challenges.  To my colleagues, especially my Republican colleagues, the Nation  needs the Senate right now to send a message of calm transition to a  new administration. Please put our country first.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    ", "Mr. DURBIN": " Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would like to for a moment just  reflect on where we are at this session of the U.S. Senate and the  choices that have been made.  I want to thank Senator Sanders and Senator Schumer for bringing  this, with clarity, to the floor of the Senate.  We support $2,000 as a helping hand to people across the United  States. There is a limitation on the amount that individuals receive if  they make more than $75,000 or if their family makes more than  $150,000, but we are following the template that has been employed both  with the CARES Act and with our own COVID relief act of just a few days  ago.  We have been told by the Department of the Treasury that if you want  to put money into the hands of Americans who desperately need it, this  is the best way to do it, the quickest way to do it. There are better  ways, I am sure, but in a time of crisis, we need to respond and  respond in a timely way.  So Senator Sanders and Senator Schumer have brought to the floor for  consideration, we hope, a bill that has already passed the House of  Representatives. The significance of this is that the House is now in  recess and not scheduled to return in this congressional session. So  whatever happens over here cannot be a new bill--there is no House to  send it to and no time to pass it--but, rather, has to be an up-or-down  vote on a bill that has passed the House as is. That is what they have  come to the floor now for 3 straight days asking.  Senator Schumer has asked repeatedly of Senator McConnell, the  Republican leader, a simple request: Whether you are for the House bill  or against the House bill, allow the Senate to be the Senate. Allow us  to vote on the bill--for those of us who support it, to vote on it.  It isn't a lock; it isn't guaranteed that we are going to win and  prevail with that vote. There are 48 Democratic Senators, and you need  60 votes. We need help from the other side. Four or five Republican  Senators say they support it as well, but we don't know if we have the  12, if all of our Members can be here. In this era of COVID-19, sadly,  even some of our Senators have illnesses in the family, which may make  it impossible for them to be here. So there is no guarantee we win, but  there will be a guarantee that we are recorded and our positions are  known to the voters across America. That is a simple request. Yet, time  and again, the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, has said no.  I am worried about what is happening to this institution, not just in  this instance but with what we have seen over the past several years.  We will conclude this calendar year having voted on the floor of this  U.S. Senate 29 times on amendments--29 in the course of a year in what  is supposedly the world's greatest deliberative body. I guess I  shouldn't complain--it is a 30-percent increase over last year, when we  voted on 22 amendments in the entire calendar year. The Senate is out  of business and out to lunch when it comes to legislating, and that is  a fact.  All we are asking for is the chance to legislate a $2,000 helping  hand to families across America. I have heard over and over again that  we are just trying to featherbed the rich, that we are trying to give  big checks to rich people. Well, Senator Sanders made a point on that  earlier. Less than 1 percent of the money we are asking for is going to  go to the top 5 percent.  When it came time for tax policy and tax breaks, many of the people  complaining the loudest about $2,000 were giving away millions of  dollars to the richest people in America without any hesitation. Well,  today is another day, and today is a different America. Today, we are  facing a country that is in the depths of the crisis created by COVID- 19. The numbers coming back to us every night on the news are  heartbreaking numbers.  I understand--and most of us do--that those wonderful women and men  who are in the healthcare business usually are very stoic and calm in  reporting the reality of their lives. Not so anymore. More and more  doctors and nurses are breaking down on television as they describe the  scenes in emergency rooms across this country. They describe the  reality of telling families that they cannot be by the bedside of one  of their loved ones who is about to die, and they break down in tears  and tell us they don't know how much more of this they can take.  That is the reality of America. It is not an America of vastly rich  people sitting by the swimming pool hoping Congress sends them more  money; it is an America of those patients and their families and the  people who are out of [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7989\">Page S7989</a>, ] work and the business men and women who have lost everything, who need  a hand from this government.  If there is one thing about America, I hope it is clear, no matter  what your political persuasion, we are a caring people. If a hurricane  hits Florida, I care about it. If a tornado hits the State of Nebraska,  I care about it. And we come together on a bipartisan basis to help  those families. Now more than ever, those families need us to do  something significant in their lives. How can you see the scenes on  television every night of the parade of cars lined up in Texas, in  Kentucky, in Illinois, hoping they can get some food to give to their  families? Are those grifters and chiselers who are just trying to get a  free meal? I don't think so. Would you sit in your car for an hour or  two for food unless you really needed it? I think those people really  need it. Many of them are heartbroken that they are in this situation.  Some are even embarrassed--and they shouldn't be--that they have been  the victims of this economy.  So all we are asking, Senator McConnell, is, give us a chance to  vote. You can vote no if you wish. Give us a chance to vote for the  $2,000 that can make a difference in a person's life; $4,000 for a  husband and wife who are struggling to get by--rent checks, mortgage  payments, car payments, utility bills, things that really are basic to  families' survival. We are trying to help, and I think we should be  given that chance.  We have tried time and again. We have the support of President Trump  in this effort, and I am glad to have it. I think we have enough  support in this Chamber to come up with 60 votes. I pray that we will,  if we are given that chance, and I hope the Senate Republican leader is  not afraid of that outcome. He shouldn't be.  He has two of his incumbent Republican Senators in a runoff election  who have both publicly said they want to vote for this, and yet he  stops them. He is the one who has put an end to their opportunity. Why?  Shouldn't he give them the opportunity to vote yes? He even refuses, in  this situation, with this looming election, to bring this matter to the  floor for an honest up-or-down, bipartisan vote.  I listened to the stories that were told by Senator Sanders and  others about the plight of people in this country and how much they  count on us and, frankly, how many of them have given up on us. They  just don't believe the Congress of the United States is in touch with  the reality of America.  If we are in touch with the reality in our home States, in our home  towns, we should do something--something significant--to end this year  on the right note.  I plead with the Republican leader, who has the power. The sole  Member of Congress of 100 Members--he has the power to bring this  matter to a vote and to do it immediately, within the hour. We could  call the Members who returned to Washington yesterday together, take a  vote soon, in a matter of minutes, and know once and for all whether we  have the 60 votes that are necessary to pass this measure. Then we can  pass the override of the President's veto of the Defense authorization  bill--a critical piece of legislation.  That would be the right way to end this year. Let us not end it in  suspense as to whether or not we are going to come to the aid and  assistance of American families who rely on us time and again to be  there when America needs a helping hand. Let's do our job. Let's fill  this Chamber with Senators who will actually vote on an issue that  makes a difference in the lives of Americans. That is what we were  elected to do. We have no excuse if we fail.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    ", "Mr. CARDIN": " Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the end of a Congress is a bittersweet  time. We reflect with pride on our accomplishments but have a sense of  wistfulness with respect to the things we have been unable to do. We  look forward to the holidays, spending more time with our families, and  having a bit of a respite. But we have to say good-bye to several  colleagues. I would like to take a few moments to pay tribute to  Senators who will not be returning when the 117th Congress convenes.  They are my friends as well as my colleagues and I will miss them and  the unique attributes, skill, and devotion to public service they have  brought to the Senate.  Senator Cory Gardner is a fifth generation Coloradan firmly rooted in  the State's Eastern Plains whose family has been in the farm implement  business for over one century. He received his undergraduate degree  from Colorado State University, where he graduated summa cum laude, and  his Juris Doctor from the University of Colorado at Boulder.  While Senator Gardner has only been in the Senate since 2015, the  expression ``got it in one'' certainly applies to him. Perhaps that is  because he previously worked in the Senate for then-Senator Wayne  Allard, quickly rising to become Senator Allard's legislative director.  He served for 6 years in the Colorado House of Representatives and  another 4 years in the U.S. House of Representatives before being  elected to the Senate in 2014.  Here in the Senate, Senator Gardner has been a serious legislator but  with a cheerful and affable and civil manner. He has worked to bridge  partisan divides, particularly on energy policy, where he has been one  of the Republicans' leading advocates of renewable energy. This year,  the esteemed Lugar Center ranked Senator Gardner as the third most  bipartisan Senator.  I have had the opportunity to work with Senator Gardner on the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee as he led the effort to impose sanctions  against North Korea in his role as chairman of the Foreign Relations  Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity  Policy. Through the committee, we also worked together to introduce  legislation to enhance American maritime capacity and leadership and  increase support to our allies in the Asia-Pacific region, the Asia- Pacific Maritime Security Initiative Act of 2016. I was also pleased to  work with Senator Gardner in 2019 to introduce the Wildlife Refuge  System Protection Act, bipartisan legislation to provide legal  authority for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service--USFWS--to seek  damages for injury or harm on National Wildlife Refuges, National Fish  Hatcheries, and other USFWS lands and waters.  My wife Myrna and I have traveled with Senator Gardner and his wife  Jaime to promote human rights abroad. His commitment to global human  rights was crystal clear to Myrna and me. I will miss Senator Gardner  and his pleasant demeanor, but he is still a young man so I am  confident he will find new ways to continue serving all Americans, but  especially the Coloradans he has represented with distinction for the  past 16 years. I wish him, Jaime, and their children Alyson, Thatcher,  and Caitlyn all the best.  Senator Martha McSally has only been in the Senate for 2 years, but  it is impossible not to be in awe of her true [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7874\">Page S7874</a>, ] grit and determination, perhaps stemming from being the youngest of  five children. Her father died when she was just 12, leaving her mother  to raise and support her family. Perhaps it was the example her mother  set--Senator McSally was determined to let nothing stand in her way.  She was the valedictorian of her high school and earned an appointment  to the United States Air Force Academy, where she received a bachelor's  of science in biology. I am privileged to represent the U.S. Naval  Academy in Annapolis, MD. I have served on the board of visitors, and  my staff and I interview the hundreds of young applicants across  Maryland who aspire to enroll in one of our service academies each  year. I am not sure most Americans are aware of how intensely  competitive these positions are and what a tremendous honor earning an  appointment is. Meeting these applicants, reviewing their extraordinary  accomplishments at such a young age, and seeing their commitment to  service--willing to put their lives on the line, if necessary--restores  one's faith in the boundless future of our Nation.  Senator McSally certainly put her life on the line for us and  shattered gender barriers along the way. She became the first woman in  American history to fly a fighter jet in combat and the first woman to  command a fighter squadron in combat. She deployed six times to the  Middle East. She helped lead and execute the initial air campaign in  Afghanistan after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and she supervised combat  search and rescue operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. In total, she  flew 325 combat hours and earned a Bronze Star and six air medals. She  served in the U.S. Air Force for 26 years, retiring as a full colonel.  Senator McSally has never been one to rest on her laurels. She earned  masters' degrees from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of  Government and the U.S. Air War College, graduating first in her class  of 261 senior military officers. She ran for the House of  Representatives, first unsuccessfully by a narrow margin in 2012 but  then successfully--again by a narrow margin--in 2014, becoming the  first Republican woman to represent Arizona in Congress. She was  reelected in 2016. She lost a tough race to Senator Sinema in 2018, but  Arizona Governor Doug Ducey appointed her to finish the unexpired term  of another war hero, our late friend Senator John McCain.  Unfortunately, I had little opportunity to work with Senator McSally  during her 2 years here in the Senate, although I did travel with her  to Normandy for the 75th anniversary of D-Day, and I saw firsthand her  commitment to America's service men and women--especially military  sexual assault survivors--to veterans, and to military families.  Senator McSally is an inspiration to all of us, but especially to women  and girls, for her devotion to duty and the incredible odds she has  overcome and the barriers she has broken in her life. Senator McSally  has said, ``There's always more that unites us than divides us.'' I  agree wholeheartedly with that sentiment. She is a fighter who will  continue to fight for our county, and I am grateful for that.  Senator Doug Jones is a native Alabaman, a steelworker's son, who  grew up during the great struggle for civil rights and desegregation in  the South. He has been involved in that struggle all of his life,  active in campus affairs at the University of Alabama, where he earned  his bachelor's degree in 1976, and in trying to modernize Alabama's  court system.  Senator Jones has the distinction of working, being confirmed by, and  being elected to serve in the U.S. Senate. After he graduated from  Cumberland Law School at Samford University in 1979, he worked as a  staff counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee for then-Senator Howell  Heflin. Senator Jones served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney from 1980 to  1984. After he worked in private practice for several years, President  Clinton nominated him to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the Northern  District of Alabama, and the Senate confirmed his nomination in 1997.  While Senator Jones was the U.S. Attorney, he successfully prosecuted  two of the four men who were responsible for the heinous bombing of the  16th Street Baptist Church in 1963, an attack that killed four young  Black girls between the ages of 11 and 14 and shocked the conscience of  our Nation. He prosecuted other domestic terrorists, including the Ku  Klux Klan and Eric Rudolph. He won a hard-fought special election to  the Senate in December 2017 and has served with honor, distinction, and  a commitment to finding bipartisan solutions to our Nation's most- pressing problems.  Senator Jones has fought to protect healthcare and to create equal  opportunities for all Americans. He led the passage of the bipartisan  FUTURE Act into law last year, legislation that I strongly supported to  provide permanent funding for historically Black colleges and  universities and minority-serving institutions. He has also championed  minority-serving financial institutions and minority-owned banks,  supporting the efforts to add additional funds for these institutions  through the Paycheck Protection Program. I was proud to work with  Senator Jones on the successful passage of our legislation to extend  the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act this year, which extends  until 2030 duty-free access for certain textile goods from 23 Caribbean  countries that are made with U.S. yarns, fabrics, and threads until  2030.  Senator Jones is equally committed to civility and civil rights. As  the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., so famously said, ``The arc  or the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.'' Thanks to  Senator Jones' abiding faith and ceaseless efforts, that arc is bending  faster. I wish him, his wife Louise, their children Carson,  Christopher, and Courtney, and their two grandchildren all the best  moving forward. I know he will continue to serve our country, and I am  hopeful it will be as a member of the incoming administration of  President-Elect Joe Biden.  Senator Tom Udall comes from an illustrious extended family with a  long history of distinguished public service, including his father  Stewart, who served as Secretary of the Interior under President John  F. Kennedy and Lyndon Baines Johnson from 1961 to 1969. His uncle  Morris ``Mo'' K. Udall was one of the most accomplished and beloved  Congressmen in U.S. history, representing Arizona's Second District for  30 years. While Senator Udall was born in Tucson, he has deep roots in  New Mexico, starting with his grandmother Luna, who was born in New  Mexico Territory.  Senator Udall earned his undergraduate degree from Prescott College,  a bachelor of laws degree from Cambridge, and J.D. from the University  of New Mexico in 1977. And then joining the family tradition, he began  his public service by clerking for the Honorable Oliver Seth, chief  justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Later, he  became a Federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's criminal division  and chief counsel to the New Mexico Department of Health and  Environment.  Senator Udall was elected New Mexico Attorney General in 1990 and  reelected in 1994. He made his mark in several areas, but especially in  government transparency and ethics, a quest he would continue in the  U.S. House of Representatives, where he served five highly productive  terms, even though he was in the minority for four of them, passing  legislation to establish a national renewable energy standard.  Here in the Senate, Senator Udall has continued his distinguished  service for two terms in his low-key, quiet, understated, and effective  manner. Just this year, he led the passage of the Great American  Outdoors Act to fund our national parks and Federal land agencies. He  has championed environmental justice and has devoted himself to  rectifying the injustices our Nation has perpetrated against Indian  Nations and Tribes. Senator Udall has remained steadfast in his  commitment to good and transparent government as the lead Senate  sponsor of the For the People Act.  I have been privileged to work closely with Senator Udall on the  Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as the  U.S. Helsinki Commission, and on the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee. We have focused on strengthening our relationships with our  allies, which President Trump has put to the test, promoting American  values around the world, and [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7875\">Page S7875</a>, ] fostering human rights and international development and conservation  efforts.  I will greatly miss Senator Udall here in the Senate but feel  fortunate to have served with him these last 12 years in the Senate and  for 8 years together in the House of Representatives before that. New  Mexicans and all Americans have benefited greatly from his 30 years in  elected office and lifetime of public service. He has honorably and  effectively continued his family's noble tradition of stewardship in  all regards. My wife Myrna and Senator Udall's wife Jill, a tireless  advocate on behalf of the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American  Indian, have become good friends, and Myrna and I will miss both of  them. I wish them and their daughter Amanda all the best.  Senator Mike Enzi was born in Bremerton, WA, where his father was  working in the naval shipyard during World War II. He grew up in  Thermopolis, WY. He came to Washington, DC, for college, earning his  bachelor's degree in accounting from George Washington University in  1966. He began his public service in the Wyoming Air National Guard  from 1967 to 1973. Later, he worked in the U.S. Department of the  Interior, earned a master's degree from the University of Denver, ran  his father's show business, and became mayor of Gillette, WY, when he  was just 30.  Senator Enzi served in the Wyoming House of Representatives for 4  years and in the Wyoming Senate for 6 years before being elected to the  U.S. Senate in 1996 with 54 percent of the vote. That was the closest  election he has had; he garnered over 70 percent of the vote each time  he sought reelection.  Senator Enzi is one of the most conservative members of the Senate  but that has not prevented him from reaching across the aisle. He is  quiet but his accomplishments speak volumes. While he chaired the  Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, it reported 37  bills, 23 of which the Senate passed. As he likes to say, ``People can  agree on 80 percent of the issues 80 percent of the time, and if they  leave the other 20 percent out they can get a lot done.'' He has  authored more than 100 bills that Presidents of both parties have  signed into law.  Senator Enzi and I have served on the Senate Finance Committee  together since the 112th Congress, and on the Subcommittee on Health  Care, where we have worked together to find bipartisan solutions to  expand access to affordable, quality healthcare. We have also worked  together to ensure the stability and health of pension funds, including  recent efforts related to the multiemployer union pension crisis, and  to bolster financial literacy. I have also been pleased to work with  Senator Enzi on legislation to ensure prompt payments to small  businesses working as Federal contractors across the Department of  Defense, and on our Collegiate Housing and Infrastructure Act, to help  student groups with collegiate housing costs.  Senator Enzi's grandfatherly mien and calm disposition have helped  steer the Senate through rocky times, and I will miss his steady hand  on our rudder. My wife Myrna will miss his wife of 51 years, Diana, an  active member of the Senate Spouses Club, who also works to provide  specially trained dogs and handlers to countries infested with  landmines. Senator Enzi is an avid hunter and fly fisherman, and I know  he will enjoy the opportunity to spend more time with Diana; their  children Amy, Emily, and Brad; and their four grandchildren.  Senator Pat Roberts is a native Kansan from Topeka and a  quintessential plainspoken Midwesterner and ex-marine. He is a fourth  generation Kansan, whose great-grandfather, J.W. Roberts, founded the  ``Oskaloosa Independent,'' the State's second oldest newspaper. Senator  Roberts has journalism and public service coursing though his blood. He  earned his bachelor's degree in journalism from Kansas State University  and then served in the U.S. Marine Corps for 4 years before working as  a reporter and then editor of several newspapers in Arizona. In 1967,  Senator Roberts worked for then-U.S. Senator Frank Carlson. In 1969, he  became administrative assistant to then-U.S. Representative Keith  Sibelius, who represented the First District.  Senator Roberts went on to represent the First District himself for  16 years before being elected to the Senate in 1996, where he has  continued to serve with distinction for four terms. Senator Roberts has  a well-earned reputation as a national leader on agriculture, defense,  and healthcare issues. He has the distinction of being the first person  in history to have chaired both the House and Senate Committees on  Agriculture and to author and pass bipartisan farm bills in both  Chambers. He led the passage of the overwhelmingly bipartisan 2018 farm  bill, which benefited farmers in my home State of Maryland and around  the Nation. As cochairman of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, Senator  Roberts has sought to address the challenges that rural communities  face in terms of access to high-quality healthcare.  While Senator Roberts chaired the Senate Select Committee on  Intelligence, he conducted one of the most thorough reviews of U.S.  intelligence gathering and analysis in the wake of the faulty  intelligence leading to the war in Iraq. The committee unanimously  issued the bipartisan report, which frankly and forthrightly revealed  systemic failures and provided numerous recommendations included in the  9/11 Intelligence Reform Act of 2004.  Senator Roberts has played a pivotal role in the creation of two  wonderful monuments, one here in Washington, DC, and the other in his  beloved Kansas. He served as Chairman of the Dwight David Eisenhower  Memorial Commission--and that fine memorial on Independence Avenue to  Kansas's favorite son was dedicated earlier this year--a fitting  capstone to Senator Roberts' 40 years as an elected official. Back in  Kansas, he helped to establish the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve, one of  the most beautiful and majestic places in America. Tallgrass prairie  once stretched from Canada to Mexico, covering more than 170 million  acres. Today, less than 4 percent of it remains intact, mostly in the  Kansas Flint Hills, largely thanks to the efforts of Senator Roberts.  I have had the opportunity to work with Senator Roberts on  agricultural and healthcare issues, and legislation to encourage  retirement savings by fostering the growth of S corporations owned by  Employee Stock Ownership Plans--``S-ESOPS''. I will miss working with  him and his Semper Fi, ``can-do'' approach to problem-solving, but I  know he is looking forward to spending more time with his wife Franki;  their three children, David, Ashleigh, and Anne-Wesley; and their seven  grandchildren.  Senator Lamar Alexander has had a career in public service as long,  varied, and distinguished as just about any other American, working or  serving in all three branches of the Federal Government. He is a  seventh generation east Tennessean whose father was an elementary  school principal and mother was a pre-school teacher--thus began  Senator Alexander's lifelong interest in education. He graduated from  Vanderbilt University with a B.A. in 1962 and was elected to Phi Beta  Kappa. He earned his J.D. from New York University in 1965, was editor  of the law review, and a Root-Tilden Scholar.  Senator Alexander began his public service as a clerk for the  Honorable John Minor Wisdom on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth  Circuit. He worked on the staff of then-U.S. Senator Howard Baker and  as staff assistant to then-President Richard Nixon. In 1978, he walked  1,022 miles across Tennessee, spent the night with 73 different  families, and won election as Governor. As Governor, he helped to bring  the auto industry to the State. He was reelected in 1982 and served as  chair of the National Governors' Association from 1985 to 1986. He was  president of the University of Tennessee from 1988 to 1991, then- President George H.W. Bush's Secretary of Education from 1991 to 1993,  and a Professor of Practice in Public Service at Harvard the Kennedy  School of Government from 2001 to 2003. Somehow, he has also found the  time to cofound a law firm and two successful businesses, be a  classical and country pianist who has performed on the Grand Old Opry  and with symphony orchestras, and author seven books.  While Senator Alexander chaired the HELP Committee, it reported 45 [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7876\">Page S7876</a>, ] bills that became law, most of which he authored. He sponsored the  America Competes Act of 2007; the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015,  greatly benefitting students in my home State of Maryland and  nationwide; the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016; and the Opioid Crisis  Response Act of 2018. He also authored legislation to modernize how  songwriters are compensated for their works. The list goes on and on.  Senator Alexander has been a champion of higher education reform,  seeking to simplify the process of applying for financial aid and to  increase access for all students. I have been proud to work with him to  support and strengthen historically Black colleges and universities and  minority serving institutions. On the environmental front, I had the  opportunity to work with Senator Alexander on legislation to end the  dumping of mining waste into streams, the Appalachia Restoration Act of  2009.  Senator Alexander is always courteous, an ``eloquent listener,'' and  always eager to forge bipartisan solutions to our Nation's problems.  Just a few days ago, I know Senators and staff were delighted to listen  to him play Christmas carols and hymns on the piano in the Hart atrium.  We will greatly miss his calm and dignified presence in the Senate, but  he has certainly earned the opportunity to spend more time with his  beloved wife of 51 years, Honey; their children Leslee, Kathryn,  Andrew, and William; and their nine grandchildren.  Senators Enzi, Roberts, and Alexander have served in this institution  for 66 years combined. Senator Udall has served 12 years, and Senator  Gardner has served 6 years. Senators Jones and McSally did not have an  opportunity to serve a full term, but all told, we are losing close to  90 years of dedicated service to the institution, our colleagues, their  constituents, and all Americans. There is a tradition for departing  Senators to give a farewell address, and most use the opportunity to  bemoan the fact that the Senate has become less collegial and more  partisan. I share that discontent and sadness. I think the best way we  can pay appropriate tribute to the fine Members who are leaving at the  end of this Congress is by rededicating ourselves to preserving and  expanding on their legacy of bipartisanship. I want to express my deep  admiration of and appreciation to Senators Alexander, Enzi, Gardner,  Jones, McSally, Roberts, and Udall. I am grateful for the opportunity  to serve with and learn from them, and I cherish our friendships    ", "Mr. THUNE": " Mr. THUNE. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn), the Senator from Arkansas (Mr.  Cotton), the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Gardner), the Senator from  South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Georgia (Mrs. Loeffler),  the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Perdue), and the Senator from Florida  (Mr. Rubio).    ", "Mr. BROWN": " Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of revisionist history  this afternoon.  Look back in March, when Congress did the right thing and the Senate  voted unanimously. Because of our efforts, 13 million people were kept  out of poverty--we know that--because we provided relatively generous  unemployment insurance. We did the direct payments. We helped with  small business loans. But then this Senate thought its work was done  for the year. We begged Senator McConnell month after month after month  to come back and help.  As I said, 13 million people were kept out of poverty because of the  work this Congress did in March of this year, but now, since--many of  those benefits, especially the unemployment benefit and the direct  payments, were not continued, of course. Those benefits expired in  August, and we have seen 8 million people drop into poverty in this  country since. Yet Senator McConnell refuses and refuses and refuses  I hear this revisionist history that Democrats just want to help  people who are already affluent and give them more money. Well,  remember back in March, the only amendment that we considered, the only  amendment that Senator McConnell allowed on the floor of the Senate to  the CARES Act, the only amendment was to take away the $600-a-week  unemployment insurance. The only place Republicans fought was the $600- a-week unemployment insurance. That more than any single thing we did  is why people were kept out of poverty. Now the best we could do was  $300-a-week unemployment insurance--the best we could do. In spite of  Senator Cornyn's and others' comments, Senator McConnell waited,  waited, waited, and waited. Finally, we were able to do that.  The President of the United States threatened to veto it, causing  millions of Americans to fall off their unemployment insurance. We know  all that. It is just important to remember all that.  But there is one simple question before the Senate this week: Are we  going to put more money into people's pockets? The American people made  it clear on election day that they want a government that is on their  side. This is our chance to deliver for them, to show people whom we  serve that we can make a real difference in their lives, which we did  back in March.  It is pretty simple. The best way to help Ohio workers and families  is to put more money in their pockets, not in the bank accounts of the  largest corporations and biggest banks, hoping it will trickle down. We  know it never does. The CEOs just pay themselves instead.  We know that just recently there was more good news for American CEOs  who are able again to do stock buybacks, more dividend distributions. A  lot of corporations have made a lot of money--more power to them-- during this pandemic, but those are the corporations that continue to  get the big tax breaks.  We need, instead, to directly invest in people who make this country  work. It helps people pay the bills and stay in their homes and get  through this downturn. It injects money into local economies that  really need it. The more money people have, the more they spend in  small businesses that are hurting.  We know this works. It did in the spring. We came together. We  crossed the aisle, passed the CARES Act, expanded unemployment, and  provided direct stimulus checks, keeping 13 million people out of  poverty. The bill we passed last week was a good step in that  direction, but we should make it stronger.  Back in March, my original plan that I tried to negotiate as I sat  with Secretary Mnuchin and a handful of other Senators was $2,000 per  person, adults and children. We called for it to be sent automatically  throughout the year, every quarter, as long as we remained in a public  health emergency.  It is clear now what we could have done and should have done. No one  could predict how long this crisis would last. Today, we still aren't  sure when everybody will be vaccinated and when the economy will return  to full strength. We don't want to sit idly by. We don't want to wonder  how bad it could get. We are the strongest, richest country on Earth.  We have the resources to do something about it; we just need leadership  willing to use every tool we have.  If they refuse to support this $2,000 per person, if they refuse to  support these direct payments, Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans  will again make it perfectly clear to the American people whose side  they are on.  Every time there is a fork in the road and Senator McConnell and  Senate Republicans have to make a decision--either go with corporate  interests or go with working families--every single time, they choose  corporate interests. They had no problem pouring money into corporate  coffers with their tax cut and blowing up the deficit.  Just down the hall here in Senator McConnell's office, I remember  lobbyists lining up, looking for those tax cuts back 3 years ago, and  they got those tax cuts. They didn't say anything about government  deficits back then--$1.5 trillion added to the deficit. They didn't  mind that because that was money going into their contributors'  pockets, into big corporate coffers [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7980\">Page S7980</a>, ] for the wealthiest people in this country. They were all too happy to  let the government shovel loans to the biggest banks and companies. But  in the middle of the worst crisis of our lifetime, faced with the  chance to give money directly to ordinary Americans, my colleagues  claim we can't afford it. That is just simply a lie. We are the richest  country on Earth.  I remember Bill Spriggs--an economist at Howard University--told the  Banking and Housing Committee in September: We didn't win World War II  by worrying about whether or not we could afford it. We were in a  global crisis. We marshalled all our vast resources and talents to rise  to meet it. We grew the economy from the middle class out. We paid down  the debt with rising wages.  If we have learned anything from the crisis, it should be that we can  do the same again. Americans are tired of being told we can't. It is  the only answer that Senator McConnell and Senate Republicans ever have  for most people's problems: We can't help you. We can't solve your  problem. You are on your own.  Let's aim higher. Let's deliver for the people we serve. Let's put  $2,000 into their pockets--money that will make such a difference for  so many families. It will help a mother worried about how she will pay  back rent. It will keep a laid off restaurant worker from turning to a  payday lender. It will allow a father to buy a new computer so his kids  are better able to learn online. These are millions of real people-- people we swore an oath to serve who would breathe a little easier this  new year if we pass this.  So let's be clear about the decision today and this week before the  Senate. Are we going to give the people we serve $2,000, or are you  going to stand in the way? It is that simple. Let's come together.  Let's pass this. Let's make a real difference in people's lives.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    ", "Mr. BLUMENTHAL": " Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, we are here in the waning hours of  2020, expectant and hopeful about the coming year, and I want to wish  all of my colleagues a very healthy and happy new year in the hope that  we will fulfill the promise of our constituents, our country, our  Constitution in moving forward to meet and conquer the pandemic that  still ravages our Nation and to renew our economy that still is  failing.  We are the greatest Nation in the history of the world, and Americans  are hurting. This body has taken positive and important steps toward  meeting this public health and economic crisis, as well as the hurt and  harm that continue to plague Americans.  In a number of important relief packages, we have helped to meet  those needs and enabled the Nation to bridge the gap created by this  pandemic--an economic gap that has become a chasm, a cliff that seems  without end and, for many of our fellow citizens, a time of  unparalleled and unanticipated pain.  The relief package that we passed most recently--I think we can be  proud to say--is the second largest in our Nation's history, and it  will provide a second round of paycheck protection loans, forgivable,  becoming grants, so that small businesses can keep their doors open;  more aid for our transportation and education systems; money to  distribute the vaccine that will be a lifesaver for so many Americans;  and other important aid, including a $600 stimulus payment for every  American who is making less than $75,000. That is real assistance for a  family of four--$2,400--because every child, as well as adult, will  receive that money.  But all of that $906 billion is only a downpayment. It is a life  raft, and it has to be followed by an even more robust, bigger, bolder  package to provide real relief and sustenance for the survival of our  economy and, literally, the survival of Americans who are struggling to  put food on the table and to buy medicine, pay rent and mortgages,  clothe their children.  We have all told our stories on the floor of the Senate during 2020  about constituents waiting in food lines, hurting for the funds needed  to stay in their home or apartment and to pay for the medicine that is  literally a matter of life and death.  We have told those stories. We have talked about Americans who are  struggling. We have the opportunity now to do something about it, so I  appeal to my Republican colleague very bluntly and simply: Give us a  vote on the CASH Act. Let us vote on a stand-alone $2,000 stimulus  payment bill. Allow every one of us to go on record on that $2,000  stimulus payment bill that would add $1,400 to that $600 already  provided--not to minimize the importance of $600, but it is  inadequate. It is insufficient. It is unacceptable because it fails to  provide the basic needs to meet the desperate and dire straits of so  many Americans.  We are talking about families who need that money to buy bread and  milk, paper towels and toilet paper, goods and services that are  necessary to the survival of their families. Six hundred dollars is  simply not enough, and that is why I call on my fellow colleagues to  persuade their leaders that we should be permitted this vote, because I  believe that if there is a vote, it will pass. Having spoken to  Republican colleagues here, I have no doubt--none--that the stand-alone  $2,000 stimulus payment measure would pass overwhelmingly, just as did  the $600 payment as part of the larger bill.  The simple fact is, that measure is the only viable vehicle. Any  other measure loaded with other provisions, whether it is the section  230 reform or a commission to investigate the last election on  fictitious fraud, is doomed. It is doomed logistically. It is doomed  legally and physically. There is no way for the House to pass it.  Only the House bill, if passed, can provide Americans with the $2,000  stimulus payment that they so desperately need. Only the House bill  provides that relief. Any other measure will be doomed because the  House cannot come back to pass it in the time we have left in this  session. So the majority leader is essentially blocking a step that  will literally save lives, supported by the vast majority of the  American people, a significant part of his own conference, and every  Democrat.  Have no doubt--every Democrat will vote for it. We clamored for a  higher stimulus payment for months when the majority leader refused to  come to the table and then when the President of the United States  failed to lift a finger--he was on the golf course--when it [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7990\">Page S7990</a>, ] might have made a difference in raising that $600 amount higher during  the negotiating.  Looking forward, there is a way to provide this relief to Americans  without leaving here in a contest of blame but in a new year of mutual  congratulation. Pass the $2,000 stimulus payment plan as a stand-alone,  clean bill.  I just want to say that I am probably the only Senator who has  supported two measures--one of them actually passed by the Congress and  signed by the President to reform section 230 and the other unanimously  voted out of the Judiciary Committee. They reformed section 230, and I  support reforming section 230. I have hardly been uncritical of section  230. There should be major reform of section 230, but it has to be done  in a careful, deliberate, and considered way as a separate measure, not  as a meat ax in a totally unrelated bill, the $2,000 payment bill that  provides real relief for the country.  Loading the CASH Act with poison pills is obstruction. It is not  constructive legislating, and it fails to meet the test of this moment.  It is vital that we move forward to provide struggling Americans with  this relief, and scuttling the $2,000 stimulus payment bill with a  half-baked, meat-ax evisceration of section 230 is cruel and downright  stupid. It betrays the mission and obligation that we have in these  waning days of 2020.  Americans need more help, and they need hope. Help and hope are  embodied in the vaccine. Unfortunately, the rollout of this vaccine,  despite the $8 billion contained in the latest pandemic relief bill,  has been hopelessly behind schedule. The number of doses distributed is  roughly one-tenth of what it should be even under the scaled-back  schedule that this administration has adopted. Twenty million  vaccinations were promised by the end of the year. That number was way  below the initial promise, and only about one-tenth of them--probably 2  million--will actually be provided.  Instead of taking responsibility or taking control, President Trump  is still tweeting; instead of action, more talk. Only action will save  lives, and either he doesn't care enough, or he doesn't really see what  is necessary to do in order to save these lives, because the  distribution of this vaccine is a matter of life and death.  Using the Defense Production Act, mobilizing America, making sure  States have the resources they need, providing money to hospitals, and  making sure there are the vials, syringes, training for workers, as  well as the facilities to transport, store, and distribute this  vaccine, are essential now. They are missing at this moment, and the  President is where the buck stops.  Now I look forward to a 2021 when a new President will expand the  stimulus payments to individuals and when many of the other gaps left  unfinished--action that still is necessary--will be fulfilled by  another, more robust, bigger, bolder pandemic relief program. I hope we  will have the same bipartisan support that we saw at the end of this  year for the latest. I hope we will overcome the divisions that  prevented us from doing what is really necessary and adding $1,400 to  the $600 already provided.  We need to do more for small businesses. Yes, there will be another  round of PPP payments, but this chasm faced by restaurants, retailers,  and small businesses struggling to keep their doors open, keep their  people on payroll during the holidays--we have seen them all and talked  to them. Their stories are riveting and heartbreaking. Businesspeople  have poured their hearts and souls and lives into these businesses,  only to see them threatened with extinction.  This crisis has a racial justice aspect that cannot be ignored  because disproportionately, the businesses that have failed are Black-  and Brown-owned. Disproportionately, the lives lost have been in Black  and Brown communities. Disproportionately, the jobs lost have been in  those same communities--Black and Brown communities that have suffered  more than any other as a result of this pandemic. So we need to make  sure that they receive the vaccine as well as the therapeutics and  testing that are necessary to save lives.  We are in the midst of a racial justice moment that affects policing  and criminal justice, but it also affects our schools, where the ZIP  Code of a child's residence can mean the difference between a quality  education or not; where Black and Brown communities suffer twice or  three times the death rate of others as a result of this pandemic;  where job discrimination still exists and where, in housing, redlining  still afflicts these communities; and where environmental quality-- rivers, lakes, air can still be disproportionately contaminated and  polluted in communities inhabited by Black and Brown people.  We are here in the last day of an unprecedented and catastrophic  year. More than 342,000 of our fellow Americans are dead as a result of  this insidious virus--over 342,000 gifts unwrapped, places at the table  left open, and many of them without a final goodbye. This past year  will go down as one of the hardest in our history.  I think we all hope for a better year, but it will come only if we  take the kind of action that apparently my Republican colleagues are  failing to provide today, which is to meet the need to match the moment  of the desperate and dire straits of so many Americans.  The failure to approve an additional $1,400 and pass the CASH Act is  a haunting omission. My hope is that the hopes of a hurting nation will  be met in this new year, that the calls for justice and relief will be  heard, and that the ailing and sick--not just physically but  emotionally--will be met. This crisis has been one of physical health  care but also mental health care, and the emotional strains can be seen  in the rising rates of domestic violence, substance abuse disorder and  addiction, and so many other areas where mental and emotional stress  and anxiety have taken a toll. The hopes of a fearful and grieving  nation rests on our shoulders, and we cannot let them down.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. GARDNER": " Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory call be waived.    ", "Ms. COLLINS": " Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Daines joining me to  clarify the intent of the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of  2019. This legislation, which Senator Daines has introduced with  Senator Leahy, would modify the McCarran-Ferguson Act by eliminating  the health insurance industry's exemption from Federal antitrust laws.  That sounds like a good idea, but it has implications for longstanding  State regulation of the insurance industry.  States have had the primary responsibility for the regulation of  health insurance since the 1940s. Given my past experience as  commissioner of Maine's Department of Professional and Financial  Regulation, I know firsthand that State insurance regulators do a good  job of responding to the needs and concerns of their insurance  consumers. To protect consumers, State insurance [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7967\">Page S7967</a>, ] regulators hold probing hearings on rate requests which often lead to  lower rates being approved. Most State insurance regulators have  consumer protection advocates who resolve disputes between insurers and  individual consumers. State regulators do not tolerate unfair or  anticompetitive practices. As the National Association of Insurance  Commissioners wrote to the leaders of the Senate and the Senate  Judiciary Committee, ``The potential for bid rigging, price-fixing and  market allocation is of great concern to state insurance regulators and  we share your view that such practices would be harmful to consumers  and should not be tolerated. However, we want to assure you that these  activities are not permitted under state law. Indeed, the state  insurance regulators in all states actively enforce their antitrust  rules and review rates to ensure they are actuarially justified,  sufficient for solvency and nondiscriminatory.''  Based on this experience, I have consistently raised concerns about  legislation that could interfere with the current State-level  regulation of insurance and could ultimately harm Maine consumers and  smaller insurers. These concerns extend to the Competitive Health  Insurance Reform Act.  While the bill does not directly modify the portion of McCarran- Ferguson that affirms State regulatory authority, it, however, does add  a layer of Federal review, and we need to ensure that in doing so we do  not create increased confusion, cost, and possible conflicts between  State and Federal efforts.  This is why it is very important to make clear Congress's intent that  along with the changes specified in the bill, it is Congress's  expectation that the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade  Commission must notify State bureaus of insurance and attorneys general  of any complaints or investigations they have received or are  performing that involve entities in their state. I appreciate Senator  Daines' willingness to join me today to ensure this intent is clearly  stated in the Congressional Record.  Given the agreement to provide formal clarification of the  expectation that DOJ and FTC shall provide notification to States  regarding complaints or investigations they have received or are  performing, I will withdraw my objection to passage of this  legislation.  Thank you.    ", "Mrs. BLACKBURN": " Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I yield back all time.    ", "Mr. MURPHY": " Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, America has 600 billionaires. Now, $1  billion doesn't sound like a lot of money these days. President Trump  just signed a bill, begrudgingly, that has $900 billion in it. But  trust me--$1 billion is still a whole lot of money. It is actually so  much money that it is really hard to find words to describe what it  looks like, but let me try.  If you are, for instance, one of the half a million Americans who  make the minimum wage in this Nation and are lucky enough to work 40  hours a week, guess how many years you would have to work in order to  get $1 billion. Five hundred years? A thousand years? Ten thousand  years? No, you are not even close. If you make minimum wage in America  today, you would need to work for 75,000 years in order to make $1  billion--75,000 years. Neanderthals were roaming the Earth 75,000 years  ago. Those guys, if they had made minimum wage, would have had to have  worked up until present day, every single day--that is, of course, if  they hadn't spent a dime of the money they had made in order to accrue  $1 billion.  One billion dollars is a bananas amount of money, and there are 600  people in America today who make at least that amount of money or have  that amount of money to their names. That is crazy. With $1 billion,  you are leading a life that, frankly, none of us can really imagine,  right? You have private planes. You have yachts. You have household  staffs in the dozens. You have enough money to make sure that your  children and your grandchildren and your great-grandchildren and your  great-great-grandchildren never have to work a day in their lives.  Generations of your offspring can just live lives of indolent luxury,  without a care, if they so choose.  Do you know where I was 2 days before Thanksgiving this year? I was  at Hamden Middle School, in my State, to help hand out free food for  the unemployed, the poor, and the disabled ahead of a long holiday  weekend. Those long weekends can be really hard, especially the ones  that fall at the end of the month when the SNAP benefits have long run  out. I got there as darkness fell but right at the beginning of the  event. I noticed that down the hill from the roundabout at the school  at which they were handing out the food, there was usually an empty  parking lot. That night, at that moment, at the beginning of the event,  that parking lot was lit up by hundreds of sets of headlights of  hundreds of cars that were just sitting there, idle, in that parking  lot.  I asked the organizer of the event what was going on in that parking  lot. Was there some other event happening that evening? Why all the  cars?  He told me: The cars started pulling into that lot hours ago. They  got wind we were handing out food, and they got here early to make sure  they didn't get left out. We have enough food for 300 people, and there  were 300 cars in that lot before I even got here.  That is what has happened during this pandemic. Millions of families  all across this Nation, through no fault of their own, have lost their  jobs or have had their hours dramatically cut back. They have no  savings because work doesn't pay in this country anymore. They spend  everything they earn each month.  So when the economy collapsed, virtually overnight in the spring,  they got desperate--really fast.  I want you to think about what it is really like on an hour-to-hour  basis when you don't have enough money for food for your family. The  decisions you have to make every single day are practically  animalistic. Do you make your kids go hungry during the day, when they  need the most energy, or do you skimp on dinner and force your kids to  go to bed with hunger pangs?  There are hundreds of thousands of mothers and fathers who, right  now, as I am speaking, are making that decision today. That is the  reality of this pandemic.  But here is another reality: Those 600 billionaires in this country?  As it turns out, as a group, they lost nothing--nothing--during this  pandemic. No, exactly the opposite. They got richer.  The wealthiest 600 Americans collectively added $1 trillion to their  bank accounts. Let me say it again. The richest 600 Americans gained $1  trillion over the course of 2020.  Let's be clear. That is not money that grew in their money tree  orchards. Yes, we are printing some more money these days, but wealth  isn't far away from a zero-sum game still. So when we allow for 600  people in the country to control 50 percent of the Nation's wealth,  that is coming out of your pocket.  Six hundred people in a country of 328 million isn't a lot of people.  But do you know what is a smaller number than 600? Fifty-two.  There are 52 Republicans in this Chamber--52 people who are going to  have a decision to make about what to do in a country where millions  are literally starving as we speak, while 600 billionaires count the $1  trillion in additional wealth that they have accumulated during this  period of national calamity.  The question before these 52 Senate Republicans is simple. It is  simple: Should we give $2,000 to low- and middle-income Americans right  now to help them survive this crisis? That is the decision Senate  Republicans have to make right now. Time is running out.  Six hundred billionaires got $1 trillion richer this year, and the  question [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7960\">Page S7960</a>, ] before Senate Republicans is this: Are you willing to spend an amount  equal to just half of that windfall to America's billionaires in order  to help 160 million Americans?  Right now, the 52 Senate Republicans serving in this Chamber are the  only thing standing in the way of $2,000 being sent to 160 million of  our neediest citizens.  The House passed the bill authorizing the checks in a big, bipartisan  vote. It is hard to get two-thirds of the House of Representatives to  agree on what time it is, but two-thirds of the House of  Representatives voted for the $2,000 checks. President Trump supports  the $2,000 checks, so he will sign the bill if the Senate sends it to  him. We can vote on the House bill today in a matter of hours if Senate  Republicans agree.  So why isn't this happening? Why didn't Senator McConnell announce  the schedule for the vote on the $2,000 checks bill? Why didn't he  agree to Senator Schumer's request to bring it up for an immediate  vote?  Now, a lot of Republicans are saying they object to the payments  because they cost too much and they are going to add too much to the  deficit. Well, frankly, spare me the fake righteous indignation about  the deficit all of a sudden.  Three years ago, these same deficit hawk Republicans passed a tax cut  bill that, before the pandemic hit, had already added over $200 billion  to the annual deficit, and that was a tax cut where 80 percent of the  benefits went to the richest 1 percent of Americans.  Warren Buffet wrote in his note to investors last year that the  deficit-financed tax cuts earned his empire $29 billion overnight. That  windfall, Buffet noted, ``did not come from anything we accomplished at  Berkshire.'' So it is funny: Deficits just didn't matter to the 52 when  it was tax cuts to the 600 richest people in America.  But even if this Congress weren't ending in 5 days and we had time to  figure out how to pay for it, do you know how we can't pay for it?  Cutting foreign aid.  President Trump has been talking a lot about foreign aid in the last  week. Now, the money we spend on foreign aid, all supported by  Democrats and Republicans over the years, all of it smart investments  in our Nation's security--that actually wasn't in the COVID relief  package. It was in the annual budget, as it always is. It just so  happens that this year the COVID relief package and the annual budget  were passed together.  But just for argument's sake, let's say Trump got his way and every  single dollar of foreign aid was cut out of the budget. Would that pay  for the $2,000 checks? Not even close. President Trump apparently has  an oversized impression of how much money we spend on foreign aid,  because our annual foreign aid spending doesn't even equal 10 percent  of the cost of a one-time $2,000 payment to low- and middle-income  citizens.  There is also some speculation that Senator McConnell is going to  join together the $2,000 payments with other, much more controversial  measures, much more complicated measures, like the reform of our  internet liability laws. That is an invitation for this entire effort  to fall apart.  The House has finished voting. They have passed the $2,000 payment  bill and sent it to us. They are not interested in taking up anything  else. If we start adding poison pills to the $2,000 payment bill, that  is just another way of telling the American people that this body  doesn't support $2,000 payments.  Listen, being a billionaire must be crazy. I make a lot of money as a  Senator, but even I would have to work 7,500 years before my earnings  equaled $1 billion. You know what was happening $7,500 years ago? The  Stone Age.  There isn't a good reason to oppose giving Americans who aren't  billionaires a measly $2,000 check to help them put food on the table  for their kids in the middle of this once-in-a-lifetime crisis.  There isn't a good reason to choose to make moms and dads all across  this country decide which two meals they will feed their kids each day  because three meals are not an option. Two thousand dollars doesn't put  dinner on the table every night, but, man, going to bed hungry when you  are 11--it sucks. And even dealing with it every other night instead of  every single night, no kid is going to turn that down.  There are 52 of you, and in the next 24 to 48 hours, you get to  decide: Do you protect the billionaires or do you choose to feed that  11-year-old kid? The only thing that stands between the American people  and a $2,000 emergency survival check is 52 Senate Republicans. Got it?  Understand?  There is a bill pending right now before the Senate that gives $2,000  to ordinary Americans. Yes, it costs a lot of money, and maybe down the  line we will have to ask the billionaires to pay for it, but the bill  is here right now. The legislative session expires in 5 days. President  Trump says he will sign it, and all that matters right now is what  these 52 people decide.  The House passed the bill with lots of Democratic and Republican  support. The President supports the idea. The only thing that can stop  $2,000 payments to struggling Americans right now is 52 Senate  Republicans.  Some things in Washington aren't that simple--but this is.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    ", "Mr. BLUNT": " Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, pursuant to Senate rule XXXIII, I wish to  inform all Senators that on December 18, 2020, the Committee on Rules  and Administration adopted the ``U.S. Senate Alternate Vehicle Parking  Regulations,'' which supersede and replace the current ``Regulations  Governing Use of Bicycle Racks Hart Office Building Garage.''  The updated regulations describe the eligibility and process Senators  and eligible staff use to request, register, and obtain parking permits  for alternate vehicles.

", "Mr. MENENDEZ": " Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise with grave concern to speak about  the troubling political situation in Uganda in the runup to that  country's elections on January 14 and to call on President Museveni to  take immediate action to stop the country's downward political spiral.  Uganda has been an important if not critical security and  counterterrorism partner to the United States for well over a decade,  playing a prominent role in the African Union's Mission to Somalia and  hosting over 1.4 million refugees. Its leadership and influence in East  Africa and the African continent writ large is difficult to overstate.  However, these are troubling times in Uganda, and longstanding efforts  to advance its democracy are now in peril.  National elections in Uganda have not met internationally accepted  standards for free and fair polls since 1996, when they were held for  the first time after a long-running conflict that brought President  Museveni to power. For decades, Museveni's ruling National Resistance  Party, NRM, has leveraged access to and influence over [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7992\">Page S7992</a>, ] state resources and institutions to tilt the electoral balance in its  favor. These efforts are not new. Under President Museveni's  leadership, the NRM successfully moved to change the Ugandan  Constitution in 2005 to remove Presidential term limits and again in  and 2017 to lift age limits. These changes allow President Museveni,  who has been in power since 1986, to remain in office indefinitely. Not  only have Museveni and the NRM engineered a constitutional coup, they  have undertaken a campaign of political repression that has only become  worse since the last general elections. Ugandan authorities have  increasingly used coercive measures, including arbitrary arrests and  detentions, torture, extrajudicial killings, and intrusive surveillance  technology to intimidate and silence critics, place a strangle hold on  media, and stifle political opposition in the country.  Leading opposition figures have been targeted in brazen and shocking  ways. Members of Parliament have been arrested and detained on numerous  occasions, and there is strong evidence to support their claims of  being tortured by President Museveni's security forces while in  custody. Last week, prominent human rights attorney Nicholas Opiyo,  along with several other attorneys, was arrested in what appears to be  a blatant act of intimidation for their investigation into killings  that occurred as a result of the arrest of rival Presidential candidate  Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu in November. Just this past weekend, one of  Kyagulanyi's bodyguards was killed by security forces in a violent  confrontation that also saw two journalists injured. Imagine that  happening to any political candidate here in the United States to one  of our colleagues as they were out on the campaign trail this fall. We  should all be outraged by such acts.  To date there have been no meaningful investigations into these  incidents and no accountability for these abuses. The question we must  ask ourselves is, Why? Why has President Museveni failed to take swift  and decisive action to ensure the safety and security of members of the  Ugandan Parliament and other opposition figures, and bring those  responsible to justice? Is President Museveni protecting particular  individuals? Or perhaps direct responsibility for the violence against  the Uganda opposition lies even further up the chain of command?  Journalists and nongovernmental organizations have been under  pressure as well. Ugandan authorities continue to use a range of  restrictive and onerous administrative measures against NGOs, including  deregistration of more than 12,000 mostly local NGOs in November 2019.  Earlier this month, Ugandan authorities froze the bank accounts of some  NGOs, and in the past, the Museveni administration has denied entry and  deported some leaders of international NGOs in what were clear acts of  intimidation. Journalists working for foreign media outlets are now  required to reregister with Ugandan authorities or risk criminal  penalties, and some foreign journalists have also been deported from  the country.  Government has also attacked digital rights and academic freedoms.  Individuals with large social media followings are subject to onerous  administrative regulation. Burdensome taxes have been imposed on social  media users, and some individuals who have criticized the Museveni  administration on social media platforms have even been prosecuted.  Ugandan authorities have taken repeated action to suppress academic  freedom and intimidate students and faculty who have been critical of  the Museveni administration, including by firing and jailing professors  who criticize the regime.  In short, the longstanding effort to build democracy in Uganda is  under grave threat, and we must take action in support of those  defending political freedoms in the country. That is why I introduced  \", S. Res 807, '. It not only condemns the actions of the Museveni  administration, it calls on the Secretary of State and the heads of  relevant departments and agencies of the U.S. Government to undertake  three essential actions: first, to consider the imposition of targeted  sanctions and visa restrictions on actors involved in undermining  credible, transparent elections, and those who have perpetrated or  abetted human rights abuses; second, to work with African partners,  like-minded countries, and international institutions and organizations  to develop and implement strategies and actions to promote and defend  human, civil, and political rights and multiparty democracy in Uganda;  and third, to immediately conduct a review of U.S. assistance and  cooperation with Uganda for the purposes of reprioritizing such  assistance should neutral observers determine that the January 2021  polls do not meet internationally accepted standards for credible  elections.  If the outcome of the elections in Uganda does not reflect the will  of the people, I will be calling for the Biden administration to  reevaluate our relationship with the Museveni administration, and I  plan to pursue binding legislation in the 117th Congress that builds on  ', S Res 807, \". Uganda's stature and importance as a security partner should  not prevent the United States from speaking out in support of democracy  and taking action in support of those Ugandans fighting for democratic  freedoms.    ", "Mr. BARRASSO": " Mr. BARRASSO. I thank Senator Carper. I appreciate it.  You know, it is interesting: Senator Alexander recently gave his  speech, his farewell address, and he said that sometimes politics is  like a split-screen television set. On the one half, you see all the  fighting and contention and the dysfunctional side. And on the other  side of the screen, you see the functioning side. But not many people  look at that functioning side.  What we have been able to do as a partnership on the Environment and  Public Works Committee was functional--in a bipartisan way, coming up  with solutions. As you mentioned, there were over 70 cosponsors on the  one piece of legislation. All of them, I think, got through the  committee unanimously. That is something that made no news because  there wasn't a fight. There was cooperation for the betterment--to make  sure we protected the economy and, at the same time, preserved the  environment. That is what we need do: Continue to make sure that we can  protect both and continue with economic development as well as  environmental stewardship for our Nation.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    ", "Mr. MARKEY": " Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I rise to echo the sentiments of the  Senator from Vermont. He is right. The Republicans are wrong on this  issue. On every single part of this debate, Senator Sanders is right;  the Republicans are wrong.  We are in the middle of an unprecedented crisis in our country. We  have a healthcare crisis, we have an unemployment crisis, we have a  hunger crisis, we have a housing crisis, we have an addiction crisis,  and we have a moral crisis in this country.  The U.S. Government should be responding to the needs, to the  desperation of families in our country at this time. There is a crisis  of faith that the American people have in its government's ability to  respond to human suffering. Well, this institution has been created to  respond to human suffering. That is our job  Tony Fauci has made it very clear that the worst of the pandemic is  ahead of us, not behind us. We know what is coming, and yet we are not  responding. We know this is not going away soon, and yet we are not  responding.  A program, Operation Warp Speed, was created to create a vaccine, but  because for 7 months the Republicans have refused to fund the public  health [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7975\">Page S7975</a>, ] system of our country at the State and local level, we have ``Operation  Snail Speed'' to put the vaccinations in the arms of the American  people.  It was anticipatable. Tony Fauci and others were warning us back in  May and June and July that there would be a second wave and the second  wave could be bigger. We got the warning. The Republicans refused to  heed that warning.  And here we are now, without the public health infrastructure to deal  with the overflow capacity in emergency rooms, in ICUs all across the  country, while simultaneously asking those same medical institutions to  put vaccinations in the arms of healthy people, without the resources  provided by the Federal Government to help those States and local  communities to deal with that crisis.  Sometimes Daniel Patrick Moynihan would say that when you deal with  an issue you deal with it with benign neglect if you don't want to help  or you don't want to hurt--deal with benign neglect.  What has happened with the Republicans this year is that they created  a program which is designed neglect. It is an actual plan not to  provide the funding, not to provide the help for those families, for  those communities, for those institutions that are now being  overwhelmed, and asked, on top of that, to put this extra burden of  putting vaccinations in people's arms, but without the extra resources.  And what do they do on the Republican side? They throw out these red  herrings--so many red herrings that you would need to build an aquarium  in the well here of the Senate in order to deal with all of them--that  gets away from the central issue: Yes or no, up or down, will you  provide $2,000 to Americans who are going to need it through what Tony  Fauci is saying will be the worst part of this pandemic? Yes or no, up  or down, where do they stand on this issue?  Here is what we do know. Republicans seem more focused on funding the  Defense Department than they do on funding the defenseless in our  country, and Americans are becoming more defenseless as each day goes  by. The headlines are screaming that this panic, which is absolutely  understandable and based upon fact, is sweeping our country.  There is protection that the Federal Government should be providing  to these families. We hear it. They are hungry. They could be without  their homes. The addiction crisis is rising. They need help in their  families.  So from my perspective, we have a moment in time, and Donald Trump  happens to agree with us--even though a broken clock is right twice a  day. And we do agree with him. He is right. We do need this help, which  we should be providing to these families.  As we watch more and more of our American loved ones fall sick and  die, families are facing a new and unprecedented hardship. They are  having to make impossible decisions as to whether to put food on the  table or keep the heat on through the cold winter months, and the U.S.  Government has an obligation to help working people who, through no  fault of their own, are seeing all of the things that they care about,  all of the success that they have worked for, and all the financial  security they have earned be washed away.  And yet the Republicans want to put another ``Operation Snail Speed''  in place.  The damage to these families is anticipatable. We can see what is  unfolding. Dr. Fauci is telling us that we are at the worst part of the  pandemic and it is going to continue. So let us act in anticipation.  Louis Pasteur used to say that ``chance favors the prepared mind.''  That is what Dr. Tony Fauci is telling us. Let us prepare. Let us help  families prepare for what is about to arrive.  Just in Massachusetts alone, 21,000 new people applied for  unemployment insurance in the week before Christmas. Food banks across  Massachusetts and across the country are seeing double-digit increases  in demand with families who never faced food insecurity before. People  are literally starving, cold, and without homes.  Meanwhile, the majority leader and Republican leadership would rather  head home for the New Year and ignore the financial and health crises  that are taking a toll on our families. For millions of Americans, this  will be a New Year holiday where they won't know if they can put food  on the table that night. Republicans are claiming that giving $2,000 in  direct cash payments to working Americans would be too expensive, that  it would inflate our national deficit, that our budgets are already  bloated.  I have to ask, though, where was this outrage when Republicans blew  up our national deficit to give a $1.5 trillion tax cut to billionaires  and corporations? These are the crocodile tears from the right, as  Americans are shedding real tears thinking about where their next meal  will come from, the eviction notice on the front door, or losing  healthcare in the midst of this crisis.  Americans are actually tired of being told that $600 is  ``sufficient'' as an amount of money as relief, as billionaires receive  their tax breaks and grow their wealth by the trillions of dollars  during this crisis. The rich get richer, and the rest are there left  suffering. They have had enough of being told that there just isn't the  money for support for the well-being of their communities when they can  see tax breaks going to those companies that are actually laying off  workers.  Americans are tired of being let down by their government time and  time again, as Donald Trump and his Republican allies have abandoned  them during this response to the pandemic.  Americans need support. They need to be able to trust their  government, and they need $2,000 now. So that is the issue: Yes or no,  up or down, on providing $2,000 to Americans to help them make it  through the worst part of this crisis.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12:30 p.m. on  Thursday, December 31, the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of \", H.R. 9051, ', a bill to provide a $2,000 direct payment  to the working class; that the bill be considered read a third time and  the Senate vote on passage of that bill without intervening action or  debate; further, that if passed, the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table; and that immediately following the vote  on ', H.R. 9051, ', the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of the  veto message on ', H.R. 6395, \"; that the Senate immediately vote on passage  of the bill, the objections of the President to the contrary  notwithstanding, with no intervening action or debate.    ", "Mr. INHOFE": " Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    ", "Mr. BOOZMAN": " Mr. BOOZMAN. The Chair, on behalf of the President pro tempore, upon  the recommendation of the Majority Leader, pursuant to Public Law 116- 113, and in consultation with the Chairman of the Senate Committee on  Finance, appoints the following individuals to the Independent Mexico  Labor Expert Board: Kyle Fortson of the District of Columbia and  Charlotte Ponticelli of Maryland.    ", "Mr. WHITEHOUSE": " Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, while Senator Grassley is on the  floor, I would thank him for his remarks about the First Step Act and  let him know that on the Judiciary Committee, I look forward to working  with him to continue to advance that.  As the Senate knows, the Grassley-Durbin segment and the Cornyn- Whitehouse segment were the two key pieces of that bill, and it is  terrific to hear the Senator and our chairman at the time chose support  to continue that work. So I am grateful.  What I would like to do now is to follow the conversation we had  about oceans a minute ago in the context of my ``Time to Wake Up''  speeches.  Obviously, the oceans are taking a colossal beating from climate  change, from the warming, from the chemical acidification that it  causes. It is warming at a rate of multiple detonations of Hiroshima- level nuclear weapons per second in the ocean. That is the amount of  heat that is added, if you want to put an image to it.  So we have done some good things on oceans in this Congress, and I  would like to summarize some of those.  One, obviously, is Save Our Seas 2.0 that Senator Sullivan, Senator  Menendez, and I just discussed, but we also have a little package of  enforcement provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act that  focus on what is commonly called illegal, unreported, and unregulated  fishing--IUU fishing--which is a really boring and bureaucratic name  for extremely bad behavior.  Essentially, it is modern slavery at sea for the crew, who are  miserably trapped on these illegal, pirate fishing vessels. They are  also an avenue for trafficking of humans, of narcotics, of arms, or  whatever. Once you are out in a boat outside, beyond the realm of the  law, operating illegally and doing whatever you can for money, you will  do pretty much anything there is. So in addition to ransacking our  common seas, these pirate fishing fleets are really dangerous vectors  for really dangerous criminal conduct.  I am glad that we have put a little more heat on the Navy to up its  game and report on its implementation of previously passed measures. I  am glad that we have directed the Navy to work with the Coast Guard,  which has the substantive jurisdiction over all of this, and to work  with the private sector involved in solutions to this. There are such  things as private sector satellites that track the wake and the signal  of these illegal fishing vessels, and coordinating that with our  intelligence and our research I think will really help in fighting that  battle, so that we are sharing the information that we can and  gathering the information that we can to be more effective.  Finally, as I recall from my travels with the late Senator McCain,  when you went to coastal countries near China, you always heard the  same complaint. We went to the Philippines and heard it. We went to  Vietnam and heard it. We went to Indonesia and heard it. There are  probably others if I could remember more clearly that I could add to  that list. But the complaint was that the Chinese fishing fleet is  incredibly aggressive, it is trespassing into foreign sovereign waters,  it is fishing illegally and outside of any respect for the domestic  protections of these nations, and it is often violently protected by  Chinese vessels, by navy or other vessels of the Chinese Government. So  focusing on that as a place to push back and protect our oceans while  at the same time diminishing this bad behavior by China is also a good  thing.  So that was our suite of progress on pirate fishing in the NDAA.  In the omnibus, we expect at least $75 million to go, for the first  time, into a new fund to tackle ocean plastics and for ocean plastic  work in the administration.  So those are bits of good news, and I am delighted that those things  have happened. The less good news from this past year is that coasts  remain sadly underfunded, and we have missed some real opportunities.  Two of the accounts that demonstrate how badly funded coasts are  facing these threats from the changing oceans are the Land and Water  Conservation Fund, which should properly be called the inland and  freshwater conservation fund, and the Army Corps Flood and Coastal  Storm Damage Reduction Fund.  If you go back and look at how this money actually gets spent, for  every dollar that the Land and Water Conservation Fund spends in an  inland State, in a landlocked State, per capita, it spends only 40  cents in a coastal State--a dollar per capita inland, 40 cents per  capita coastal. And that actually understates the coastal discrepancy  because it doesn't count the spending in coastal States that isn't on  coasts. You have coastal States like New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas  that have big, big upland inland areas in which most of the Land and  Water Conservation Fund money goes.  So what we really ought to do is call this what it is, which is an  inland and freshwater conservation fund, and have a parallel coastal  and saltwater preservation fund to make sure that coasts are treated  fairly.  I did not even get the chance to ask for some adjustments to treat  coasts more fairly as an amendment when we reconsidered the Land and  Water Conservation in the so-called Great American Outdoors Act, which  was frustrating because everybody--at least on my side of the aisle-- talks a good game about how we need to have more amendments, we need to  have more amendments. That deal got locked down before it got to the  Senate floor. Nobody was allowed an amendment. So that was frustrating,  but we will fight on because coasts need to be treated fairly, and with  sea level rise and warming and fisheries moving about and storm surge  worsening and more hurricanes, the dangers to coasts are greater than  before, not less.  On the Army Corps account, that is even more extreme. If you go back  through the last 10 years, the best year the coasts had in the flood  and coastal storm damage account was 1 coastal dollar for every 19  inland dollars--1 coastal dollar for every 19 inland dollars. Tell me  how that is fair to coasts facing those same risks. And that is the  best year. The worst year was 120 times more for inland projects than  for coastal projects--less than a penny on the dollar. Less than a  penny on the dollar for America's coasts.  So we have a lot of work to do to make sure that we are doing what we  need to do for our coasts. I am hoping that we can move the OFFSHORE  Act--that there is even a faint chance of getting it done in the last  few days. It had a successful hearing in Energy and Natural Resources.  It has 19 bipartisan cosponsors, including Commerce Chairman Wicker,  and it would treat wind energy offshore the same way for revenues that  we treat oil drilling offshore--i.e., 37.5 percent to the nearby State,  12.5 percent to a dedicated fund. In this case, it would be the Oceans  and Coastal Fund because it is oceans and coastal. It is one of the  ironies that most of the money that comes off of coastal oil drilling-- offshore oil drilling--gets moved into the Land and Water Conservation  Fund, where it goes out West and is spent on inland, not coastal,  projects.  So we continue to have real work to do. There is the BLUE GLOBE Act,  which I have with Senator Murkowski, on data monitoring in the oceans  and Great Lakes--we are going to continue to push forward--and our Blue  Carbon bill, which will help us address the changes in the oceans that  climate change is wreaking. With Blue Carbon, things like growing  mangroves are incredibly powerful as a carbon sink, kelp and sea  grass--to get that research done and do the work we need to to  deacidify our oceans while we still have reefs that are alive.  My ideal would be a ``big blue bill''--a big blue bill that combines  BLUE GLOBE, Blue Carbon, and others and, [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7491\">Page S7491</a>, ] for once, finally, finally, finally, finally, finally takes our oceans  and coasts seriously.  I get that we are terrestrial mammals, but a lot of us care for our  coasts, a lot of us care for our seas, a lot of our economies are  dependent on our oceans, and the health of the planet is dependent on  the cooling and on the oxygen that oceans provide. So we mess around  with our oceans at our peril.  I hope that the Biden administration will take climate change as  deadly serious as it needs to be taken and that it will step up a  significant step from the degree of attention climate change got in the  Obama administration.  We have to recognize the danger to our future if we remain  negligent--it is that simple. And we have to make sure we free  ourselves from the thrall of the fossil fuel industry's climate denial  machine because the fossil fuel industry does not want what is best for  America, does not want what is best for people, does not want what is  best for oceans and the environment; it wants what is best for its  profits, period, and end of story.  So we really, really, really, under the Biden administration, need a  serious climate bill to safeguard the oceans on the only planet that we  call home.  I yield the floor.

Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, let me  start by pointing out that we are not in the same place that we were  back in March. Our economy is in nothing like the situation we faced  during a moment in March when this body came together and voted  unanimously, I believe, for the most extraordinary aid package-- financial stimulus bill, however you care to characterize it--in the  history of the world by far. Remember where we were. We had closed down  the economy. To a very large degree, the American economy had stopped  functioning because State governments around the country decided they  had to close it down. We can discuss and we can argue about whether  that was a good decision or not, but given the limited knowledge we had  about the nature of the COVID-19 threat, it was deemed to be the right  thing to do.  So we were on the verge of having no economy. That has never happened  before in our history.  So what did we do? We decided this calls for extraordinary measures,  and we would try to use Federal dollars as a substitute for the  economy--just replace lost income on a massive, unprecedented scale-- and we did. We approved almost $3 trillion in that legislation.  At the time, we included $1,200 per person. You could make an  argument that that was an extremely inefficient use of that $1,200 per  person, but at the time, given the circumstances, I understood why we  didn't have many good options, and that was something we decided to do.  So where are we now? We are in a very different place. Our economy is  not in a free fall. Our economy is in a recovery mode. We are not back  to where we want to end up. We are not back to where we were before  March, but we have taken big steps in that direction.  The economy grew at 33 percent last quarter--33 percent. That is a  tremendous recovery that is underway. More than half of all the people  who lost their jobs earlier this year have regained their jobs. So we  are not finished yet, but that is a huge step along the way.  And now we are being told, after passing another extraordinary bill-- this one almost $1 trillion and including $600 per person--that that is  not enough; we need to do $2,000 per person, despite the fact that we  know for sure, we know for a fact, that the large majority of those  checks are going to go to people who had no lost income.  How does that make any sense at all? We know for sure that the  majority of these people had no lost income. They didn't lose their  jobs, and yet we are going to send them not $600, not the $1,200, but  $2,000.  So think about this. A married couple, who both are working and have  2 kids, maybe they work for the Federal Government, like 2 million-odd  people do. Maybe they work for a large company, the vast majority of  which did not have large numbers of layoffs. So this two-child, two- income couple that makes six figures had no interruption, no  diminishment of their income whatsoever. They are going to get $8,000  of money we don't have that is going to be either borrowed or printed.  That is what it is all going to come down to.  There are people who are still suffering from the economic fallout of  this terrible COVID crisis. There is no question about it. We know  there are people who are concentrated in a handful of industries, for  the most part--not exclusively--but people who have worked in the  restaurant industry, people who work for hotels, travel, entertainment.  So many of those people are still out of work and their prospects of  getting their old jobs back are not good in the short run. I sure hope  they will be good in the medium-term run, if not sooner.  And our bill addressed that. It addressed that problem. How did we do  that? With a new round of PPP loans, which are really grants to small  businesses, if they will keep their workforce intact; expansion of  unemployment insurance benefits, so that people who have historically  been ineligible remain eligible so they can continue to collect  unemployment benefits; an increase in the amount of unemployment  benefits, a $300-a-week overlay of Federal money on top of whatever  their State program is; $600 per person, regardless of whether they  lost income.  All of that was passed just a few days ago, and now we are told we  need to come back immediately, right now, and make sure that we are  sending $2,000 checks to people who had no lost income.  So for that reason, I object.    ", "Ms. DUCKWORTH": " Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my dear  friend and colleague, Deirdre ``Dee'' Wallace, who retired this year  after 36 years of Federal service. A true civil servant, Dee served our  country and its citizens with humility and empathy for decades.  Since taking the vow to serve and protect our Nation as a soldier in  the U.S. Army, Dee has never stopped fighting for the American people.  After 5 years of military service, Dee dedicated her life to making  government work for the people during decades of service with the Army  National Guard and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.  Never discouraged, Dee embodies the type of caring spirit and can-do  attitude that we should all strive to emulate. As my chief of staff at  the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Dee worked tirelessly to bring  awareness to servicemembers battling posttraumatic stress disorder and  veterans facing homelessness.  In our time together, I learned that no stone will go unturned with  Dee around. She will always find a way to care for America's heroes.  Her service to her community is remarkable and her story inspiring. I  stand here today to applaud my dear friend and to honor her  extraordinary work.  Dee, I wish you the best of luck in retirement and thank you for your  service.    ", "Mrs. FISCHER": " Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, next Thursday is Thanksgiving, and we  are here today because, even during a tough year like this one, we have  so many things to be thankful for.  In that spirit, I would like to tell a short story about a Nebraskan  whose contribution to the history of our country is pretty  extraordinary.  In 1886, Andrew Jackson Higgins was born in the small town of  Columbus, NE. He spent most of his childhood in Omaha, and he served in  the Nebraska Army National Guard after the turn of the 20th century  before moving to Alabama at the age of 20 to work in the lumber  industry.  He worked a wide variety of jobs, hoping to learn enough to  eventually start his own business. He succeeded in his dream in 1922  when he founded Higgins Lumber and Export Company, which quickly grew  to become one of the largest lumber companies in North America.  Four years later, his company designed the Eureka boat, a 36-foot- long boat that was able to sail in just a few feet of water. At the  time, lumber could only be loaded onto ships at port, but a craft that  could operate in such shallow water could run on and off of riverbanks,  enabling Higgins Lumber and Export Company to load and unload its  lumber just about anywhere.  In short, Andrew Higgins built the Eureka boat simply to make his  employees' lives easier, and that was an honorable goal. But throughout  the next decade, as it became clear that Hitler decided to plunge the  world back into war, the U.S. military began to search for a way to  land soldiers directly onto beaches. They turned to the Eureka boat,  which beat the Navy's design in a head-to-head test in 1939.  There was just one problem: The only way to get on or off the boat  was by jumping over the sides, and this would leave soldiers exposed to  enemy fire in combat. To get around this, the Navy asked Higgins to add  a ramp door to the boat's bow. He returned with the final design just a  month later, and the Higgins boat was born.  Andrew Higgins' company went on to produce over 23,000 of these  boats, and his design worked so well that the Allies trusted them to  carry our soldiers across the English Channel on D-Day. Without the  Higgins boat, we may not have turned the tide of World War II at  Normandy. We may never have liberated Europe from Hitler's grasp.  In fact, President Dwight Eisenhower, who was the Supreme Allied  Commander in Europe on D-Day, went as far as to say that Andrew Higgins  was ``the man who won the war for us.''  It was an honor to attend the 75th anniversary of D-Day last year at  Omaha Beach, to see firsthand the beach where the ``greatest  generation'' jumped out of those boats that Andrew Higgins built to  save the world from Naziism.  I am thankful for them, and I am thankful for the sacrifices that all  of our veterans and Active-Duty servicemembers make each and every day.  We all know that Thanksgiving is going to be a little different this  year. As important as it is to spend time with our extended family,  many of whom we only see once a year, it is just as important to do  what we can to protect those we love from this virus.  I won't pretend that it is easy to spend Thanksgiving apart from  these large gatherings of loved ones, but I hope the far greater  sacrifices our soldiers and veterans have made will help us to keep  this hardship in perspective.  This Thanksgiving, let's give thanks for our military; let's give  thanks for Andrew Higgins and the Higgins boat, which saved the lives  of so many of our soldiers on D-Day; and let's give thanks for our  veterans and those currently serving this country in the Armed Forces.  Without the sacrifices that they have made and continue to make every  day, our country wouldn't be as great as it is today. Their service  makes Thanksgiving possible, this year and every year.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    ", "Mr. UDALL": " Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  members of my staff--Ned Adriance, Lauren Arias, Clinton Cowan, Renee  Gasper, Cara Gilbert, Annie Orloff, Leo Sheehan, and Lisa Van  Theemsche--be given floor privileges for the remainder of the 116th  Congress.    ", "Mr. PORTMAN": " Mr. PORTMAN. First of all, I want to agree with my colleague from  Michigan and thank her for her work concerning behavioral health and  working with us in a bipartisan group on both behavioral health and  addiction because, unfortunately, during this pandemic, the epidemic of  drug addiction and drug overdose and overdose deaths has increased  dramatically, and it is a heartbreaking reality because we were making  progress, thanks to work here in this Chamber and in the States. Around  the country, we were actually reducing not just the number of people  addicted but the number of people who were suffering from overdose and  overdose deaths.  Unfortunately, this year we are now going to see the largest overdose  death rate in the history of our country, we believe. That is a sad  reality, and we need to address it--that is part of the COVID-19  package--along with the behavioral health issues that are also,  unfortunately, being exacerbated by the isolation that comes with the  COVID-19 issue and the helpless, probably, and the joblessness that we  have been seeing.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    ", "Mrs. MURRAY": " Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have learned in my time in the Senate  that if you want to get something done across the aisle, you really  need the following: You need someone on the other side who is just as  committed to working together as you are, and that Member needs to have  the trust of Members on your side of the aisle and on his own, and you  both need to be willing to set aside egos and listen and get a  realistic understanding of whether the person on the other side of the  negotiating table can reach an agreement with you that upholds your  principles without compromising his own.  Now, what I have laid out might not sound that unusual or rare, but  it is actually pretty tough to find these days. I have been very lucky  that the Senator whom we honor today on the floor--my colleague and  friend, Chairman Lamar Alexander, of Tennessee--is someone who has  managed it time and again.  I don't think anyone, least of all Senator Alexander himself, would  be surprised to hear me say that we are as likely to disagree as to  agree on many matters. I bring my Washington State values to the table,  and he brings his Tennessee values, so you can imagine how that has  gone from time to time. Yet, despite our different perspectives and our  different approaches we take to policymaking, we have also been able to  see where our values and the interests of our States and our country  converge.  We both understood that the broken No Child Left Behind law needed to  be fixed. Lamar listened to me, which I so appreciated, when I told him  we should write a bill together rather than to amend the Republican  bill that he had begun working on. With our HELP Committee members, we  were able to write and pass a new K-12 public education bill that fixed  the most broken parts of No Child Left Behind. It included Federal  guardrails so we could understand how all of our students perform. It  dedicated resources to improving the schools that needed it the most.  It also allowed for historic steps forward on early education.  We laid the groundwork together for new investments in lifesaving  biomedical innovation and research through the 21st Century Cures Act,  including the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot.  We worked together to pass landmark legislation to boost our response  to the opioid epidemic, to strengthen our public health preparedness  programs, and to permanently fund historically Black colleges and  universities and minority-serving institutions. We not only passed each  of these bills, but we did so time and again with huge majorities from  this Senate. Now, even still, Chairman Alexander and I, along with our  colleagues in the House, are working to get legislation across the  finish line to finally ban surprise medical bills.  What I have just laid out is by no means a full list at all of  Senator Alexander's accomplishments as chairman. It doesn't even  include quite a few things he is still trying to get done as we speak.  Senator Alexander's focus on working together has helped countless  families in his home State of Tennessee, in my home State of  Washington, and nationwide.  My Democratic colleagues and I thank Chairman Alexander for the tone  and manner with which he has led the HELP Committee over the past 6  years--some of them, admittedly, rockier than others but, throughout,  guided by his steady leadership and commitment to working together.  For myself, as someone who shares the drive to not only fight for  what you believe in but also to look for common ground, I thank my  colleague from Tennessee for the many opportunities to dig in and get  to work that he has provided, for being willing to hear me and my  colleagues out again and again when necessary, and for looking so often  for common ground, for another problem we could solve, and for being  willing not just to keep talking but to keep listening as well.  Finally, I know none of this would have been possible without the  support and strength Senator Alexander has received from Honey, his  wife, and I acknowledge and thank her for her contribution as well.  Lamar, you will be thrilled to be back full time in the State you  love so much--I know that--but I and members of the HELP Committee want  you to know we are going to miss you terribly here in the Senate. Thank  you so much for all you have done. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7153\">Page S7153</a>, ]    ", "Mr. COTTON": " Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Toomey and thank  him for his expertise, for his foresight, and for his courage on the  issue of ending these CARES Act-funded Federal Reserve programs.  You have probably seen that over the last few days, he has been  subjected to an onslaught of vicious, dishonest attacks by Democrats  and their stenographers in the Press Gallery, saying that he was  somehow gumming up the works, that we were not going to pass this bill  because the Toomey language was stopping it. Nothing could be further  from the truth.  First off, while Senator Toomey may be our thought leader on this  issue, this was the Senate Republican conference's position. That is  why our majority leader stood firm behind it.  Second, as Senator Toomey said, this is not a new issue; this is not  something we just started debating. We had versions of this in our bill  this summer. As he laid out, the minority leader and the Speaker of the  House had a version of it in their $3.4 trillion this summer as well.  The minority leader sent a letter about it. This has been at the heart  of this legislation's debate for months. And the fact that it was in  their legislation, it was in their letter--they kept saying that we  wanted to somehow sabotage the economic recovery--just goes to show you  what their intents were with these programs. It was to use them, as  Senator Toomey said, as political slush funds; use them to bail out--I  don't know--New York State or the city of New York; use them to impose  politically correct policies on companies that could come to the Fed  and get low- or no-interest-rate loans if they danced to the woke  left's tune.  Senator Toomey and Senate Republicans drew the line on this. We drew  the line on politicizing the Fed. We had no intent whatsoever to harm  the Fed's background ability to take emergency action, and we will be  prepared in the future, as Congresses in the past have been, in an  economic crisis to act as well, just like we have twice in the last 12  years--2008 and 2020.  But nothing you have read in the news about Senator Toomey and his  language that he carried on behalf of the Senate Republican conference  could be further from the truth. I want to thank him for standing  strong, and I want to thank the majority leader for standing strong on  this as well.  I yield the floor.    ", "Ms. SMITH": " Ms. SMITH. Thank you for the clarification and for your work in  drafting the unemployment compensation language in this bill.    ", "Mr. LANKFORD": " Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I will be brief. I did what many of us  did today. We spent the day digging through a 5,600-page bill, trying  to find out what is in it. We broke it up into hundreds of pages of  chunks and separated it among our staff and just started reading  through it as quickly as we could, trying to be able to pull out the  details.  We found a lot of things that we really like. We found a few  surprises as well. So help us, we found, right in the middle of the  document on tax policy, a zombie--the wind production tax credit.  Something that we had heard had died--in fact, something that we had  heard died 2 years ago; in fact, something that we had heard died 6  years ago when all of us agreed it should die. In fact, the plan was to  take it down a little bit each and every year until it finally got to  zero. The problem was, when it got to zero, some lobbyist helped  somebody get it back in last year, and it suddenly, after going to  zero, reappeared. And then, so help me, it reappeared again.  So this temporary credit that distorts the market, that literally  changes the prices in all of our energy--whether that be oil or gas or  coal or solar or hydroelectric or nuclear--gives a special perk to one,  and all of the rest of them get furious. But for whatever reason, this  simple credit can't seem to go away.  When we agree to something, we should probably stick to it, and we  agreed years ago to phase this out. But yet this zombie keeps  reappearing and walking the halls of the Senate.  Our simple challenge is this. Let's put this zombie in the daylight.  Let's have the real argument over it and determine: Is this distorting  the energy market for everybody else, including all of our renewables?  Is it something we need to keep?  I live in Oklahoma, and if you know our song, you know ``the wind  comes sweeping down the plains.'' We have been called the Saudi Arabia  of wind power. I promise, you can't drive very far in Oklahoma without  seeing a field of windmills. We have lots of wind power, and we think  it is a great energy source. But it is a mature energy source, and it  does not need the wind production tax credit. So let's sunset it.  With that, I yield    ", "Ms. BALDWIN": " Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    ", "Mr. DAINES": " Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about my bipartisan  legislation, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act, which I  introduced with my colleague Senator Patrick Leahy. This is important  legislation that will protect consumers from anticompetitive practices  by repealing the outdated antitrust exemption for the health insurance  industry. This bill has wide bipartisan support, as well as a strong  history of near-unanimous congressional consensus, having passed the  House of Representatives three times, most recently this September.  In 1944, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. South-Eastern  Underwriters that the business of insurance was a form of interstate  commerce. This meant that the health insurance industry would be  subject to Federal antitrust laws under the Commerce Clause of the  Constitution. The insurance industry began raising uncertainties about  whether this meant that States would no longer have authority to  regulate insurance. When Congress acted to reaffirm this State  authority, in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, the insurance industry managed  to add a last-minute special-interest loophole that exempted the  business of insurance from Federal antitrust laws.  It has become clear that this antiquated exemption has effectively  given insurance companies the power to collude to drive up prices,  restrict competition, and deny consumers choice. The large health  insurance companies of today have taken advantage of this exemption to  abuse the market and artificially inflate healthcare costs. As a  result, consumers are paying higher prices to get basic healthcare  services, which couldn't be a worse outcome in the middle of a major  pandemic.  I recognize concerns have been raised about whether this legislation  might impair or create uncertainty regarding the authority of State  insurance regulators. I appreciate hearing from all stakeholders and  wish to put those concerns to rest by making clear the intent and scope  of the bill. This legislation merely amends a peripheral provision of  the McCarran-Ferguson Act containing an antiquated exemption from  Federal antitrust laws as it applies to health insurance companies. It  does not in any way interfere with, supersede, or abrogate the  authority provided and guaranteed by the McCarran-Ferguson Act to State  insurance regulators to regulate the health insurance industry.  This legislation would ensure that health insurance companies would  be subject to Federal antitrust laws in the same way as the rest of the  American economy, including other regulated sectors. Most importantly,  as this bill does not disturb any of the authority provided to State  insurance regulators under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, it does not  empower Federal authorities to interfere with, supersede, or prevent  states from regulating the health insurance industry however they see  fit.  Simply put, this legislation would give the Department of Justice and  the Federal Trade Commission authority to apply antitrust laws to  anticompetitive practices in the health insurance industry.  Furthermore, it is the intent of the authors of this legislation that  the DOJ and FTC notify and work with states on investigations they have  received or are undertaking that involve health insurance entities in  their state.  The Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act will restore full  transparency, promote oversight, and encourage competition within the  health insurance industry. I look forward to this legislation being  signed into law by the President.    ", "Ms. WARREN": " Ms. WARREN. Madam President, a little over a month ago I came to the  floor to honor the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a trailblazer, an  icon, and a friend. I shared what she meant as a personal hero for me  and as a role model to millions of other women. I discussed her  groundbreaking work and how much of what she fought for is now on the  line.  I talked about the message Ruth left before she died, stating her  ``most fervent wish'' that her replacement not be named ``until a new  President is installed.''  It has been 37 days since Ruth died. I miss her. America misses her.  It has also been 37 days since Mitch McConnell declared he would  disregard Ruth's ``most fervent'' wish and move ahead with a corrupt  and illegitimate process to fill her seat on the Supreme Court. Just 8  days--8 days--before the election, when tens of millions of Americans  have already cast their ballots and just 15 days before the Supreme  Court will hear a case that could overturn the Affordable Care Act,  Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, and their Republican buddies are shoving  aside the wishes of the American people in order to steal the Supreme  Court seat.  Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans violated the long- established rules of the Judiciary Committee to rush their nominee  through, giving each other a wink and a nod before they turned a blind  eye to their own rulebreaking. They even violated the rule Mitch  McConnell made up in order to keep one of President Obama's nominees  off the Court long before anyone was voting: no confirmations of  Justices in an election year. So they made up the rules, then they  broke those same rules. They cheated.  Why? Why was it so important that they were willing to turn their  backs on the very rules that they had put in place? Why rush through  this nomination?  Why? Because the Republican Party is scared that they can't win  through the democratic process, scared that they can't win by playing  by the rules, that they can't win when the American people decide the  outcome, that they can't win when elections matter.  What we are seeing today is the last gasp of a desperate party--a  party working to undermine our democracy so that they can keep pushing  their extremist agenda just a little longer, a party that doesn't  reflect the views of a majority of Americans or the values that we hold  dear.  This is a party beholden to billionaires and extremists that is  desperate to keep its grasp on power and willing to break any rule, any  precedent, or any principle to hold on to that power just a little  longer. The Republican Senators bat down every concern.  No Supreme Court nominee has been confirmed this close to a  Presidential election. They say: No problem. Republican Senators plunge  ahead with an illegitimate nomination made by a morally bankrupt  President.  The Rose Garden ceremony to celebrate the nomination turns into a  coronavirus superspreader event. Republican Senators brush it off.  Republican Senators will press ahead with hearings while members of the  Judiciary Committee are in quarantine, and some of them refused to get  tested.  Hundreds of thousands of Americans are dead and millions are waiting  for the Federal Government to finally show up and fight this pandemic.  Republican Senators say: Sorry, no time. Senate Republicans have better  things to do than pass a relief package--things like steal a Supreme  Court seat.  Here is the ugly truth: Donald Trump and his Republican buddies know  that [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6498\">Page S6498</a>, ] confirming Amy Coney Barrett to the Nation's highest Court is their  path to advance an extremist agenda long after the country is fed up  and disgusted with their failures. In the middle of an election, in the  depths of a pandemic, their extremist agenda is all that matters, and  that is why they are so desperate to ram her nomination through the  Senate.  The confirmation hearings were a sham. The conclusion was foregone,  and the nominee spent days ducking and dodging legitimate questions  about where she stands on issues of crucial importance to the American  people. It was little more than a PR stunt.  But what the nominee refused to say was actually very informative.  She refused to say whether the ruling upholding the right to  contraception was correct. She refused to say whether the government  can criminalize a same-sex relationship. She refused to say whether it  is wrong to separate children from their parents in order to deter  immigration. She even refused to say whether climate change is  happening and whether it poses a threat to human beings.  This was no hearing. This was a farce.  Their attempt to remain silent on key issues spoke volumes. It shows  that she believes these critical rights, protections, and values are  debatable, up for grabs. And Barrett's refusal to embrace these  commonsense values shows just how out of step, how extreme, Barrett is  and will continue to be if she is confirmed.  Let's be real. We already know what Barrett is all about. We know why  corporate interests and rightwing zealots are so excited about her, why  so many Republicans will vote to confirm her, and why Trump, who has  handed the judiciary over to the Federalist Society, has nominated her.  It is because she will advance their extremist, conservative agenda.  So her question-dodging isn't a problem for them. It is part of their  strategy to get her onto the Court.  They know where she stands, and so do the American people. We already  know because her record is clear.  Take reproductive rights. President Trump pledged to nominate Supreme  Court Justices who would overturn Roe. Listen to him. He said he would  only appoint someone who would overturn Roe, and then he picked  Barrett. In 2006, Barrett signed a newspaper ad calling for the end of  Roe and describing Roe as ``barbaric.'' She was a member of an anti- choice group while on the University of Notre Dame faculty.  And how would she overturn Roe? After all, Roe is the current law of  the land. But Barrett has that all worked out. She holds a dangerously  radical view on legal precedent.  In a 2013 Law Review article, she suggested that the Supreme Court is  not strictly bound by precedent and that public debate about Roe leaves  open the possibility of overruling it. To state it plainly, Barrett  believes women cannot be trusted to make decisions about their own  bodies. She is a clear and present danger to Roe.  When it comes to the Affordable Care Act, again, listen to Trump  himself. He said he would only nominate judges who will end the ACA  law, judges who would take away healthcare coverage from millions of  Americans. He picked Barrett.  Barrett's record indicates that is exactly what she will do--work to  gut key provisions that protect millions of Americans. She criticized  Chief Justice Roberts' opinion in 2012 upholding a critical part of the  ACA, saying that he ``pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its  plausible meaning to save the statute.''  In a media interview in 2015, she said that in another Supreme Court  decision that upheld the ACA, the dissenting Justices who wanted to  overturn the ACA had the ``better of the legal argument.''  While claiming just to follow the text of the law, Barrett's record  shows that her purported ``textualist'' approach is nothing but a  facade, merely a cover for her to reach a result that will further the  interests of those with money and power.  Barrett's record isn't just cringeworthy; it is downright alarming.  On November 10, just 1 week after election day, the Supreme Court will  hear a case that will determine the fate of the Affordable Care Act.  And right now, 17 cases that could undermine the right to abortion care  are one step away from the Supreme Court. Twenty-one States are ready  to go. They have already drafted laws they can pass immediately--laws  that could be used to restrict abortion in case Roe is overturned.  And it is not just reproductive rights and access to healthcare that  are on the line. Trump and his Republican enablers want a Justice who  will rubberstamp Trump's racist and xenophobic attacks on immigrants,  from ripping away protections for our Dreamers to rewriting the census.  Once again, this is exactly what Donald Trump told us he would do after  he lost earlier court cases.  Trump and his Republican enablers also want a Justice who will turn  back the clock even more on workers' rights. Trump wants a Justice who  will erode workers' ability to join together and fight for fair pay and  working conditions and to push back against employment discrimination.  We know this is what they want because those are the policies the Trump  administration has pursued and what Barrett's anti-worker record tells  us that she will do.  There is another thing about Barrett's record that deserves special  attention just 8 days before the election. Trump and his Republican  enablers want a Justice who will strip away voting rights, especially  from communities of color and marginalized communities.  Trump wants a Supreme Court Justice who will help undermine our  democracy. We know this because Trump already told us his game plan to  do it. Trump and his Republican enablers are working to make voting as  difficult, confusing, and scary as possible, and they are using every  tool in order to do it.  Trump has lied repeatedly about mail-in voting. He has falsely  claimed it is a source of rampant fraud. Trump's lawyers have sued  States that have taken action to try to help Americans vote safely  during this pandemic by expanding vote-by-mail. And at the same time,  Trump and his cronies are working to dismantle the U.S. Postal Service,  slowing down mail delivery and creating even more barriers to the  ballot at a critical moment in this election.  We have all seen the President's reckless, dangerous statements over  the past few months casting down on the election itself, peddling the  fact-free claim that this election will be ``the most rigged'' in  American history and that he is ``not sure'' that the election results  will be accurate.  Most alarming of all, Trump has repeatedly refused to commit to a  peaceful transfer of power, and he said that he would not accept the  election results if he doesn't win  And as her confirmation hearing shows, Barrett is just the Justice  Donald Trump is looking for. In her hearing, Barrett refused to recuse  herself in a case that might decide the outcome of the election, and  she refused to say whether she believes that a President should commit  to the peaceful transfer of power.  She also refused to say whether voter intimidation is illegal, which  it is; whether the President can unilaterally delay an election, which  he cannot; and whether the Constitution empowers Congress to protect  the right to vote, which it does.  The stakes have never been higher for our democracy. On one issue  after another, on one right after another, Trump and his Republican  enablers have made it clear that they want a Court that will bend over  backward even further for the wealthy and well-connected while running  roughshod over everyone else. They want a Court that will keep them in  power, even when voters have had enough of their fearmongering and  division and graft, and Barrett is their choice to do just that. That  is why this vote is so critical.  A vote for Barrett is a vote to strip healthcare from millions of  people. It is a vote to turn back the clock on reproductive freedom, to  endanger Dreamers and immigrants, to let climate change rampage  unchecked, to imperil efforts to address systemic racism, to support  workers' rights, voting rights, LGBTQ rights, gun violence prevention-- all at risk.  Ultimately, it is also a vote to rubberstamp an illegitimate process [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6499\">Page S6499</a>, ] carried out against the wishes of much of the Nation and against the  backdrop of a deadly crisis that Senate Republicans have ignored as  Americans have died.  Let's be very clear: If Trump and Republicans succeed in ramming this  nomination through, the American people will expect us to use every  tool we have to undo the damage and restore the Court's integrity.  I am under no illusions here. Democrats have fought tooth and nail,  but the Republicans control the Senate. The reason the Republicans are  willing to break every rule to jam through an illegitimate nomination 8  days before the election is that they have realized a truth that shakes  them down to their core: The American people are not on their side.  People all over this country are fighting to reclaim our democracy.  They are registering to vote, and they are voting. They are voting like  never before. They are speaking out and telling their stories. They are  fighting for a democracy that works for all of us, not just for the  privileged few. And they will continue to fight until they have taken  our democracy back from those who have worked around the clock to  undermine it.  Now, I want to spend some time drilling down on what is at stake with  this vote, starting with the impact that dismantling the Affordable  Care Act will have on my constituents in Massachusetts.  I will start with an op-ed that I wrote with Amy Rosenthal, the  executive director of Health Care for All, and Kate Walsh. She is the  president and CEO of Boston Medical Center. It was published in the  Boston Globe, and it was entitled ``The Affordable Care Act and  coverage for Massachusetts residents is at risk.''  Here is what we wrote:  Dave was laid off from his hotel job in March due to the   coronavirus pandemic, and he lost his health insurance too. A   week later, he was rushed to the emergency room with a lung   problem. With support from an enrollment assister, he was   able to enroll in MassHealth coverage that was made possible   because of the Affordable Care Act, better known as   ObamaCare. He is just one of the hundreds of thousands of   Massachusetts residents given a lifeline by the ACA.  Yet, the multi-year effort to repeal the law is coming to a   head at the worst possible time. Just days after the November   election, the US Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a   case seeking to overturn the ACA. And Supreme Court nominee   Amy Coney Barrett has a clear record on the issue. She has   openly questioned the constitutionality of the ACA, arguing   the Supreme Court's ruling upholding the ACA's individual   mandate was ``illegitimate.'' If she is confirmed to the   court, she may provide the decisive vote to strike it down.   For people like Dave, and more than 23 million others   nationwide, access to health care hangs in the balance.  The need for health care coverage has never been more dire   than during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has laid bare   devastating racial disparities in health care access and   outcomes. The ACA coverage expansions led to progress toward   equity, with the gap with insurance coverage rate for Black   and white adults dropping by 4 percentage points and the   difference between Hispanic and white adults falling by 9.4   points. Instead of building on these important steps,   overturning the ACA would further exacerbate inequities in   access to health care.  The elimination of the ACA would also be devastating for   people with specific health care needs, including 1.8 million   people living with substance use disorders and mental   illness. Protections would also be stripped away from 135   million people who have preexisting conditions like diabetes,   cancer, asthma, and those now who have had COVID-19.   Insurance companies could once again charge women 50 percent   more than men for coverage and impose lifetime caps on   benefits. It would strip a popular feature for families:   coverage for those up to age 26 who have sought coverage on   their parents' plans at a time when youth unemployment has   doubled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In Massachusetts, where our state's health reform law   served as a model for the ACA, many falsely believe we would   be protected if the ACA were struck down. This is not the   case. Thanks to the ACA, a number of new protections were   implemented in the Commonwealth: the provision allowing young   people to stay on their parents' plan and the reduction of   prescription drug costs for seniors caught in the Medicare   ``donut-hole.'' These protections could be gone overnight if   the ACA were invalidated.  In addition, an ACA repeal would impact access to health   coverage and healthcare for hundreds of thousands of   Massachusetts consumers. The state's health insurance   coverage expansions were only possible with the partnership   and funding from the federal government. This is especially   true for the expansion of MassHealth, our Medicaid program,   as well as the availability of affordable coverage through   ConnectorCare. Over 375,000 Massachusetts residents could   lose their health coverage and the state stands to lose up to   $2.4 billion in federal funds. These immense cuts would   create a funding gap that would be impossible to fill even   during normal times. The challenge is even greater now:   According to some estimates, Massachusetts may face a deficit   of up to $6 billion as a result of the pandemic. These   funding shortfalls could have devastating implications for   the health care safety net in Massachusetts.  Taking coverage away from people during the worst pandemic   we have experienced in the last century is simply despicable,   and we should all be outraged. Massachusetts deserves more   from its President and from its government. All of us must   speak up, speak out, and make it abundantly clear that the   ACA cannot be repealed.  Speaking up includes speaking up about how the ACA has transformed  people's lives. So many folks in Massachusetts reached out to my office  to share their stories and how they would be harmed if healthcare were  ripped away, so I want to introduce you to a few of those people:  Marleny, Deb, and Charlie.  Marleny is a single mom from Framingham. She receives her healthcare  through ConnectorCare, the plans we have in Massachusetts for low- income families who don't qualify for any other program. Her children  use MassHealth Family Assistance, which is our CHIP program.  She says that, without the help she gets from MassHealth and from  ConnectorCare, she couldn't pay her rent and bring food to the table  for her kids.  You know, the Affordable Care Act helped Massachusetts expand  Medicaid and more affordable insurance plans like the ones Marleny  uses. But if Trump's Supreme Court nominee overturns the ACA,  Massachusetts could lose $2.4 billion in Federal funding. Over 375,000  people like Marleny and her children could lose their coverage.  Deb from Greenfield knows what it is like not to be able to pay for  healthcare. She told me: ``I was an American whom ObamaCare saved at  the very moment I lost my career and my health.'' She writes: ``You  must step in and take action. We cannot sit idly by while our access to  affordable healthcare hangs in the balance.''  Deb is right, and there are millions of people across this country  who have lost their jobs during this pandemic and economic crisis and  could be in the exact same position that Deb was in.  And, finally, I checked back in with my friend Charlie and her mom,  Rebecca, who live in Revere. Charlie and I fought side by side at the  Capitol during the healthcare fights in 2017.  Her mom reminded me: ``Due to severe preeclampsia, Charlie was  delivered at 26 weeks gestation and weighed 790 [grams]--about 1 pound  12 ounces. She was in the NICU for 3 months. Without the ACA, she would  have exceeded a lifetime cap before ever coming home from the hospital.  Additionally, she would have been uninsurable because her birth was a  preexisting condition. With access to health care, Charlie was able to  thrive despite some pretty significant diagnoses. Now, at the age of 8,  Charlie lives a very much typical life.''  Repealing the Affordable Care Act now would be devastating for  Rebecca and Charlie. They can't go back to lifetime caps or sky-high  rates and denied coverage because of preexisting conditions. None of  these families can.  And, like so many policies, Black and Brown communities will be  disproportionately affected if the ACA is destroyed.  I want to read another op-ed I wrote recently that was published in  Shondaland. It discusses the harm of stripping away healthcare for  communities of color, and here is what it says:  Over ten years ago, President Barack Obama signed the   Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law.   Since then, we've made progress. Millions of Americans now   have high-quality, affordable health insurance. We no longer   have to worry about being denied coverage because of   preexisting conditions. Millions of young adults can stay on   their parents' plans until age 26. States were given the   option to expand Medicaid eligibility--providing coverage to   more than 12 million low-income Americans.  But now, the ACA is at risk because Republicans are trying   to ram through Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to serve as the   next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. They are trying   to push her confirmation through at breakneck speed because   just one [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6500\">Page S6500</a>, ]  week after the November elections, a case to overturn the ACA   will be in front of the Supreme Court, and Republicans want   Barrett to have their back, cast the deciding vote, and   deliver a deathblow to the law.  Republicans have railed against the ACA from the day it was   passed, making its repeal a tenet of their platform in every   presidential and congressional race. They've tried dozens and   dozens of times to tear it down piece by piece--all while   ignoring the plethora of data that demonstrates the good it   has done for the American people. Among the chorus of ACA   detractors is Judge Barrett. While she tried to claim during   her Supreme Court hearing that she is ``not hostile to the   ACA,'' her record says otherwise. She criticized Chief   Justice Roberts' vote in 2012 to uphold the ACA and wrote   reviews questioning the law's constitutionality. Her   nomination is just the latest Republican attack on the   ACA--and if she is confirmed, Mitch McConnell and Donald   Trump might get their wish and succeed in ripping   healthcare away from tens of millions of people during a   global pandemic.  Here's what that would mean: In the middle of the Covid-19   crisis, insurance companies would instantly be able to   enforce caps on coverage or deny coverage to the 133 million   Americans with preexisting conditions like asthma, diabetes,   and even pregnancy. Covid-19 itself could be considered a   preexisting condition for the millions of Americans who have   survived the virus. The 12 million low-income Americans now   covered by Medicaid expansions would lose their coverage,   including more than 850,000 Americans struggling with opioid   use disorder, [people who] rely on Medicaid for life-saving   medication assisted treatment and counseling services.   Millions of young adults would be thrown off of their   parents' insurance, forcing them to pay out of their own   pockets even as many struggle under a mountain of student   loan debt, stagnant wages, and high unemployment rates due to   the pandemic.  And the damage won't stop there. Repeal of the ACA would   have devastating consequences for Black and brown communities   that disproportionately benefit from its coverage. The ACA   helped narrow disparities in access to healthcare in the   United States and provided millions of Black and brown   families affordable options for care. Without the ACA, one in   every five Black Americans, and one in three Hispanic   Americans would be uninsured. If the ACA is dismantled, Black   and brown communities that benefit from Medicaid expansions   would be kicked off their insurance. In the midst of a   maternal mortality crisis that disproportionately impacts   mothers of color, moms across this country could lose access   to the well woman visits and the maternity coverage currently   required by the ACA.  So let's call out the Supreme Court nomination for what it   is--Donald Trump and the entire Republican Party's big chance   to complete a decade-long partisan attack on the ACA and on   Americans' rights to health care. It's the big chance for a   desperate party to impose its extreme views on the people of   this country because they couldn't actually get it done   through Congress.  The majority of Americans want the Senate to wait until   after the election to choose a new justice. It's because this   is a life or death situation for their friends, their   families, and for tens of millions of their fellow Americans.  In 2012, after yet another attack on the ACA was defeated   in the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg wrote that ``the   crisis created by the large number of U.S. residents who lack   health insurance is one of national dimension'' and cited the   ``inevitable yet unpredictable need for medical care'' as a   reason to uphold the legislation. [Justice Ginsburg] was   right. Health care is a basic human right. We fight for basic   human rights. We fight against this nomination. And we fight   any attempt to rip away healthcare from families. We do this   together.  It is not just healthcare for tens of millions of people that is on  the line. A woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions is also  in jeopardy. Roe v. Wade is a landmark case that protects a woman's  right to abortion care. A few weeks ago, I published an op-ed in The  Cut that discusses what this nomination means for the right to abortion  care, and I want to read it now for you. This is what I wrote:  The decision whether or not to bear a child ``is central to   a woman's life, to her dignity. It is a decision she must   make for herself. When government controls that decision for   her, she is being treated as less than a fully adult human   responsible for her own choices.''  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that 30 years ago, at her   Supreme Court confirmation hearing. She understood that   reproductive freedom is foundational to equality and critical   to women's health and to their economic security. Without   access to high-quality reproductive healthcare--including   contraception and safe, legal abortion--we cannot have true   equality.  But President Trump, Senate Republicans, and their   extremist allies just don't care. They've spent almost 4   years of the Trump administration--and . . . many years   before [that]--undermining health care and turning back the   clock on reproductive rights. That's why they nominated Amy   Coney Barrett to sit on the Supreme Court. She's the ticket   for a desperate, right-wing party that wants to hold onto   power a little longer in order to impose its extremist agenda   on the entire country.  President Trump and his Republican enablers have tried to   deny this obvious fact. The President recently said that he   ``didn't know'' how Barrett would rule on reproductive   rights, and Republicans in the Senate have fallen in line.   The Republican Party knows the large majority of Americans do   not support overturning Roe v. Wade. They benefit when we   stay on the sidelines--and they want us to sit back and stay   quiet while our fundamental freedoms are on the line.  But we see right through their radical play.  President Trump picked Barrett as his Supreme Court nominee   to take us back in time. Roe v. Wade established the   constitutional right to safe and legal abortion and has been   the law of the land for over 47 years. But over, and over,   and over again, President Trump has bragged about his plans   to appoint justices who would ``automatically'' overturn Roe.   The Affordable Care Act expanded access to reproductive   health care--like no-co-pay birth control--for millions [of   people]. But President Trump has promised to overturn the   Affordable Care Act in its entirety, and sent his Justice   Department to ask the Supreme Court to do exactly that.  Barrett is Trump's ideal candidate to accomplish his plans.   In 2006, she signed a newspaper ad calling for the end of Roe   and describing the decision as ``barbaric.'' She was a member   of an anti-choice group while on the University of Notre Dame   faculty. She's also been critical of the Affordable Care Act   and the Supreme Court's past decision to uphold the law in   court. Her position on abortion and other reproductive rights   are clear: She believes women cannot be trusted to make   decisions about their own bodies.  If Barrett's nomination makes you scared and angry, you are   right to be: 17 abortion-related cases are already one step   away from the Supreme Court. Twenty-one States have laws that   could be used to restrict abortion in the case that Roe is   overturned. And if Barrett's confirmation is rammed through   quickly, she'll have the opportunity--on November 10--to hear   a case about overturning the Affordable Care Act and a   lifetime on the nation's highest court to undermine the   rights and the values we hold dear.  Access to birth control has changed the economic futures of   millions of women, and access to safe abortion care is an   economic issue, too. For a young couple with modest wages and   piles of student loan debt, the decision to start or expand a   family is a powerful economic [one]. For a woman working two   jobs with two kids already in day care, an unplanned   pregnancy can upend budgets already stretched too far. For a   student still in high school or working toward a college   degree, it can derail the most careful plans for financial   independence. Indeed, one of the most common reasons that   women decide to have an abortion is because they cannot   afford to raise a child.  And let's be explicitly clear: If these attacks succeed,   they will have disproportionately negative consequences for   women of color who are already facing some of the most   insurmountable barriers to abortion care.  Rich women will still have access to abortion and reproductive care,  but it will be Black and Brown women--women with low incomes, women who  can't afford to take time off from work, and young women who were raped  or molested by a family member--who will be the most vulnerable.  This is not a moment to back down. Already, it is inspiring to see so  many women and friends of women coming off the sidelines in this fight,  and we must continue to speak up. Call your Senators and make sure this  conversation is grounded in our real experiences. Men must speak up,  too, because reproductive freedom affects us all.  Voting is already underway across the country, and there are only 26  days before the election is completed. And the data shows that most  Americans want to wait until after the election for a new Justice to be  confirmed. Justice Ginsburg gave us our marching orders: Do not fill  this Supreme Court seat until after the election when the next  President is installed. We will fight hard together to honor her wish.  There are countless powerful stories that demonstrate why abortion  rights are so important. I am going to read a few of them. The first is  from my friend and colleague from Michigan, Senator Peters, who became  the first sitting U.S. Senator to share his abortion story. I will just  read an excerpt of that powerful piece that was published in Elle  magazine.  In the late 1980s in Detroit, Peters and his then wife,   Heidi, were pregnant with their second child, a baby they   very much wanted. Heidi was four months along when her water   broke, leaving the fetus without amniotic fluid--a condition   it could not possibly survive. The doctor told the Peters to   go home and wait for a miscarriage to happen naturally. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6501\">Page S6501</a>, ]  But it didn't happen. They went back to the hospital the   next day, and the doctor detected a faint heartbeat. He   recommended an abortion because the fetus still had no chance   of survival, but it wasn't an option due to a hospital policy   banning the procedure. So he sent the couple home again to   wait for a miscarriage. ``The mental anguish someone goes   through is intense,'' Peters says, ``trying to have a   miscarriage for a child that was wanted.''  As they waited, Heidi's health deteriorated. When she   returned to the hospital on the third day, after another   night without a natural miscarriage, the doctor told her the   situation was dire. She could lose her uterus in a matter of   hours if she wasn't able to have an abortion, and if she   became septic from the uterine infection, she could die.  The doctor appealed to the hospital's board for an   exception to their anti-abortion policy and was denied. ``I   still vividly remember he left a message on the answering   machine saying, `They refused to give me permission, not   based on good medical practice, simply based on politics. I   recommend you immediately find another physician who can do   this procedure quickly,' '' Peters recalls.  The Peters were able to get into another hospital right   away because they were friends with its chief administrator.   Heidi was rushed into an emergency abortion that saved her   uterus and possibly her life. The whole experience was   ``painful and traumatic,'' Heidi shared in a statement. ``If   it weren't for urgent and critical medical care, I could have   lost my life.''  Reflecting on the experience now, Senator Peters says it ``enacted an  incredible emotional toll.'' So why go public with it? ``Well, it's  important for folks to understand that these things happen to folks  every day,'' he explains. ``I've always considered myself pro-choice  and believe women should be able to make these decisions themselves,  but when you live it in real life, you realize the significant impact  it can have on a family.''  Peters decided to share his story at this moment because the right to  make such decisions as a family, free of politics, has never been more  at stake. He is alarmed by the threat of Donald Trump's Supreme Court  nominee, Amy Coney Barrett--the threat she poses to women's  reproductive rights. The very conservative nominee once signed her name  onto a newspaper ad calling Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that  legalized abortion, ``barbaric.'' If Republicans successfully confirm  her to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat, she could reverse legal  abortion in America or significantly curtail it. ``It's important for  folks who are willing to tell these stories to tell them, especially  now,'' Peters says. ``The new Supreme Court nominee could make a  decision that will have major ramifications for reproductive health for  women for decades to come. This is a pivotal moment for reproductive  freedom.''  Senator Peters is right: This is a pivotal moment for reproductive  freedom. I have heard from so many of my constituents about the  importance of Roe and reproductive freedom. I am just going to share  two of their stories.  The first is from Kate, who lives in Medford, MA. Here is what Kate  wrote:  Most of my life, my strong support for abortion was as   impersonal as it was important. A late bloomer, I barely   dated until I was in my 20s, then quickly met and married my   wonderful husband. Our birth control always worked perfectly.   Anyway, we are both family-minded, and dreamed of building   our family big with lots of kids.  My husband and I had one daughter, planned and loved. But   the second child was not so easy. I suffered three   miscarriages in two years before a baby finally stuck.   Pregnancy brought months of crushing nausea. But the sicker I   felt the better, the doctors said, things must be going   [well]. Healthy, healthy, healthy, they told me, time after   time.  By late may, the end was in sight. Big and ripe and   swollen, I bundled myself into the hospital for an   ultrasound. I brought a tiny sweater to knit while I waited.   After an hour of examination, a doctor entered the dark room.   She saw the sweater and asked, ``Is it for the baby?'' I   nodded proudly and showed her how all the pieces would line   up, just so, to fit my newborn daughter. A month was plenty   long to finish such a small project. ``It's beautiful''.   She told me, her eyes filling with tears.  Then she turned the monitor toward me so that I could see   the big, black fluid-filled holes in my baby's brain.  There was so little that I knew that day. I didn't know   about Dandy Walker Malformation or Agenesis of the corpus   callosum. I knew love. I knew fear. I knew my values. And I   knew that I was in Boston, medical mecca, hub of the   universe.  I learned more about brains in general and my baby's brain   in particular. MRI revealed poor prognosis. My daughter would   not likely ever walk, talk, support the weight of her own   head, or swallow. I learned that infant hospice was out of   the question, and that I could not refuse a feeding tube for   my baby.  Dumbfounded, I asked the neurologist, ``What does a baby   like mine do? Just . . . sleep all day?'' He winced. ``Babies   like yours,'' he explained, ``are not often comfortable   enough to sleep.'' I knew what I needed to do. 35 weeks   pregnant, and I was afraid, even, to tell my husband, my   mother, my doctor, my genetic counselor, but I talked to my   family, and I called the hospital. It was a Friday afternoon.   My doctor was busy delivering triplets. I left a message. ``I   want to know all my options,'' I said. ``All of them.''  She called me back at 6:30 p.m. and talked fast. She gave   me the number of an adoption agency in upstate New York that   specializes in medically complex children.  ``I'm so sorry,'' she said. ``But if you want an abortion,   you have to decide right away. You have to call before the   end of the work day, mountain time. You have to be on an   airplane on Monday, you have to show up Tuesday with $25,000   up front. I'm so sorry,'' she said again. I did not have   $25,000. I didn't know if the number led to a safe, legal   doctor, or if it led to some back-alley quack. I knew only my   desperation. I called the number right away. The woman on the   phone was very kind. She, too, apologized. ``But Dr. Hern   does not practice after 36 weeks, and you'll be 36 weeks on   the last day of your procedure.'' ``Yes,'' of course, I said.   ``Of course. I understand. We'll be there. We'll find the   money.''  And we did. There wasn't one day of open banking before our   trip, so a loan was out of the question. We had to rely on my   family. They were able to increase their credit while we flew   across the country and withdraw funds from their retirement   account to cover the bill later in the month. Without them, I   don't know what would have happened. I know, now, about the   abortion funds. But just as I didn't risk asking if what I   was doing was safe and legal, I didn't want to ask for   financial help. Everything felt so fragile.  I met Dr. Hern and his excellent team with great relief.   They explained the procedure. My third trimester abortion was   humane, gentle, safe--safer, even in the 36th week, than full   term live birth. We laid my daughter to rest in my womb that   first day, a Tuesday. Friday morning, after brief labor, I   delivered her whole and still, into the hands of my savior.   He brought her to me after. She was still warm, but not quite   warm enough.  Dr. Hern saved my daughter from immeasurable suffering. He   saved my family from having to go against our deepest held   values. Dr. Hern saved me from my own desperation. And every   step of the way, he saved my dignity.  I want to share one more story. This one is from Wendy in Greenfield,  MA. I will just read a part of what Wendy wrote. She said:  I know firsthand that overturning Roe--whether overtly or   by chipping away at access to abortion until Roe becomes   meaningless--will not stop women from seeking abortions. It   will, however, deny women access to safe abortions. Abortion   has been with us since women have been getting pregnant, and   will continue to be with us no matter what the politicians   and judges decide. In 1961, I was 17 and abortion was not yet   legal, but I was pregnant and did not want to be. I was   fortunate because I was able to tell my parents, and they   helped me find a doctor--but finding a safe, compassionate   doctor turned out to be a different story.  We knew an illegal abortion could be expensive and my   parents didn't have much money, so we made a plan together   that I would go by myself in the hopes that he would take   mercy on me and charge me less.  I know there were many heroic doctors who helped women back   then at great risk to themselves, but this doctor, who I'm   sure had seen other young women who were alone and without   support, thought he could take advantage instead. I remember   finding the somewhat rundown building and walking up a dark   flight of stairs to his office. There was nobody else there,   just the two of us, the office was untidy and dimly lit with   the window blinds down. And the doctor himself appeared   unkempt and unprofessional. His clothes were rumpled, he sat   too close to me and put his hand on my knee and said ``we   don't have to use the word abortion, dear.'  I knew immediately that I did not want this man to touch   me, let alone perform an abortion, so I did what many young   women in my situation back then weren't able to do: I walked   out. I went back down that flight of stairs and out into the   light of the street. I felt--and still feel--it was a narrow   escape.  So we found a second doctor--and in fact this time it was   my younger sister who had a guitar teacher who knew someone,   because that's how it worked back then--and this time my   mother came with me. We had to go at night to the back door,   and though there was no nurse or assistant, this office was   clean and it looked like a real medical office, and the   doctor looked like a real doctor. But he was not a   compassionate man. As I lay there on the exam table with my   mother in the next room, the doctor lectured me the whole   time, telling me I was a sinner, that the abortion was the   ``wages of sin,'' that he hoped I would learn my lesson, and   he threatened that if I made any noise, he would stop the   procedure, I would have to have the baby, and everyone would   ``know my shame.''  Although my experience was scary and humiliating, my story   is not as horrific as many from that time--I survived,   without injury, as many women did not--but that's because I   was lucky. I was lucky to have supportive parents, I was   lucky they could afford to pay, I was lucky to have a   precocious [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6502\">Page S6502</a>, ]  sister, and I was lucky her guitar teacher had contacts, and   lucky he knew of a medically competent doctor. But nobody   should have to depend on luck to get a safe abortion.  Although that doctor tried to shame me, I am not ashamed. I   don't think abortion is shameful and I have never had a   moment's regret. My abortion allowed me to live the life I   wanted and to become a parent when I was able to raise a   child properly and responsibly. This was good for me and my   life, but it is also a social and public health good.   Abortion is a necessary part of family planning and women's   healthcare and denying or restricting access to it means that   women can not safely control their reproduction and therefore   can't really control their lives, which means they can't   participate fully and equally in society. It is bad social   policy to hobble half of the population.  Women of my generation already know what pain and hardship   results from abortion bans, but younger women have grown up   taking abortion access for granted as a right, and I urge   them to speak out and tell their stories. And not only women,   but men, and other family members and friends who have been   involved and who have been affected. Bring up your   experiences in conversation, contact your legislators and   tell them. They are the ones in immediate danger and whose   lives and whose families' lives will be affected.  Senator Peters' story, Kate's story, Wendy's story are just about how  gut-wrenching these decisions are. These are personal decisions that  women should make for themselves.  The Senate has no business taking up a vote on a Supreme Court  Justice who is already committed to taking away healthcare from  millions of people and to take away Roe v. Wade and this protection  from millions of women.  We may not have the votes to stop them, but that does not change the  fact that what the Senate Republicans are doing is wrong. We will  continue to fight it. We will fight it now in the Senate, and we will  fight it come election day November 3.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. BOOKER": " Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, it is good to see you in that seat, sir.  The post of Ambassador to Pakistan is one that is highly relevant to  American national securities, as I think all 100 of us understand. The  person selected to implement the U.S. foreign policy and engage  diplomatically with the Pakistani Government must be someone who  understands that American-Pakistani relationship and the complex and  evolving challenges to regional stability in South Asia. That person  must also be someone who can be trusted by the American people and by  their colleagues at the State Department to carry out U.S. foreign  policy decisions.  Unfortunately, there is a disturbing and documented pattern of  behavior from Mr. Todd that I believe makes him unqualified to serve as  our Ambassador to Pakistan.  From 2017 to 2019, Mr. Todd served in a variety of management  positions at the State Department, including as Acting Director General  and Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and as Acting Under  Secretary for Management.  During that time, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee opened investigations into  allegations that senior State Department officials, including Mr. Todd,  were engaging in prohibited personnel practices against other members  of the State Department's career workforce.  As a result of these investigations, multiple State Department  officials told the committees that the administration wanted to punish  career officials at the State Department often for doing their jobs,  for following procedures and protocols, and also punish them for just  raising concerns about policies that they believed sincerely would be  dangerous or deleterious to American interests.  Mr. Todd was one of the people political appointees turned to to help  carry out a lot of those actions. When asked about those allegations in  the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, it was reported clearly that he  was unreasonably agitated, even raising his voice when asked about just  these routine issues.  The incoming administration has an enormous task. We know the  challenges in that region. In the entire State Department, there have  been challenges as well. We should give that new administration a  chance and not promote someone for what is a really critical  ambassadorship in a very complex and challenging region. We need to  make sure that we have someone prominent in the role who can command  the confidence of State Department officials, and that, in many ways,  gives the incoming administration a chance to deal with that vacancy,  which has been, I will note, vacant for 2 years without a nomination.  He clearly does not have the temperament or the track record of  standing up for his own employees or for the institution of the State  Department.  We should be doing everything in our power to restore credibility to  American leadership, not just overall in the world stage, which I know  we all agree on, but also in that region, and work to repair a lot of  the harm that this individual may have been involved in creating that  hurt morale so much.  I have a lot of confidence in the chairman's leadership. We have a  committee that often works in a bipartisan manner, and I am grateful  for that. It is one of the pleasures I have in serving in the Senate.  This role is critical to the country--the U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan.  Ambassador Hale left the post in September of 2018, and it was a year  before the administration nominated someone to the post. So, again, I  just find it, on top of my previous remarks, odd that the chairman and  others are now saying that we need this Ambassador now. I believe that  is not the case, and I believe that there hasn't been an urgency from  the administration to fill this ambassadorship until today.  So it is for these reasons that I oppose Mr. Todd's nomination, and I  hope that my colleague will move the other five. They are deserving  Foreign Service officers and should be confirmed. They should not be  held up because of objections to the nominee we have been discussing.  So we agree on these five nominees. I truly urge my colleague that we  should not obstruct them because of our differences over one. There is  a true urgency, I believe, in this season to get what we can agree on  done, and disagreement rooted as substantially as I believe this one is  should not hold up the other ones. That is why I think the nominees to  Ethiopia, Mauritania, Malaysia, and Sierra Leone--I do really believe  they should be confirmed today.  I yield the floor.    ", "Ms. STABENOW": " Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, thank you very much. Let me say again  what a pleasure it is to work with my friend from Ohio.    ", "Mr. PETERS": " Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, for over 40 years, inspectors general have  acted as independent, nonpartisan watchdogs tasked with preventing and  uncovering fraud, waste, and abuse in the Federal Government. Simply  put, inspectors general make sure government is doing what it's  supposed to do. To accomplish this immense task, inspectors general  must be experienced in oversight, trusted by both political parties,  and ready to hit the ground running on any audits, investigations, and  other reviews of their agencies.  Unfortunately, the nominee for inspector general that we considered  last week does not meet this basic test.  The Department of Transportation is charged with ensuring that  America has the safest, most efficient and modern transportation system  in the world, so that Americans are able to travel safely and  efficiently by road, rail, or air. The Department has an annual budget  of over $87 billion and employs over 55,000 personnel, with a footprint  in every State.  The DOT inspector general must be ready to oversee the full range of  these activities, from every dollar that funds our highways to every  safety decision issued by DOT regulators. To meet this task, the office  employs over 400 personnel, with an annual budget of over $94 million.  Eric Soskin, the nominee for DOT inspector general, is not qualified  to oversee an agency of this size and scope, or to lead the activities  of one of the largest Offices of Inspector General in the Federal  Government. Mr. Soskin does not have any experience managing large  organizations. He has never worked in an Office of Inspector General,  and he does not have experience in many of the basic activities of such  an office, like audits or inspections. Although he has legal  experience, he has not focused on DOT or transportation issues at any  point in his career.  While I appreciate Mr. Soskin's service at the Department of Justice  and his enthusiasm for the position, he simply lacks the qualifications  to ensure DOT is fulfilling its responsibilities.  I am most troubled, however, by the increasing politicization of  inspectors general by the President and by the majority.  Since 1981, this body has confirmed over 150 inspectors general;  until last week, all but two of these nominees had been confirmed by  unanimous consent, a voice vote, or a unanimous vote. The reason for  this is simple: To do their jobs, inspectors general must be trusted by  each member of Congress and by every American, regardless of political  party.  Until this Congress, when an inspector general has faced significant  opposition, the Senate either worked through any concerns or declined  to advance the nomination. The majority did not force through partisan  or unqualified nominees. That is how we have upheld this institution.  That is how we have maintained trust in the independence,  qualifications, and integrity of inspectors general.  This Congress, we held our first party-line vote in 40 years to  confirm a deeply partisan inspector general nominee. We have now  confirmed yet another inspector general on a party-line vote during a  lameduck session, with a nominee who was already rejected by nearly  half of the Commerce Committee and as well as on the Senate floor.  The inspector general is a position that continues across  administrations. It is one with tremendous authority to look at every  agency record, to interview any employee, and to carry out criminal  investigations. We cannot transform this institution into one of  Democratic inspectors general and Republican inspectors general. This  is not and cannot become a political position.  Inspectors General hold government accountable to the law and to the  American people. And it is our responsibility to protect this  institution and reject any nomination that will undermine their  independent, nonpartisan work.    ", "Mr. JOHNSON": " Mr. JOHNSON. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from Vermont  made a couple of statements that I would just like to repeat the words:  that we are in a crisis; this is an emergency; we can't turn our backs  on the suffering.  I agree. I have agreed for months. But he also said something that is  completely incorrect. You might call it a lie. He said that Republicans  have done nothing. That is not true.  I was on daily calls during the August recess after we had attempted  and were debating internally a trillion-dollar package at the tail end  of July before the August recess, recognizing--and I was one of the  ones pointing out--the fact that we had already passed, as the good  Senator from Vermont said, over $3 trillion in four different COVID  relief financial packages early in the pandemic. At that point in time,  there was $1.2 trillion of that unspent. A big chunk of that wasn't  even obligated. Today, as we stand here debating this now, we still  have a little under $600 billion unspent and unobligated.  So the point I was making to my Republican colleagues during those  last few weeks in July and those conference calls in August was, before  we authorize any more money, before we further mortgage our children's  future, why don't we first repurpose and redirect what we already  passed because what we passed, we passed very quickly because we had  to. We had to do something massively, and we did something massively so  that markets wouldn't seize, so that the people--the individuals who  were out of work through no fault of their own and the businesses that  were shut down through no fault of their own could get financial  relief.  So we came together unanimously, and we did that, but doing it fast,  doing it massively--I certainly knew it was going to be far from  perfect. We found out the Federal Government actually has a hard time  spending $3 trillion because, over the course of a number of months,  they didn't spend it all. They couldn't even obligate it.  So what Republicans did during the August recess--because we couldn't  come to an agreement by the end of July--was we worked long and hard on  a targeted bill, more than $600 billion, $300-plus of it for people on  unemployment, $260 billion for small businesses, $100 billion for  education, and tens of billions of dollars for vaccines and testing and  agriculture and childcare. We offered that on the floor, and 52  Republicans voted to proceed to that bill. Democrats just said no.  I felt it was a crisis, an emergency, and we shouldn't have been  turning our backs on these people who are suffering in September.  Democrats said no. All they had to do was say yes. They couldn't take  yes for an answer.  Madam President, I often use this analogy: I go up to you, because I  know you are a generous person, and say: Madam President, give me 200  bucks. And you kind of look at me with a little shock and say: Well, I  won't give you 200, but I will give you 100. Then I go stomping off and  say: No; it is $200 or nothing.  That is what the Democrats did to over $600 billion in needed and  necessary relief for the crisis, for the emergency, for the people we  don't want to turn our backs on because they are suffering. If they  were really serious and they actually wanted a result, if they wanted  to relieve the suffering, wouldn't the logical thing have been to say  yes, take $600 billion, pocket it, get that relief flowing in  September, and then come back and argue for more? But they said no.  They were cynical. They played politics with it. And that is what they  are doing here today.  I am sure, to paraphrase a widely known saying, that the road to  total national bankruptcy is paved with good intentions. I am sure that  is true. I don't question the good intentions of any Member of this  body. We all want to provide the relief. We all want to relieve  suffering. We all want to help fellow Americans who are hurting through  no fault of their own.  But we talk about suffering. We use words. We don't look at numbers  very often. The Senator from Vermont has offered a few numbers, but let  me quote a couple. Let me just kind of lay it out. I didn't have enough  time to do a chart, so I will try and go through this slowly, but I  think it is important to put this all in perspective.  Prior to the COVID recession, we had a record number of Americans  employed at the end of December 2019. Just under 159 million Americans  were employed. By April, 2 months into the pandemic, 3 months into the  pandemic, employment had dropped to 133 million. That is a loss of over  25 million jobs--25 million--which is why we acted, why we acted in a  bipartisan fashion to provide relief for those people--25 million--who  had lost their jobs.  Now, the good news: It is hard to keep the American economy down when  you don't overtax, when you don't overregulate. So in November--the  latest figures we have--there are now just shy of 150 million Americans  employed again. I realize some are underemployed, but still you have  150 million Americans employed--down about 9 million jobs from that  record high when unemployment was only 3.5 percent. We had a record  economy because we stopped overregulating and we had a competitive tax  system. Now the unemployment rate is 6.7 percent.  In the CARES Act, which I supported because I want to help people,  part of that was the economic impact payments--basically what the  Senator from Vermont is proposing here in this bill he wants to pass by  unanimous consent. It spent $274 billion. It was paid to just under 166  million Americans, for an average check of about $1,673 per person.  You can break that down into households because, according to the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the average check per household was  $2,400. That is 115 million households that got a check--115 million.  Now, remember, at the low point, 25 million Americans had lost their  jobs. We sent checks to 115 million households--4\\\\1/2\\\\ times the number  of people who had lost their jobs.  My problem with the CARES Act, with the first four packages, is it  was a shotgun approach. We just spent money. We just opened up the  spigot, and we just sent it all over the place. We didn't have time to  target it to those who really needed it. As a result--and we are seeing  today--businesses that needed it, business owners, small business  owners, have been wiped out of their life savings. They didn't get  relief.  It wasn't well designed. It wasn't well targeted. And we probably  spent hundreds of billions of dollars and sent it to people who didn't  need it.  We are $27.4 trillion in debt today. That is 128 percent of the size  of last year's economy. If this bipartisan deal goes through, about $1  trillion, we will be at $28.4 trillion in debt--132 percent of our GDP. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7699\">Page S7699</a>, ]  I remember the good old days when I first got here. I ran because we  were mortgaging our kids' future. We were a little over $14 trillion in  debt, and when the economy was over $15 trillion, we were under 100  percent debt-to-GDP ratio.  What the Senator from Vermont is proposing is basically duplicating,  without any reforms that I know of, those economic impact payments from  the CARES Act, another $275 billion, for a total of $550 billion--a  half a trillion dollars sent out again to 115 million households when  right now we have only--not ``only,'' this is tragic. Every job lost is  a tragedy. But we have 9 million jobs less than we had when we had a  record level of employment before the recession--9 million jobs lost,  115 million households. That is 12.6 times the number of jobs that have  been lost.  I think the question needs to be, if we are going do this again, is  there any sense, any information in terms of how the $275 billion is  spent? Well, we have an answer from the Federal Reserve Bank of New  York. They do a monthly internet-based survey called the Survey of  Consumer Expectation. They did two special surveys, one in June and one  in August. The June survey took a look at how those households spent  the $2,400 checks. Here are the results: 18 percent of those checks  were spent on essential consumption--essential; 8 percent was on  nonessential, the fun stuff, I guess; 3 percent on donations--Americans  are still generous--for a total of 29 percent spent on consumption. The  marginal propensity to consume was 29 percent. For the remainder, 71  percent, half of it was put to savings--spent on increasing savings-- and the other half was paying off debt.  They also studied how the unemployment plus-up was spent. It had  pretty similar results: 24 percent of those dollars went for essential  consumer goods; 4 percent, non-essential; 1 percent, donations. Again,  a total of 29 percent was consumed; 71 percent was either saved or used  for debt reduction.  They did another special survey in August, asking those same 1,300  households that they surveyed: How would you spend a $1,500 check? Not  $2,400--$1,500. The response was that 14 percent would be spent on  essential items, 7 percent on nonessential, 3 percent on donations. But  only 24 percent of a new check would actually be spent on consumption;  76 percent would either be saved or pay off debt.  That is not very good economic stimulus. Again, the numbers are  without any reforms, without trying to target the dollars to people who  really need it. I would want to do that. I would like to work with  anybody to try and get that relief flowing as quickly as possible to  get it to the individuals who need it. I am sure the need is still  great. It is greater than 9 million. I understand that. But let's look  at some figures.  I do want to point out a past stimulus in terms of its effectiveness.  In 2009, we had the great recession. Let me quote some employment  figures from that.  In January 2008, we had 146 million Americans employed. Remember,  today we have 149 million. Our record was 159 million, but there were  about 146 million before the great recession.  By December 2009, it had dropped, hit the low point of 138 million  people working; 8 million people had lost their jobs.  In January, 2009, President Obama was inaugurated, had total control  of government, a filibuster-proof Senate, control of the House. He  could pass anything he wanted, and they did. They passed the $787  billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. They did that  in February 2009. At that point, there were 141.6 million Americans  working--141.6 million Americans. The unemployment rate was 8.3  percent. Again, throughout 2009, that stimulus didn't work too well  because unemployment fell to 138 million Americans. It took 3 years--3  years--until January 2012, because of overregulation and overtaxation,  to return to February 2009 levels of 141.6 million Americans working--3  years. That is what we call a slow, nonexistent recovery.  Oh, a quick aside: The Senator from Vermont is talking about how we  need the $600 plus-up for the unemployed because they are suffering.  President Obama, with Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid, with a  filibuster-proof Senate--they provided a $25-per-week plus-up to State  unemployment when they had total control. Now they are demanding $600.  I know that is not part of what the Senator from Vermont is asking for  in terms of a unanimous consent request. I thought it was just somewhat  noteworthy.  Again, I am not heartless. I want to help people. I voted to help  people. I voted for the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, but I also am  concerned about our children's future and the fact that we are  mortgaging it. We do not have an unlimited checking account. We have to  be concerned about these things.  My complaint about the Senator from Vermont's bill--and, quite  honestly, the bipartisan effort--we have $600 billion unspent,  unobligated. Let's work long and hard. Let's look at economic data.  Let's target it properly. Let's not just shotgun it out to the economy  again, wasting tens, if not hundreds of billions of dollars. Let's  focus on that. Let's pretend it is like real money--like it is our  money--and spend it well. We don't need to mortgage our children's  future by another $300 or $400 billion. We don't need to do that.  We can alleviate suffering. We can help our fellow Americans. We  could have done it in September, but the good Senator from Vermont and  all of his colleagues on the Democratic side simply won't take yes for  an answer, and my guess is, they are taking that same stance today. So,  Madam President, I object.    ", "Mr. LEAHY": " Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was going to speak in a few minutes, but  things have been filed now appropriately.  Let me speak in my role not only as the Senator from Vermont but as  the vice chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. We have had  months of delay and painstaking negotiations. Sometimes those  negotiations have gone all weekend long, until midnight, 1 or 2 o'clock  in the morning. But this afternoon, we will have before us a spending  package. It includes all 12 appropriations bills for fiscal year 2021.  It also includes a vitally important COVID relief package. Those are  the numbers and figures, but let's talk about what it means.  It provides funding for programs that are critically important to the  American people, and I would like to see it swiftly passed and on the  President's desk. After all, it is not like we are suddenly rushing  things. We are 2 months and 20 days into the fiscal year. It would be  absolutely outrageous if we delayed it further.  As vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I worked hard to  reach agreement on this Omnibus appropriations bill that will fund the  Federal government through the remainder of the fiscal year, without  relying on a long-term continuing resolution, as sometimes has been  done in the past. That was not an easy task.  The budget caps are very lean this year, and we had to stay within  those. They provided a less than 1-percent increase in nondefense  discretionary spending, and that is to meet the needs of a nation that  is reeling from the worst public health pandemic in a century.  Under normal circumstances, that would be difficult, but it is made  even more difficult because of the global health and economic crisis we  face. Notwithstanding the tight top line, we have produced a bill that  provides important increases in programs that serve the American people  and invest in our economy.  I think the bill finally drives a stake through the heart of the  administration's effort to substantially diminish the role of  government in helping Americans in need and in promoting economic  growth.  We all know that President Trump's first budget proposed to  substantially diminish the role of government. He wanted to cut  nondefense spending by 9 percent in fiscal 2018 and 18 percent by 2021.  He wanted to completely eliminate programs millions of Americans rely  on every day. For 4 years, in Congress, leading Republicans and  Democrats came together and we rejected these ill-conceived, arbitrary,  and reckless cuts.  This year, I will say to my colleagues--those who have worked hard  with us on the Democratic side and on the Republican side and who came  together on this, and, especially, those who worked with us in the  Appropriations Committee--we are going to do the same in rejecting  these arbitrary cuts.  Now, this agreement is the product of weeks of hard work and  compromise. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7897\">Page S7897</a>, ] This is not the bill I would have written on my own. It includes things  I support and, I must admit, some things I oppose. But that is often  the way legislation is. No one Senator gets everything that he or she  wants. But together, we can get things that the country wants, and on  balance, passage of this bill is unquestionably in the interest of the  American people.  Let me talk about some of those things. The omnibus spending bill  includes increases for education and early childhood programs. It  provides more funding for substance abuse and mental health services. I  think every one of us knows, from what we hear from back home, that  these services are of utmost importance in these extremely difficult  times. It provides more for food assistance programs both here and  abroad--the assistance that is desperately needed as many families  struggle to survive during this pandemic. And it includes increases for  housing and homelessness services to help those who are the most  vulnerable. These are all programs that my fellow Democrats fought hard  to include.  I support this agreement. As I said, I appreciate those who have  worked with us weekends, holidays, and after midnight on so many  nights. But I am deeply disappointed that Congress is so unforgivably  late in completing our work. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever  why this bill could not have been finished months ago.  I thank Chairman Shelby, Chairwoman Lowey, and Ranking Member Granger  for their cooperation and partnership. We worked through our  differences on the Omnibus spending bill. As the Big 4, we realized we  had to balance the needs and requests of all of our Members. I urge all  Members to support it.  That is for the Omnibus.  Now, before us today is a much delayed COVID relief package. It, too,  is the product of bipartisan compromise, and while it falls short in  some critical areas, I support the agreement. It is also long overdue.  The American people have been waiting for help for far too long, and I  am worried our Republican leadership took a wait-and-see approach. We  were ready to go on this last summer, but for 270 days Majority Leader  McConnell and the Senate Republicans have blocked every reasonable  effort to provide desperately needed relief, even as Members of their  party said quietly: We wish we could do something.  Now, this package is far from perfect, but time is not on our side.  We cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Let's look at what  the good things are in here. It provides much needed investments in our  economy with support for small businesses--small businesses like those  in my State of Vermont or those in the State of the Presiding Officer  or anybody else here. It provides relief for unemployed workers by  extending unemployment benefits into March. It makes investments in  vaccine production and distribution. It supports health providers,  educators and farmers and transportation providers. It provides  critical investments to expand broadband in rural and low-income areas,  access which is vitally important during these difficult times, when  many schools and many businesses are operating remotely.  It includes another round of direct payments to millions of Americans  who are still struggling to pay their mortgage or their rent and feed  their families and heat their homes and meet their monthly obligations.  Many can't do all those things. Now they will at least get help.  I urged that this bill also includes $4 billion in emergency funding  for the Gavi Alliance. Let me explain that. And I appreciate those  Senators who supported me on that money, the emergency funding for  Gavi. This is for the procurement and delivery of vaccines to countries  around the world whose rudimentary public health systems are being  overwhelmed by COVID-19, whose economies are in free fall due to the  virus. We cannot defeat this global pandemic, and international travel  and Congress will not recover without fighting the virus overseas.  Just as we did during the Obama administration when we were faced  with Ebola, the administration and the Congress came together and said:  Sure, we will protect here in the United States, but we will also work  at getting rid of it in other countries because if it flourishes in  another country, it is an airplane trip away from our country.  I support the package, but I want to be very clear. This COVID bill  is only a first step. We have to do more. Vermonters and the American  people need more.  The direct payments included in this package are a fraction of what  we should have provided, given the dire financial situation of millions  of people across this Nation. People are hungry. Unemployment continues  to plague our economies. We should have acted months ago, but let's at  least act on this today. Families are struggling to pay their rent and  put food on their table.  I will continue to fight for more. I made hundreds of phone calls  from my own State of Vermont. I talked to people whom I never met, but  I know that they are people who are typical of Vermonters, but they are  typical of people in any one of the States we represent. I hear the  fear in their voice. I hear the concern they have. In the middle of  winter, as snow is coming down, do we heat or do we eat? How many meals  should we, as parents, go without so we can make sure our children are  fed? How are children going to do school if they are hungry?  Look at State and local governments. Around the country, they have  laid off over 1.3 million teachers, first responders, and other  employees since March. They need our help. Sometimes there are things  that we don't talk about. Rates of spousal abuse and child abuse have  increased during the crisis. We should be providing funds for the  Violence Against Women Act and child abuse prevention grants, just as  Republicans and Democrats joined me a few years ago when I greatly  expanded--with the help of Senator Mike Crapo in a bipartisan fashion-- the Violence Against Women Act and the things we did. None of us, even  at that time, could have conceived of the crisis we are facing now in  the country.  In my State, Vermonters are facing the coldest, darkest months of  winter. They are struggling to heat their homes. And families need help  paying their utility bills through the LIHEAP program, and we will help  that program. When it is 20 degrees below zero and you have had 15  inches of snow overnight, you can't really look at this as an abstract  thing and say: Golly, maybe we should have a program to heat our home.  You are going to die if you don't.  And we are finally making progress in delivering a vaccine to the  American people, but the pandemic is far from over. We know that,  notwithstanding a lot of the things said about this is on its way and  everybody is going to get one, there are huge gaps in all parts of our  country and getting the vaccine to them.  I will be the first at the negotiating table to work with President  Biden and the 117th Congress to address the many needs that remain  unmet in this bill.  The House will send this bill over to us. I would urge all Members to  vote on it when it comes here.  Again, I have to look back at the history of this body. I have to  look at the people who have worked so hard on so many things over the  years. I know that we have people in both parties who are trying to  address the needs of our country.  I don't say this with pleasure but with sadness, I am the dean of the  United States Senate. Next year, I will start my 47th year in this  body. I have seen us come together at a time when it is needed, but  then I see one of the greatest needs I have seen in my years in the  Senate that we ignored for month after month after month. All of this  could have been done in July or August or September or October or  November, not at the very last minute.  And why didn't we? We had to take time. We had to take time breaking  long tradition--all of the promises that have been given by the other  side. We had to take time to move one special interest-supported judge  after another to lifetime jobs, but they will be paid well. They don't  have to worry about paying their bills.  In all 50 of our States, we had people being tossed out of their  homes, tossed out of their apartments, lost their jobs, unable to feed  their children, or the fear and anxiety a parent has in telling a  child: No, I don't know what tomorrow will be like. I don't know what [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7898\">Page S7898</a>, ] next month will be like. We will pray, and we will hope, but I don't  know.  We could have stopped that anxiety in June, when the House bill came  over here, or in July or in August or September and October and  November. We are doing some of it now.  But I ask every Senator to search their conscience. Wouldn't it have  been better if all of us from both sides did something and said: Put  everything else aside, put aside all the special interest nominations.  Put that aside, and let's care for the one special interest we should  have and that is the American people--care for those men and women who  elected us from either party, who rely on us.  I have never seen this country so split apart or having such fear  except for a privileged few, and maybe that includes us. I am not here  to represent me. I am here to represent over 600,000 Vermonters and  fulfill my oath to the whole country, 320 million Americans. What we  should be doing is saying that never again will we let these kind of  partisan politics slow us and not allow us to go forward.  We know, and it is easy to say now, we should have taken the bill  that came from the House of Representatives last summer and brought it  up on the floor. If anybody didn't like it, file an amendment to change  it. Vote for it or vote against it. Vote for or against the amendments  you might bring up. That is what we usually do. I know how to vote. I  voted over 16,000 times. Why don't we just vote? If we had done that  this summer, it may not be a perfect bill, but it would be better than  where we are. Every Member--Republican and Democratic alike--would have  had a chance to bring up their amendment. They could have made their  case, either win or lose. We go to the committee conference; we have  the bill done.  I say all this not to just be a technocrat of what needs to be done  but to say this is how you reflect the needs of the American people.  We faced the threat of Ebola in the last administration. We stood  together, both parties. We helped the countries that were suffering  from Ebola and, in doing so, we protected the United States of America,  and we helped those in this country who might face it. That was a  shining moment. That was a moment of America at its best. This is not.  I do hope we can do better next year. I know as senior Democrat on  the Appropriations Committee, I will fight to do better. But I also use  my voice and what example I might give as dean of the Senate to say to  both parties: Here is what we do.  I think of such examples as Bob Dole, one of the best leaders this  Senate had, a Republican. He came together with Senator Pat Moynihan,  one of the most brilliant Senators I served with, a Democrat. And that  Republican and Democrat came together and set aside their philosophical  differences, cared for the country, and saved Social Security.  I could give so many more examples. That was a Senate that acted as a  conscience of the Nation, and how did they do that? They appealed to  our conscience. I just use that one example because people said that  they couldn't possibly do the difficult things necessary to save Social  Security. Democrats wouldn't give this; Republicans wouldn't give that.  Instead, you had two Senators of conscience who said: We can do it.  Let's do it. Let's use our leadership and our conscience to bring  others together. And that distinguished the Republican Senator Robert  Dole, and that distinguished the Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick  Moynihan and they came together and we saved Social Security.  Those of us in the Senate in both parties who voted for the final  package knew we were going to have to vote for some things that would  be unpopular with constituencies. But instead of worrying about special  interests or single-issue constituencies, we worried about the men and  women of our States and what they would face if we didn't come  together. And that is what we voted for, and we saved it.  I sometimes say that Senators are merely constitutional impediments  to their staffs, but we could not do the work we do without the staff.  I want to thank the staff who worked tirelessly to produce the bill.  By ``tirelessly,'' I mean until after midnight many nights and weekends  and holidays. When the rest the Senate had gone home, they were still  working. I know them. Much of the time, I would be on the phone with  them. I would be working with them and, finally, I would say: It is so  late. Everybody should go to bed. When I woke up in the morning, there  would be an email sent to me at 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock in the morning  because they kept on working.  So I thank Chuck Kieffer, Chanda Betourney, Jessica Berry, Dianne  Nellor, Jean Taol Eisen, Erik Raven, Doug Clapp, Ellen Murray, Scott  Nance, Rachael Taylor, Alex Keenan, Michelle Dominguez, Tim Rieser,  Dabney Hegg, and all the staff of the Senate Appropriations Committee  on both bills. I would thank Chairman Shelby's staff: Shannon Hines,  Jonathan Graffeo, and David Adkins.  Normally, at this time, Senators might just put these names in the  Record, but I wanted to say them out loud, on the floor, because they  should hear their names said out loud and know how much I appreciate  what they have done, not just for the U.S. Senate but for the United  States of America.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    ", "Mr. CARPER": " Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield.  As Senator Casey leaves, I thought his point about longest night and  every day that follows will be brighter, and some of the provisions  that Senator Barrasso and I, along with John Neely Kennedy, have  included in the Nation's major budget piece of legislation ensure that  it will be brighter.  One of the pieces of legislation, as Senator Barrasso knows, deals  with the phasedown of HFCs, hydrofluorocarbons. They are 1,000 times  worse for climate change than carbon dioxide. Under the legislation  that we have offered, it will phase down their utilization over the  next 15 years by 85 percent. What is that worth? It is worth a half a  degree Celsius--just this one thing, just this one provision.  A lot of people on this planet think the biggest challenge that we  face on this planet right now, an existential threat, is the fact that  our planet is getting warmer and that we need to do something about it.  In this legislation, we do take a big bite out of it.  And my hope is what it will be is that it will serve as a source of  encouragement for other Democrats and Republicans, maybe an Independent  or two, to take other steps as we come back into the new year with the  new administration and make further progress.  One of the great things that I love about our HFC legislation-- thanks, colleague.  One of the great things, Mr. Chairman, that I love about our HFC  legislation is that it shows that you can do good things for our planet  and create jobs. That is what I said: do good things for our planet in  the battle against climate change and create jobs. How many jobs? Tens  of thousands of jobs--in this country, in this country; billions of  dollars' worth of economic growth--in this country--and at the same  time doing good things with respect to climate change.  Interestingly, it is not every day you find legislation supported by  the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce, most major environmental groups, and cosponsored by, gosh,  two-thirds of the Senate--Democrats and Republicans alike. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7916\">Page S7916</a>, ]  In that case, we have done it. We threaded the needle. I just want to  thank the chairman for his leadership and for his patience and the  staff in working with us. And our thanks to Rich Russell, your staff  leader on the majority side; Mary Frances Repko, the staff leader on  our side; and everybody who worked with her.  But more than a decade ago, I remember standing next to my colleague  John Barrasso--I remember standing right over close to where he is  standing tonight, and a guy named George Voinovich came up to me--from  Ohio. He and I had been Governors together for a number of years. Love  the guy.  He said: I am looking for a Democratic cosponsor for a bill. He said:  Do you want to think about it? I said: Well, what is it? He said: It is  a proposal that fosters collaboration between businesses, folks who  have buses with diesel engines, trains with diesel engines, boats with  diesel engines, trucks with diesel engines; and it uses some Federal  money, some government money, in order to use technology that is  available to reduce the emissions from those diesel engines by more  than 80 percent.  I said: Tell me more. And he told me more, and about a day or two  later we signed on and introduced the legislation. He was kind enough  to let me be his Democratic lead.  One month later, it was enacted. I have been here 20 years; I have  never seen legislation with that kind of effect go through just like  that. It was pretty amazing. Every so often, we reauthorize it; we  increase the authorization. We have done it again with respect to  reauthorizing the Diesel Emission Reduction Act.  One of the things I love about it is that it gets a lot of different  stakeholders involved, and for a limited amount of Federal dollars, we  can have a multiplier effect that can be, for every Federal dollar, $5,  $6, $7, $8 that have come in from the private sector. That is the way  we ought to do it.  The last one is USE IT. Not many people think Delaware is a farm  State, but we raise a ton of chickens. I think for every person in my  State, there are like 300 chickens or more. Those chickens eat corn and  soybeans. We raise corn and soybeans. Our farmers have land that is  close to the beach. We have five-star beaches in Delaware: Rehoboth,  Bethany, Dewey, and others. There is always pressure for development  and encroachment on our farms, and developers are trying to buy out the  farmers and pave paradise and put up a parking lot. What we have  figured out how to do is--and it is not just--we haven't figured out  through this legislation, the so-called USE IT Act, but what we do is-- the idea is to take carbon out of the air and to use it for a better  purpose.  One of those better purposes is to replenish the soil in my State, in  Wyoming, in Montana, and other places so that our farmers will be less  inclined to leave the land. They will stay on the land. They will be  able to make money, support themselves and their families. It creates a  virtuous cycle. That is a wonderful thing.  I don't think we are going to be joined here yet--I called him just  to give him a heads-up, but I don't think he is able to get here that  quickly, but John Neely Kennedy from Louisiana was a big part of the  work we did on HFCs. I just want to say, in his absence, a real big  thank-you to him. I want to thank--gosh, I think 70-plus Senators-- Democrats and Republicans alike--who cosponsored our HFC bill. I want  to thank our leadership, especially on our side but on both sides, for  pushing to make sure these three bills would be included in the final  compromise.  In addition to all the other things that were accomplished--and  Senator Casey and others talked about that--we have actually done some  good things for our planet. Senator Barrasso is going to move over and  be the senior Republican on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee  come January. I will remain on Environment and Public Works, be the  senior Democrat. I want to say that this has been a wonderful  partnership, just a wonderful partnership--fun, funny, serious when we  had to be, collegial, and really focused on getting things done for  Wyoming, for Delaware, for the other 48 States as well.  So you are not going to be too far, and I will still be around. We  will have a chance to work on other things. It has been a real joy to  work with you on these three items, and hopefully in the future we will  have many, many more.    ", "Mr. MERKLEY": " Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, Senator Udall and I came here in the  same class 12 years ago. It is hard to believe that 12 years have  passed. How can that happen so quickly? We have seen the Senate in  various chapters as it sought to address the big challenges facing  America.  Colleagues have already noted Tom's intense advocacy for the  wildlands of the West and the poetry that he brought to it in his  speech today with Mr. Stegner's reflections on the majesty and  importance of the wildlands of the West and all of his efforts to  protect those lands.  Colleagues have mentioned how, when folks thought it couldn't be  done, he dived into this partnership with Senator Vitter to drive the  Lautenberg Toxic Substances Act and got it accomplished through months  and months of intense negotiations.  He cares about the function of this body and has shared with us idea  after idea on how we might make it work better--ideas that we should  still work to consider in the months and years ahead.  As he thought about protection of lands, he thought about protection  of the oceans and the role of plastics in the oceans. He spearheaded  efforts for us to reconsider how we produce so much plastic waste and  where it ends up and the damage that it does--a vision that others will  have to carry the baton on after his departure.  He has stood up fiercely for the constitutional vision of a nation  and a government of, by, and for the people, that money is not speech,  and that corporations are not people.  Tom, thank you. Thank you for fighting for the vision of our  Constitution, for a government that can and will take on the issues  facing us. We will miss you. I personally hope that you will have a  major role in continuing to advance the protection of those wildlands  in the West in the near future. All my best, and take care in your next  chapter.    ", "Mr. TESTER": " Mr. TESTER. I object.    ", "Mr. WYDEN": " Mr. WYDEN. Yes. That language was not intended to limit retroactive  compensation for individuals who were previously advised by a State,  that they were ineligible for PUA, nor was it intended to limit  retroactive compensation for individuals who have a regular  unemployment insurance claim in adjudication and later find out they  need to apply for PUA.    ", "Mr. SCOTT of Florida": " Mr. SCOTT of Florida. I suggest the absence of a quorum.    ", "Mr. CRAMER": " Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague Senator Hoeven  in offering this amendment and urging our colleagues to support the  amendment to strip the wind protection tax credit from this massive  bill.  I feel like I am living in an episode of the ``Twilight Zone,'' and I  wish I could say that I am surprised. But I am not, because here we go  again. Despite numerous requests and appeals and deals with the leader  and the chairman of the Finance Committee to not jam this body with a  13th extension of the wind protection tax credit, here we are with  another one in front of us.  Since the credit's inception in 1992--and for a lot of those years I  was a utility regulator--it has always been promised that it would be  temporary and would expire. Last year, we got jammed at the last minute  with another extension, and, rightfully, the people back home are  really, really upset with us. And it didn't sit very well with me  either.  That is why, in April of this year, I led a letter to Leader  McConnell with colleagues from West Virginia, Wyoming, and Georgia  saying it was time to finally level the playing field and get rid of  this market-distorting atrocity.  In July, I led another letter to Chairman Grassley with even more  colleagues--from West Virginia, Wyoming, Tennessee, Oklahoma, and  Pennsylvania--with the same message: Let this credit expire.  Yet here we are again. The requests have fallen on deaf ears, and we  have simply been given another pill to swallow with the extension  today.  Some in this town have pointed to an extension in carbon  sequestration credits like 45Q and 48A, as if they were an equal trade.  They are not. Despite years of pleading, the Treasury Department--yes,  this Treasury Department--still has not finalized regulations. So an  extension of 45Q is moot if there is no way to actually monetize the  credit.  Of equal importance, financial investors have said if renewable  credits are extended, they will absorb whatever tax appetite exists  because they are predictable, and those deals have been done many  times.  Just to reiterate, they can't even utilize 45Q because Treasury  hasn't finished the regulations 3 years after Congress expanded the  credit.  More to the point, while there are some great proposed carbon  sequestration projects planned in North Dakota, their benefit is  targeted, while in contrast, hundreds of miners and the local  communities they have built are being hurt by the extension of the  production tax credit. I strongly support carbon sequester projects,  but to assume that the potential benefits of 45Q or 48A are equal to  the unilateral harm of the wind credit is disingenuous at best.  I have heard from utilities who actually use the wind PTC, but they  said they don't need it because the market is so awash with wind  credits, they can't even monetize them. It is completely upside down.  In fact, the PTC credits are actually taking money away from other  clean energy projects like nuclear clean coal, taking emissions-free  energy right off the grid.  Just a few days ago, POLITICO said this: The simplest option for tax  extenders would be to let all 33 that are scheduled to expire at the  end of the year to be renewed.  I have a simpler plan. Let them all expire. K Street wouldn't like  it, but it would be one less section in this giant package.  One final point, in all of my time in Congress--and that has been 8  years [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7923\">Page S7923</a>, ] now--the wind production tax credit has never been extended through  regular order or an open discussion or even hearings. Despite our  objections or promises from the wind industry that it should expire, in  the 11th hour with the government shutdown looming, it gets dropped  into the Members' laps. That alone should be a red flag that the only  time it has enough chance to pass is when it rides the coattails of our  national defense and the government operations. It is shameful.  I support the amendment from Senator Hoeven, and I urge my colleagues  to support it as well. Let the wind PTC expire  I yield my time.    ", "Mr. HOEVEN": " Mr. HOEVEN. I thank my cosponsors on this amendment and our efforts  will continue.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. SULLIVAN": " Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, despite what you might be reading in  the press, there are a lot of recent, important, bipartisan  achievements happening right here in the Senate. We are going to vote  soon on another major COVID relief bill, which is really important.  That will be our fourth major COVID relief bill this year--much needed,  of course, for the health of Americans and for our economy. I think  that when the history of this very challenging year is written, that is  what is going to be remembered--four major, bipartisan, important  pieces of legislation, not the rancor in the Senate, which has been  part of our history, part of the Republic since the founding of the  Republic.  A number of other major bipartisan accomplishments have also occurred  just in the past few months--the National Defense Authorization Act,  which passed with over 80 Senators; the Great American Outdoors Act,  probably the biggest conservation act in over 50 years; and the Save  Our Seas 2.0, a bill I was proud to author, the most comprehensive  ocean cleanup legislation ever to come out of the Congress. This is  just to name a few.  Let me name another important bipartisan accomplishment that is  starting to occur in the Congress, and that is dealing with China, the  important issue of China and China policy. I know people might be  saying: Wait, are you crazy? China? There is bipartisan agreement on  what is happening with regard to this relationship, the United States  and China?  The answer is, yes, we have made significant progress on this issue,  too, and it is important. I want to explain that a little bit because I  think it is a topic that we need to be focusing on more and more in the  U.S. Senate.  Like the Presiding Officer, I am honored to be completing my first  term as a U.S. Senator and honored, like the Presiding Officer, to have  been reelected to continue my service.  Six years ago when I started my time here in the U.S. Senate, I  started a series of speeches that focused on the U.S.-China  relationship and the importance of it. We all have been focused post-9/ 11 certainly on al-Qaida, ISIS, the big issue of violent extremist  organizations, which has been the appropriate focus. But as I started  my career here 6 years ago, I started to give a series of speeches  where I said the biggest challenge that we face long term from a  geostrategic standpoint for the United States for decades to come is  going to be our relationship with the rising power of China.  What I was saying 4 years ago, 5 years ago in this body is that  nobody is talking about it. It is really important, and we are not  focused on it. You can't say that anymore. Now everybody is talking  about China. There has been an American awakening about China. And that  is good. That is important. That is progress. And it has been  bipartisan.  I want to thank President Trump and his team because I think they  deserve a lot of the credit.  They laid out their national security strategy, their national  defense strategy. These are very well-written strategies that, in  essence, said that in the United States of America, post 9/11, it was  appropriate to focus on al-Qaida, ISIS, violent extremist  organizations, getting weapons of mass destruction. That was clearly  the main focus of our national security.  But what their strategies have been saying is that, yes, we need to  continue to focus on that, but now we need to prioritize the great  power competition [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7905\">Page S7905</a>, ] that is upon us with China as the pacing threat.  As you know, most Senators--Democrats and Republicans--particularly  the ones who focus on national security and foreign policy issues,  particularly those on the Armed Services Committee--they agree with us.  They agree with this reorientation. Again, this is important. This is  progress, bipartisan progress, on what is really going to be one of the  most--what is the most important bilateral relationship in the world.  What we need to start doing--and I say ``we,'' this body, the  Congress, the executive branch--is we need to start putting details and  principles into a long-term strategy, a bipartisan strategy that will  be enduring to address this challenge, to address the challenge that is  the challenge for the next decade--the rise of China and how we, as the  United States of America, need to deal with it. As I mentioned, I  believe this is going to be the defining national security issue for  our Nation for the next 50 to 100 years.  What I want to do today is lay out a couple of key principles on what  I see are some of the ways in which we can bring a bipartisan approach  to addressing this challenge. Last year, I was honored to be invited by  the heritage center--the Heritage Foundation--as part of their lead  lecture series on the Asia-Pacific to talk about this issue. I gave  remarks, an address that I called ``Winning the New Cold War with China  and How America Should Respond.''  Some of the principles that I laid out in that address from some of  my experiences in the U.S. relationship with China over the last  quarter century are what I would like to talk about. Those experiences  for me have kind of run the gamut as a U.S. marine; as a National  Security Council staffer and Assistant Secretary of State under the  exceptional leader, Condoleezza Rice, when she was National Security  Advisor and then Secretary of State; as the State of Alaska cabinet  official in charge of energy and natural resources--which are so  important to my State but also to Asian markets--and as a U.S. Senator.  First things first: I believe, as I mentioned, there has been an  awakening about the challenge posed by China. As I mentioned, 6 years  ago in this body, not a lot of Senators were talking about it. Now  everybody is, and that is important. I also think that there is a  recognition--whatever you want to call the tensions that have arisen-- that the U.S. and China have entered into a much more strategic  competition era--phase--with tensions that I have referred to as a  ``new Cold War'' with each other. This state of relations has only been  exacerbated by the pandemic, which, of course, started in China and was  covered up by the Chinese Communist Party.  When I talk about this issue of a new Cold War with China, I want to  be clear on one thing. This is not a challenge--or tensions--of our  choosing. It is the result of a conscious decision by the Communist  Party leadership of China to overturn key elements of the U.S.-led,  rules-based international order, despite that order enabling China to  emerge prosperous and strong from its so-called century of humiliation.  This new Cold War is not an inevitable consequence of China's rise or  our status as an established power. Rather, I believe, it stems from  China's rejection of becoming a ``responsible stakeholder'' in the  international system that the United States has led since the end of  World War II--a system from which China probably, more than any other  country in the world, has benefited from.  But recognizing that we have this new tension, that we have a new  Cold War with China, does not mean that the nature of the global  challenge is identical to that posed by the Soviet Union or that our  response should be the same. However, it does mean that the United  States and our allies need to recognize this challenge, address it,  counter it in ways that avoid major conflict but in ways that also  avoid compromising our core values and interests and principles in  liberty.  Let me talk a little bit about what I call America's awakening.  Since President Nixon initiated the opening of relationships with  China, many hoped that the country's political and economic system  would open as the country developed and joined this broader, Western- led international system. Others believed that even if the Chinese  Communist Party remained in control, its external behavior and  relationship with the United States would not be affected. When the  United States supported Chinese entry into the World Trade  Organization, President Bill Clinton remarked that American workers and  consumers would be the greatest beneficiaries--American workers.  Ultimately, this has proven not to be true.  Equally misguided was the hope that as China grew economically, it  would liberalize politically. The expectation was that China would  lower its trade barriers and follow WTO practices, respecting  intellectual property rights, promoting basic safety standards for  exports, curbing subsidies of its main industries, and not subjecting  imports--our imports--to illegal, nontariff barriers. None of that has  turned out to be true. China did not meet most of its commitments under  the WTO and still hasn't. Rather, it has employed its new access to  Western markets--American markets--to pursue large-scale theft of  technology, exploiting the openness of the American economy without  allowing American companies reciprocal access to its markets as it is  required to do.  Let me give one example of this that I have seen in my experience. In  2003, over 17 years ago, I was in an Oval Office meeting as a National  Security Council staffer with President George W. Bush, Condoleezza  Rice, and the Vice Premier of China, Madam Wu Yi, at the time. The  President, President Bush, strongly believed in the protection of  intellectual property rights, and he raised this issue with Madam Wu Yi  right there in the office--very aggressively, leaning over in his  chair. Madam Wu Yi looked at the President of the United States and  said: Mr. President, I am in charge of this. We are going to fix this.  We are working on it. You have my commitment, Mr. President. That was  in the Oval Office, 17 years ago.  Where are we on intellectual property theft from China? It is worse  today than when Madam Wu Yi made that commitment in the Oval Office. As  a matter of fact, the U.S. Trade Representative Office estimates that  Chinese theft of American intellectual property costs the U.S. economy  an estimated $600 billion annually, not to mention the thousands of  jobs lost. President Obama also tried to stem these blatantly unfair,  nonreciprocal practices, but Beijing did not honor the common  understanding reached by President Obama and Xi Jinping in 2015,  curbing cyber hacking of government and corporate data for economic  gain. Such theft continues unabated today.  These episodes raise an even bigger problem between the United States  and China. It is the problem that I call ``promise fatigue'' with  China. Think about it. Broken promises extend well beyond the economic  sphere, like intellectual property.  Here is another example. Standing next to President Obama in the Rose  Garden in 2015, President Xi Jinping promised the President of the  United States not to militarize the South China Sea. The commitment was  broken within months, when China took a very aggressive policy of  militarizing many of the islands and built up islands in the South  China Sea to the consternation of every single country in the region.  After enduring this promise fatigue with the Chinese for decades, we,  the Congress, the executive branch of the U.S. Government, are finally  getting wise. Everybody thinks trade should be a win-win, but Chinese  leaders appear to view it much more as a zero-sum game.  Ironically, this promise fatigue and China's predatory, nonreciprocal  trade practices have brought about--and did bring about--the new, much  tougher, and, in my view, much needed approach from the Trump  administration that we had prior to the pandemic.  We have this situation where we are not trusting our relationship  with China with promises that have been made but have not been kept  across a whole host of spheres, where the tensions in the South China  Sea are growing. But this current state of affairs was not preordained.  In 2005, then Deputy Secretary of State and future World Bank  President Robert Zoellick encouraged China in a very well-regarded  speech to become a [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7906\">Page S7906</a>, ] ``responsible stakeholder'' in the international system, which had done  so much to enable China's rise in prosperity. Zoellick's speech  challenged China to change its behavior, to support and promote and,  certainly, not undermine the U.S.-led economic order that had brought  peace and prosperity to China and so many other countries in the Indo- Pacific.  For a time, it appeared that China's leadership was contemplating  this American offer to be a responsible stakeholder in this global  system--the one that we had set up after World War II. In my trips as  an Assistant Secretary of State to China, I heard China's leadership in  many meetings--including in meetings with Hu Jintao, the President, and  other senior leaders--where they talked about being a responsible  stakeholder, where this invitation on working through the system we had  developed was clearly something they were contemplating. But over time,  it has become increasingly clear that the Chinese Communist Party has  rejected this concept, this idea to be a partner with us in bolstering  the international order that has benefited China so significantly.  In fact, the opposite has happened. China is now working to  systemically build an illiberal sphere of influence that threatens to  exclude America and erode our alliances in the region that have kept  the peace in the region for decades. The challenge we face today is  rooted in the attempt by the Communist Party of China to popularize its  authoritarian model abroad to ensure China's rise as a great power  under the Communist Party's leadership. President Xi made this clear at  the 19th Party Congress, where he championed China's model as a new  option for other countries and nations that want to speed up their  development. We must always remember, the Chinese Communist Party's  primary goal in domestic and foreign policy is to ensure the survival  and preeminence of the party.  The key driver of U.S.-China competition and tension today is China's  ambition to project its authoritarian model abroad. China's development  under a Leninist political model serves as an inspiration for many  illiberal actors and aspiring autocrats around the world. It uses its  economic influence as a means of exerting political pressure.  Additionally, Chinese companies and state-owned and state-subsidized  industries are not bound by the anti-corruption laws that American and  Western companies must adhere to.  Chinese indifference to establishing standards of transparency, which  we have certainly seen now with the pandemic, and project  implementation through its Belt and Road Initiative result in elite  deals that concede corruption abroad, weaken prospects for long-term  prosperity, and undermine the sovereignty of weaker nations.  China is seeking to undermine democracy and human rights and the rule  of law and international institutions--from pushing its norms for  controlling cyber space to silencing critics of its human rights  record, including critics in the United States, to pushing for the  enforcement of the Belt and Road Initiative at the United Nations.  China is using its growing voice on the global stage to legitimize an  approach at home and abroad that undermines American interests.  A recent Hoover Institution study argues that China is looking to  gain influence in the United States to shape attitudes and, ultimately,  American policy toward China. And although we have not experienced the  same level of political interference as, say, some of our allies, like  Australia, where politicians and donors linked to the Chinese Communist  Party try to sway the country's policies on sensitive issues, China is  clearly engaged in what the National Endowment for Democracy calls a  significant, sharp-powered campaign to influence American policy here  at home. This recent spy scandal with a Congressman from California is  just a recent example of this.  Fortunately, the Trump administration and Members of Congress on both  sides of the aisle have awakened to the long-term challenge that China  poses to America's national security and economic security interests.  As I noted, the Trump administration's more realistic approach on  China, laid out in its national security strategy and national defense  strategy, offers a clear-eyed view of Chinese ambitions and our need to  counter them. At a time when there is not enough bipartisan agreement-- although, I think there is more than, certainly, we get credit for-- there is broad, bipartisan focus and support within the U.S. Government  and, I believe, in the U.S. Senate on the strategic challenges posed by  China.  So we have had an important American awakening and a good beginning  with the recent U.S. national security and national defense strategies,  and I believe it is strongly in America's interest for the incoming  Biden-Harris administration to continue these strategies that have  strong bipartisan support here. In fact, in my recent meeting with  Secretary of Defense nominee GEN Lloyd Austin, I encouraged such an  approach on national security issues, particularly as it related to  China.  Yet these strategic documents that we are talking about need more  meat on the bones. What are more details and principles that we can add  to the national security strategy of our Nation that can ensure  bipartisan support for a longer term U.S.-China strategy? Let me  recommend five core elements that, I think, should be key in moving  forward with regard to our relationship with China.  First, we need to demand reciprocity in all major spheres of the  U.S.-China relationship. Second, we need to reinvigorate American  competitiveness so we can outcompete and outinnovate China. Third, we  need to continue to rebuild our military's strength and capability.  Fourth, we need to deepen and expand our global network of alliances.  Finally, we need to remember that employing our democratic values is a  huge, critical, comparative advantage in countering China's global  authoritarian influence around the world. So let me briefly touch on  each of these.  First, we need to demand reciprocity. The United States must insist  that the relationship with China be defined by reciprocity and  fairness. For too long, the United States has ignored the promise  fatigue--that I have talked about--with China and accepted unfulfilled  Chinese promises across so many spheres of the bilateral relationship.  You have seen it. When you raise the issue of reciprocity with senior  Chinese officials, whether that be in Beijing or with the Ambassador,  and they finally acknowledge that, yes, the relationship isn't  reciprocal, they say it is because ``China is still a developing  country.''  I would respectfully tell senior Chinese officials: Don't use that  argument anymore. It is an insult to the intelligence of American  officials. We need a reciprocal relationship because every American  understands and agrees with this--that it is about fairness, basic  fairness.  I posed an important question of reciprocity to former Secretary of  State Henry Kissinger at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing a  couple of years ago, and he acknowledged that, to have an important,  sustainable, great-power relationship between two of the most important  countries in the world, reciprocity was critical. The citizens of our  country need to feel that the relationship is fair and that a general  policy of reciprocity is important and critical in that regard, but we  all know it hasn't been that way.  The Trump administration has made significant progress on pressing  for more reciprocal relationships in our trading relationships, which  is very important, but we all know that the reciprocal relationship  doesn't exist. Chinese companies and government-backed investment funds  can come to the United States and buy companies, but we would have no  opportunity to do the same. Yet it needs to go much further than  economics. Let me give you an example. We need reciprocity in the free  exchange of ideas. American journalists are not allowed to travel  freely in China, and if they are not, then, why should Chinese  journalists be allowed to travel freely in the United States?  Similarly--and this body is focused on this--there are over 100  Confucius Institutes, established by the Chinese Communist Party, at  American universities. When I was in Beijing a couple of years ago and  met with senior Chinese officials, I mentioned this.  I said: I was recently with the Ambassador, and he said that just to  go on the campus of Beijing University you need to be accompanied by a  Chinese [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7907\">Page S7907</a>, ] official. So if there were real reciprocity in the relationship, if you  can have Confucius Institutes at American universities, how about we  get James Madison Institutes of freedom and liberty at Chinese  universities?  Of course, the Chinese wouldn't accept that.  They said: Well, Senator, Confucius Institutes only teach culture and  language, and a James Madison Institute of freedom and liberty and  democracy in China would be teaching propaganda.  That is what they said.  This is just one of many examples wherein we must have a reciprocal  relationship between the United States and China going forward.  Second, we must reinvigorate American competitiveness. The United  States is no stranger to global military and economic cooperation, as  we have known throughout the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Our  comparative advantages globally remain significant, but we can and  should do more to bolster other areas at home. We should bolster STEM  education, double down on basic research, and support Federal agencies  like the National Science Foundation.  We need to be able to outcompete and outinnovate China, and,  importantly, better understand China, its culture, its language, its  history, and its strategy with the new generations of Americans who are  focused on these issues, just as Russian and Soviet studies were  emphasized during the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Many of our most  significant challenges--our national debt, infrastructure projects that  take years to permit, an education system that leaves too many  Americans behind, a dysfunctional immigration system--are all self- inflicted wounds.  I believe that the real challenges posed by China, as they become  more broadly apparent throughout our country, will start to spur the  bipartisan motivation that will be needed to address these significant  but solvable American challenges in order to make us stronger.  Third, we must continue to rebuild our military. From 2010 to 2016,  the Department of Defense's budget was slashed by 25 percent. Readiness  plummeted, and at the same time, the Chinese undertook a massive  building of its military and the modernization of its forces while it  also made concrete moves to militarize the South China Sea. History  shows, particularly with regard to America's authoritarian rival, that  American military weakness encourages authoritarian provocations  globally. We must make sure that, as we continue to engage China, a  strong U.S. military provides a hedge against Beijing's contemplating  risky and destabilizing military actions as its military strength and  capabilities continue to grow. China has a long history of using its  military to achieve strategic ends when countries are not ready, and we  must be ready.  As the Presiding Officer knows, I have mentioned that, gosh, almost  25 years ago, I was a young marine infantry officer who was deployed as  part of an amphibious task force to the Taiwan Strait, which included  two carrier battle groups as part of the U.S. response to Chinese  provocations on the eve of the Presidential elections in Taiwan. It was  a long time ago, but it was certainly an example of the American  commitment and resolve of one of our allies during a period of  heightened tensions in the Taiwan Strait that we need to remember and  be able to react to with a strong military.  Fourth, we need to expand and deepen our alliances. The recalibration  of our relationship with China should be done in partnership with our  allies. The cultivation and nurturing of these relationships must be a  foundational pillar of any American strategy as it deals with China.  Our greatest strategic advantage in dealing with China is this: We  are now a rich nation with longstanding historical ties that have been  reinforced by decades of diplomatic, military, and economic cooperation  based on shared values with our friends and allies in the region. By  contrast, China is an ally-poor nation, with North Korea as its closest  friend and ally. The unity of the West and our Asian allies is  essential to maintaining high global standards and transparency,  accountability, anti-corruption, a peaceful resolution of conflict, and  the importance of international law, particularly in the global areas  of sea, space, and cyber space.  Finally, we must employ America's democratic values as a critical  comparative advantage. We should never forget that our democratic  values were critical in our successful victory over the Soviet Union  during the last Cold War. In President Reagan's famous Westminster  speech before the British Parliament in 1982, in which he launched the  National Endowment for Democracy, he argued that America would win the  Cold War not through hard power alone but through the power of our  ideals.  As he reminded our audience and our close allies in Britain, ``Any  system is inherently unstable that has no peaceful means of  legitimizing its leaders.'' China's unelected leaders, like all  authoritarians, ultimately fear their own people. Our leaders do not.  It is fear that has driven China to develop an Orwellian social  credit score to rank its people, while detaining as many as 1 million  Chinese workers in concentration camps. Why else does the Chinese  Communist Party invest so heavily in facial and gait recognition  technology to monitor their own citizens? Why comprehensively censor  the internet to preclude even the most glancing criticism of the  Communist Party and its leaders? Why do China's internal security  services employ more people than the People's Liberation Army, the  world's largest military? The answer lies in fear, and the goal, above  all else, to make sure the Communist Party remains in power.  President Reagan saw the power and promise of our democratic ideals  as a potent critical instrument to challenge America's global rival,  then the Soviet Union, because the aspiration of freedom is universal  and remains the core commonality that underpins the strongest  partnerships of the United States with other nations. The belief that  liberty, democracy, and free markets reflect and strengthen the size of  our alliance system is something that is fundamental to the United  States and our allies during the Cold War with the Soviet Union and now  during our challenges with China. Helping countries protect their  sovereignty so they can be responsive to their citizens and effective  partners of our Nation is imperative at a time when Chinese influence  risks pulling nations into a new ``Sinosphere'' hostile to American  interests and our democratic ideals.  Let me conclude by predicting that the new challenges I describe with  China are going to be with us for decades. We must face this fact with  confidence and strategic resolve and bipartisan work in the U.S.  Senate.  America has extraordinary advantages relative to China: our global  network of alliances, our military power and economic leadership, our  innovative society, our abundant energy supplies--we are now the No. 1  producer of oil, natural gas, and renewables in the world--our world- class universities, the world's most productive workforce, and a  democratic value system that makes countries far more comfortable as  American partners than subservient members of a new ``Middle Kingdom''  led by China.  As a result of the long twilight struggle with the Soviet Union, we  also know what works--maintaining peace through strength, promoting  free markets and free people at home, and having the confidence in  George Kennan's insight that the Chinese Communist Party, like the  Soviet Communist Party, likely bears within it the seeds of its own  decay.  While democracies are resilient, adaptive, and self-renewing, there  are many vulnerabilities embedded in China's perceived strengths.  One-man rule creates acute political risks. Historical grievance can  breed violent nationalism. State-directed economic growth can produce  massive overcapacity and mountains of debt. The gradual snuffing out of  freedom in places like Hong Kong creates spontaneous protests of tens  of thousands and huge global backlashes across the world. China's  budding military power and historical view of itself as a nation and  culture superior to others is beginning to alarm neighboring states,  inspiring them to step up security cooperation with our Nation. Nearly  half of all wealthy Chinese want to emigrate--and these are the winners  from China's four decades of heady economic growth. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7908\">Page S7908</a>, ]  As we have in the past, Americans can prevail in this geopolitical  and ideological contest, but doing so will require a new level of  strategic initiative, organization, and confidence in who we are and  what we stand for. This also means that we must redouble our efforts in  making this strategic case to others around the world, particularly our  allies, and we must continue to work on bipartisan solutions that have  enduring support in this body for decades to come as it relates to our  challenges with China.  I yield the floor.    ", "Ms. McSALLY": " Ms. McSALLY. Mr. President, I rise to give my final speech on the  Senate floor, with a heart of gratitude. Serving and fighting for  Arizona as a U.S. Senator has been the opportunity of a lifetime.  Many times in the last 2 years, I had to pinch myself that this  middle-class veteran became one of only 1,984 Americans to serve in the  U.S. Senate and only 677 to serve in both Chambers of Congress since  our Nation was formed.  Like most Americans, on my life's journey, I have overcome adversity  which could have crushed me but, by the grace of God, gave me a purpose  to fight for others. When I was just 12 years old, my dad died  unexpectedly of a heart attack. I learned at that early age to treat  each day of this life as a gift. I was reminded of that lesson again  this year when my 58-year-old brother Martin passed away. Though it  wasn't from COVID, this type of deep grief--unexpectedly losing a  family member--is one too many of us have faced in 2020. We have been  reminded once again that every moment, every day, every chapter of our  lives is truly a gift.  As it has been for most chapters of my life, I didn't come here in a  traditional or easy way.  I want to first thank Governor Doug Ducey for the blessing to serve  the great State of Arizona, especially during these times of  unprecedented challenges.  Accepting the Governor's appointment to be a Member of the world's  most prestigious and powerful governing body was, like most missions in  my life, a high-risk, high-purpose endeavor. Becoming a U.S. Senator  was the ultimate expression of one of my life's principles: Do things  afraid. I took on the mission with my eyes wide open. I gave it my all,  and I left it all on the field in my fight for the Grand Canyon State.  When I gave my maiden speech on this floor, I shared my approach to  service, which was forged through 26 years in uniform: Honor your oath.  Live up to your calling. Don't walk by a problem. To paraphrase  renowned fighter pilot John Boyd, choose to ``do something'' instead of  trying to ``be somebody.''  As I make the trip back home from DC to Arizona for the last time and  close out this 9-year chapter of my life, I do so with gratitude, with  joy, with no regrets, and with the pride of having represented the most  optimistic, resilient, and gritty people on the face of the Earth.  While my name is on the door of our office here, this has always been  a team effort. None of what we have achieved would have been possible  without an exceptionally talented, selfless, and committed staff, many  of whom are here today. I am so thankful for my team of professionals  in DC and Arizona, who truly embody our core values of integrity,  service, excellence, teamwork, and a ``make it happen'' mindset.  I especially want to thank those who have been with me for all 6  years of my time in the House and Senate: my chief of staff, Justin  Roth, whom I trust completely as my closest wingman to lead our amazing  team through thick and thin; my legislative director, Pace McMullan,  who drives our legislative success and embodies the young, brilliant  talent making a difference on the Hill; my deputy State director, C.J.  Karamargin, who took a risk to join our team first in the House and  built strong relationships across southern Arizona; and Rosa Ruiz, who  has been a tireless case worker to help so many Arizonans left behind  by Federal agencies. They welcomed our larger team in the Senate to  serve the whole State.  Of that incredible group, I want to recognize my deputy chief of  staff and State director, Tanya Wheeless, who brought a wealth of  experience, maturity, and relationships to lead and mentor our Arizona  team, and Alana Wilson, my director of scheduling--really, my director  of everything--who has extraordinary capacity and maturity beyond her  years, and I absolutely could not function without her on so many  levels.  This institution could not operate and the people of all 50 States  would not be served without the intelligent, hard-charging, often young  men and women who choose to work on the Hill in staff positions. They  don't do it for the pay, and they could make much more and work fewer  hours in other fields, but they choose these behind-the-scenes,  unglamorous jobs to be a part of keeping our constitutional Republic  strong. I am so proud and thankful for Team McSally and the profound  and lasting impact they have made for others.  Together as a team, we intervened on behalf of over 7,800 Arizonans  who were getting the runaround from Federal bureaucracies in the last 2  years alone. We secured nearly $7 million of benefits they deserved.  To my fellow Arizonans, it was an honor to be your voice and fighter  on your behalf.  We crafted a legislative agenda that fought for freedom, opportunity,  and security for Americans and Arizonans--the very principles for which  I and my fellow veterans put our lives on the line. We played a key  role in creating a strong economy so everyone has the opportunity to  realize the American dream; rebuilding our military; standing up to  China; securing our border; and transforming the judiciary back to its  constitutional role for generations to come. This includes the historic  opportunity to confirm a pioneering Justice, Amy Coney Barrett, to the  Supreme Court.  We worked together in this Chamber to quickly deliver relief during  this first-in-a-century pandemic, saving lives, jobs, and small  businesses. My thanks to President Trump, Vice President Pence,  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and all of my colleagues who  demonstrated leadership and commitment to these important missions.  We saved the mighty A-10 Warthog from being mothballed--again. I  stood in the gap to ensure due process for a brilliant senior military  leader to continue to serve our Nation, and I told the whole world in a  Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that, as a fighter pilot,  retired colonel, and U.S. Senator, I, too, am a survivor of sexual  assault. My path of healing, of finding my voice and strength to not be  held down or held back, was not easy, but I can truly say, like Joseph  in the Old Testament: What others intended for evil, God used for good.  I am grateful to God for giving me the courage to tell my story, and I  am blessed to be a Senator, not only to lead on reforms that were  signed into law but also to use my platform to be an example of hope  and healing for others.  During my time serving in the Air Force, I developed a commonsense  approach to solving problems that I took with me when I deployed here  to DC. This approach, despite the division, obstruction, and  dysfunction here in Congress, drove me to tirelessly seek common  ground, to find pragmatic solutions that have made a real, tangible  difference in people's lives. We know where we disagree--the lines are  very bright--but I am proud to say my team always looked for where the  Venn diagram overlapped to solve problems and get something  accomplished, and it worked. We tied for the most bills signed into law  in my first year in the Senate, and I am proud to say I will leave this  body ranked as the sixth most bipartisan Senator--because I joined with  many in this Chamber, on both sides of the aisle, to find common ground  for the common good.  As one of the few combat veterans in the Senate, I was uniquely  honored to fight for our military heroes, their families, and veterans.  Too often, our men and women in uniform come home with the invisible  wounds of war. The legislation that my team and I crafted and  successfully got across the finish line gives them the lifesaving  treatment they earned and deserve, allowing them to heal and reach  their full, God-given potential. Those who sacrifice life and limb for  this country--who bear the scars of battle, both seen and unseen, who  ran toward the sound of the guns in godforsaken lands--are the heroes  we can never forget and to whom we owe a profound debt. My deepest hope  is that the work we did to fight for our veterans is a cornerstone of  the legacy we leave here in the Senate.  Over these last few years, I have met so many inspiring Arizonans as  I have traveled through all 15 counties and engaged with people from  myriad backgrounds and experiences. It was an honor of a lifetime to  meet four Navajo Code Talkers when attending National Navajo Code  Talkers Day on the Navajo Nation; to visit with World War II [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7061\">Page S7061</a>, ] vets like George Cross while participating in the 75th anniversary of  D-Day in Normandy; to connect with and encourage Arizona sailors  patrolling the Straits of Hormuz during heightened tensions with Iran;  to secure, then pin an overdue Purple Heart on Iraq war veteran Michael  Letcher; and to tour the border with the Ladd family and other  ranchers--hard-working, patriotic people whom I never would have met  had I not served in Congress.  Over the last several, challenging months, I have been so inspired  and proud to witness Arizonans stepping up to help each other get  through this pandemic. Our small business owners and universities found  innovative ways to make PPE for our frontline healthcare heroes. We  delivered meals to doctors and nurses with church congregations and  packed up food boxes with the National Guard at local food banks.  Even in the midst of such unprecedented challenges, I, like many  other Arizonans, took in the beauty of our great landscapes by hiking  sections of the Arizona trail. On a day-long trek to the bottom of the  Grand Canyon and back with a dear friend, we were joined for part of  the hike by the park's new superintendent. We saw firsthand the  benefits the Great American Outdoors Act would bring to this national  treasure and crowning jewel of our State--legislation we championed in  this very room.  I also went on ride-alongs with Border Patrol and local law  enforcement to experience the challenges they face in keeping our  communities safe and learn how to best support these heroes.  I will miss these life-changing opportunities, but I will always  carry with me the time I had and lessons I learned from Arizona's  amazing unsung heroes.  As we approach the end of a year that has tested our country, I look  forward to spending time, as I do every year, in prayer, thought, and  writing for the year ahead. Sometimes I feel the Lord presses a few  words on my heart--words that are important to keep strong and guide my  spirit for the next year. At the end of last year, three words stuck  out during my time of reflection for 2020. I put these words on sticky  notes on my bathroom mirror to serve as daily reminders: peace, joy,  and gratitude.  In the most difficult year in modern history, I have known a peace  that surpasses all understanding, a joy that can only come from a  loving Creator, and a gratitude that even on the most difficult days,  an almighty God put me on this Earth and in this Chamber to stand in  the breach during this moment in our Nation's history.  Standing up for what is right during challenging times is the  founding ethos of our great country.  Early in my time in the military, a mentor pointed me to the Book of  Esther for guidance as I navigated whether to risk my career to stand  up for what was right. I have carried the lesson of Esther 4:14 as my  life's scripture ever since: Can it be that you were put in this  position for such a time as this?  I was honored to serve with each of you in this Chamber for such a  time as this. We experience this gift of life in seasons, and while  this season is one filled with tumult and challenges, I know we will  get through it as Americans always do--together.  When I was appointed to the Senate, I thought of this season in my  life and decided, if this is the last 2 years of my life, I want to  make it count for others. Today represents a change in seasons for me.  I don't yet have clarity on what my next mission will be, but I do know  who is the author and finisher of my faith and that He created each of  us with a purpose. We live up to that purpose when we live, as John  McCain exhorted to us, for causes greater than oneself.  This mentality was encapsulated by Teddy Roosevelt in a famous speech  more than 100 years ago, one I trust we all know well. I came across  his ``man in the arena'' passage when I was just a teenage cadet in the  Air Force Academy, and it spoke to my purpose-driven spirit, so I cut  it out and put it on my bulletin board. The same yellowed, torn paper  is on my refrigerator today, more than 30 years later.  We can truly say in this short season that we were daring in all we  did to advance worthy causes, and our place shall never be with those  timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat.  It has been a true honor, Arizona. We are an extraordinary State with  extraordinary people. I know our future is blessed and bright just like  our State motto: ``God enriches.'' I have been enriched by the  privilege to fight for you and serve you these past 6 years--2 here in  the Senate.  I wish my successor, Mark Kelly, all the best as he represents our  incredible State in this hallowed Chamber.  Let me close with the words of Apostle Paul, which I hope and pray  will be said about my life in my final days whenever they come. He  wrote: ``I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race. I have  kept the faith.''  May God continue to bless America and Arizona. May we all finish the  race and keep the faith.  I yield the floor for the final time.  (Applause, Senators rising.)  [' [', <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7061\">Page S7061</a>,   Order of Procedure    ", "Mr. CRAPO": " Mr. CRAPO. Certainly. The NDAA conference agreement provides for  whistleblower rewards with a 30 percent maximum of certain monies  collected in cases involving Bank Secrecy Act violations, but provides  for no explicit minimum award requirement.  The conferees agreed that updating the Bank Secrecy Act's  whistleblower incentives and protections was necessary to protect  individuals who provide original information which leads to any  successful judicial or administrative Bank Secrecy Act action brought  by the Secretary of the Treasury or Attorney General and results in  monetary sanctions exceeding $1,000,000.  To accomplish this and to avoid any direct spending complications,  our intention is to authorize necessary resources and work with  appropriators and the administration to ensure that necessary funding  be made available on an ongoing basis, that is effectively offset by  BSA penalties imposed in these cases. Such funding will enable the  Secretary to provide, subject to available funds, substantial  whistleblower awards based upon monetary penalties recovered in those  whistleblower cases.  It was always the intent of the conferees that these awards to  individual whistleblowers are important and justified and that they be  substantial, such that both a minimum and maximum percentage of such  monetary sanction was contemplated. In this case, it is the intent of  the conferees, in addition to the conference report providing for the  stated maximum 30 percent award, to provide for a 10 prcent minimum  award, as both reasonable and sensible.  Finally, it is the intent of the conferees that no such award should  be made available to either employees of the Treasury Department, the  Department of Justice, or covered law enforcement agencies, if the  original information that led to the successful enforcement action is  acquired acting in the normal course of their job duties.  We will work with Senator Grassley and with administration officials  to provide for robust minimum awards which meet the 10 percent  threshold wherever appropriate. We will work with the Senator in the  next Congress to draft legislation that addresses the important  concerns he has raised.  Does Senator Brown agree?    ", "Mr. CASEY": " Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, as we approach the end of another year, I  rise to remember all those American men and women who have given what  President Lincoln called ``the last full measure of devotion'' in  service to this great Nation.  I often reflect on the Gettysburg Address when thinking about our  servicemembers and veterans. We all know this short, somber speech has  reverberated throughout our history with an influence that vastly  exceeds the few minutes for which Lincoln actually spoke. In November  1863, President Lincoln stood on the battlefield in Gettysburg to bless  those brave soldiers who had fallen in what was the bloodiest battle in  U.S. history up to that point. The ``last full measure of devotion''  remark has always resonated with me, as it does with so many Americans,  but Lincoln had another message in his address. He said, ``It is for us  the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which  they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.''  Even in moments of mourning, Lincoln charged those still standing to  rededicate themselves to the hard work of preserving our Nation's  integrity, protecting our fundamental freedoms, and building our  families' security and prosperity. In a time of great division, this  was no small task, and it today remains one of our urgent and most  solemn tasks.  The year after the Gettysburg Address, the women of Boalsburg, PA,  began a tradition that would carry on for generations. They gathered  together to decorate the gravestones of their loved ones who had gone  to God. They wanted to reach beyond the pain to show their fathers,  husbands, brothers, and sons that their memories endure in the hearts  and minds of the living. Honoring the spirit and sacrifice of our  military and veterans isn't just about isolated days of commemoration  on Veterans Day and Memorial Day each year, it is about the work we do  every day to be worthy of their valor, as my father used to say.  As we discuss a potential U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, combat  the resurgence of ISIS in the Middle East, exercise oversight over  other U.S. military engagements overseas, and look to resolve  increasingly complicated global crises, we must not forget those who  have given the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country,  particularly in the most recent wars. The numbers are important: 7034  Americans have lost their lives in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,  with an additional 7 killed in African Command operations since 2001.  This includes 300 servicemembers from Pennsylvania--the fifth highest  toll of any State. Over 53,000 have been wounded, including more than  2,000 from Pennsylvania. Although this administration refuses to be  transparent in its deployment tracking, press reports indicate that  approximately 7,500 Americans are currently serving in Iraq and  Afghanistan, with an additional 65,000 serving in the Persian Gulf and  Saudi Arabia.  This year, for the first time in nearly two decades, Pennsylvania did  not lose any servicemembers abroad. While I am grateful Pennsylvania  did not suffer losses this year, this milestone only serves as a  reminder of the grim toll that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have  taken on the Commonwealth and the Nation. As families of fallen  servicemembers continue to mourn, we must reconsider the nature of our  military commitments overseas and recommit to ensuring those who serve  are taken care of.  These fighting men and women were born into families, not into  divisions and brigades. They are sons and daughters, husbands and  wives, fathers and mothers. Their love for their families is matched  only by their devotion to our country.  But many more bear the scars of war. Some families have a loved one  who served in Iraq or Afghanistan and returned home but was one of the  53,250 wounded. And we must not overlook the unusually high percentage  of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who have died since returning home,  whether from drug overdose or suicide. Thousands of American families  continue to pay a terrible price for the courage and dedication of  their family members who gave life and limb for this country.  As we look to a new year and a new Congress, I am reminded of the  moments when policymakers reached across the aisle, putting partisan  differences aside to implement ideas that best served the American  people. We can think about the establishment of the first system of  State veterans homes after the Civil War, enactment of the GI bill  after World War II, creation of the modern, Cabinet-level Department of  Veterans Affairs under President Reagan, all required foresight and  courage to see come to fruition. The year ahead provides an opportunity  for further bipartisan cooperation in service of our veterans and our  men and women in uniform.  Each of us, those who have served and those who haven't, must be a  part of the effort toward healing. We can meet today's challenges with  the spirit of the women in Boalsburg so many years ago, to remember our  past and keep working towards our future. We can continue our work here  in Washington, in Pennsylvania, and across the Nation, to ensure we are  worthy of the valor of the men and women we commemorate today. I call  on my colleagues in the Senate to reflect every day on the sacrifice of  those who came before us.  As another year comes to a close, we remember and honor those who  have laid down their lives for this great Nation. God bless them.    ", "Mr. REED": " Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to rise and discuss the Fiscal  Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act.  First, I would like to salute the chairman. He has done an  extraordinary job. We have both served on the committee for many years,  and this is probably the most challenging year we have had due to many  different factors: the pandemic, the virtual hearings, all those  things.  And this has been particularly challenging, and the chairman, at  every point, stood up to the challenge and led us. I want to thank him  for that. It was a pleasure working with him.  We all recognize that this legislation passed both Chambers, the  House and the Senate, by overwhelming bipartisan majorities. And it is  very important legislation. That is why it earned this bipartisan  support.  It enhances our national security. It strengthens our military  readiness and defense capabilities. It protects our forces and their  families and supports the defense industrial base.  Despite all that it does for our troops and their families, President  Trump waited until the 10th day after he received it and vetoed it the  last day he could exercise his veto. That was December 23, which made  quite a Christmas for our military personnel and for all of my  colleagues who are here today to start the process of responding to  that veto.  The House already took the first step. They returned on Monday. Once  again, by an overwhelming vote, over 300 Members of the House overrode  the President's veto. Now we face the same task in the Senate. It is my  hope we can quickly and resoundingly override [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7981\">Page S7981</a>, ] the President's veto and provide our troops with what they need.  I will echo what the chairman said. You can go through all the  thousands of pages, literally, but what is the most significant aspect  of this legislation is keeping faith with the men and women who wear  the uniform of the United States. So if anyone has any thoughts about  their vote, just think about those men and women who are all across the  world putting their lives at risk while their families share that risk  and that sense of danger and sacrifice. That is what I think has  motivated the chairman and myself and all of our colleagues on the  committee and throughout this Senate to work hard to get this bill  passed.  There are several reasons being advanced by the President for  suggesting that this bill should be vetoed--the veto should be upheld.  One reason is that he claims the bill fails to include critical  national security measures. Yet this legislation provides critical  tools and authorities for the Department of Homeland Security to  perform network hunting for threats and vulnerabilities on Federal  networks. These tools and authorities would help to counter breaches  like the SolarWinds hack, which is possibly the largest intrusion into  our system we have ever seen by a foreign nation state adversary. We do  not yet know the extent and the degree of intrusion that we have  suffered. In fact, we weren't aware of this intrusion for many, many  months.  One of the disconcerting aspects is that it was discovered by a  private company that is one of the most, if not the most sophisticated  cyber intrusion expert in the world. Yet they were penetrated.  So we have a serious, serious situation on our hands. This  legislation would start giving basic tools, which would allow our cyber  security experts to go into other Departments to look at their  procedures, their policies, all of their cyber activities, and  recommend corrections.  In fact, this bill has done more, I think, for cyber based on the  work of the Cyber Solarium Commission, which was chaired by Senator  Angus King and Congressman Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin and also aided  significantly by my colleague Congressman Jim Langevin of Rhode  Island. They put the work together. We took a lot of the Solarium's  work and put it into this bill. So there is absolutely no credence to  the issue that we have not dealt with national security and cyber  intrusions in particular.  Then again, the President, in his veto message, wrote that one of the  reasons is the failure to essentially repeal section 230 of the  Communications Decency Act. But this issue has nothing to do with the  military--nothing at all. It was designed years ago to provide legal  protections to social media companies so that they could expand and  grow. Frankly, I think it has worked beyond our wildest imaginations.  Everyone recognizes it should be reformed, but reform requires  thoughtful, responsible analysis of the legislation. The effects of the  legislation should offer both sides the opportunity to explain  positions. None of that was done, and none of that can be done before  we conclude this legislative session.  It is more, I think, a personal feud of the President, the section  230 repeal, than it is one of careful, deliberate, thoughtful  legislation by the Senate.  There is another reason the President has used, and that is we have  established a commission to make recommendations for the renaming and  removal of symbols, displays, monuments, and paraphernalia that honor  or commemorate Confederates who served voluntarily with the  Confederacy. There is a clear exemption, by the way, for gravestones  that we would absolutely respect. But these individuals--many of them  who were on Active service with our Army or Navy at the time--decided  to consciously fight against the United States of America. It is that  simple. Yet we have bases that are named after them.  The President said this is part of the American heritage of victory  and freedom, but, again, these are named after men who took up arms  against the United States. In some cases--in most cases, they weren't  particularly exemplary generals, with some exceptions. And it was done  in a way that I think was not to honor the service of these individuals  but to advance other forces.  I think it is time that this history be changed, that this chapter be  closed, and the senior Defense Department officials have indicated they  are open to these changes. There is bipartisan support for cooperation  on this issue. It passed the committee. It passed the floor. It passed  the House. Now, it is in this legislation.  When the President vetoed the bill, he also said it is a ``gift to  China and Russia.'' I would strenuously disagree. This is one of the  strongest bills yet on countering the threat China poses to the United  States and our partners, including allies such as India, Taiwan, and  other countries and regions.  Among the provisions of this legislation is the Pacific Deterrence  Initiative. That is a new authority for the Department of Defense,  modeled after the European Deterrence Initiative and authorizes an  additional $150 million in funding.  This was the work--I was proud to collaborate, but the lead was the  chairman, Chairman Inhofe, and I was his copilot on that one. This is  the first time we really stepped back and said: We have a new threat-- significant threat--rising in the Pacific. We have to take a holistic  review of strategy, capabilities, equipment, and we have to make this a  top priority.  So rather than doing nothing about China, as the President alleges, I  think we have made one of the most significant steps forward in  consciously recognizing the relationship that has developed between  China and the United States.  With regard to Russia and Europe, the conference report enhances our  ability to deter Russian aggression, maintains strong support for  Ukraine, and reaffirms our commitment to the transatlantic partnership,  including by calling for a strong U.S. force posture in Germany.  Now, President Trump also vetoed this legislation because he wants  the ability to remove our military from ``far away and very  unappreciative lands.'' Those are his words. Particularly, I have  concern about the situation in Afghanistan. First--and I have been to  Afghanistan somewhere close to 20 times--since the beginning.  In fact, I was on the first congressional delegation to go in January  after the invasion. I have tried to pay attention to what is going on  there. And one point is that the Afghan people have struggled and  fought with us side by side. They have suffered greatly. I don't think  it is right to say they are unappreciative. I think every day they have  been suffering casualties. They have been fighting with our soldiers-- in fact, in some cases, saving and helping our soldiers survive on the  field.  Second, essentially, the provision allows the President to make the  decision. In fact, he can waive all the provisions we built in by  simply declaring that it is in the national security interests of the  United States and communicating that to the respective leaders in the  House and the Senate. That is something that is almost pro forma. So  the notion that this seriously hampers his ability is misplaced.  What it does, though, is signal that we have to be very careful in  recognizing all of the equities that are involved in Afghanistan. The  fact is that there are numerous terrorist groups there, and we have to  maintain a counterterrorism presence; the fact that, as I indicated  before, the Government of Afghanistan, the Afghan people, in many  cases, have suffered more than we have considering the onslaught of the  Taliban and other forces. So, again, I don't think that reason measures  up to the demands.  The National Defense Authorization Act has passed for 59 years. We  need to ensure it will pass for 60 years by overriding the President's  veto. The House, as I said, has already done that--322 to 87. I  encourage my colleagues to show similar support for our military  personnel and their families and override this veto.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. ENZI": " Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I see that my colleague and classmate is  here on the floor. I got to hear his speech earlier today, and it was  one of the best speeches that he has given and the best instruction  that all of us should listen to.  He has far more experience than just the time that he was a classmate  with me, because he served in the House as well. He is Mr. Agriculture  and has solved a lot of problems in those areas, and it has been a  pleasure to be here with him. And I leave with him. He has done an  outstanding job.  We also like some of the same literature.  The Budget  Mr. President, it has been an honor to serve as the chairman of the  Senate Budget Committee for the past 6 years. There is no question that  these have been challenging times. They have culminated in the current  pandemic that we continue to confront. Throughout all of these  challenges, I am proud to say that the committee has played a key role  in working to address the fiscal challenges facing our Nation. We put  in place policies that helped grow our economy and improve the  congressional budget process.  Now I need to make a clarification for anybody who might be  listening. The Budget Committee is not the spending committee. That is  the Appropriations Committee. The Budget Committee does a roadmap that  is supposed to provide some discipline for the people doing the  spending. That is where we need to do a lot more work.  I want to start off by telling you a little budget story. My youngest  daughter and her family are strict budgeters. They follow Dave Ramsey's  principles, and the whole family participates in monthly allocation of  their resources. It has made a huge difference in their ability to pay  off things and to enjoy life.  A year ago, my older daughter picked up my granddaughters from their  after-school activities and said: How would you like to go to  McDonald's for dinner? Of course, they were thrilled.  My daughter said: Well, maybe we ought to call your parents and see  if they would like it too.  At this point the older daughter, who I think was 11 at the time,  said: Who is paying?  And she said: I am.  She said: Oh, OK, because we have already used our eating-out budget.  That is family participation in budgeting.  As a result, I also have the youngest granddaughter, who saved up for  an Apple watch. Do you know how much restraint of spending that is so  you can reach the goal that you want and buy what you really need? That  is good budgeting.  We can do good budgeting, but we have to have good appropriations to  follow it up too.  The committee has had some real successes over the past 6 years.  We passed four budgets, including the first balanced 10-year  blueprint approved by Congress since 2001.  We also played a key role in helping pass the most sweeping update of  our Nation's tax system in more than 30 years. The passage of the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act started with the approval of the FY 2018 Senate  Budget Resolution. That resolution started the process to construct  legislation that reduced tax rates for millions of Americans and  modernized our antiquated Tax Code. It also supported responsible  energy development that will keep energy affordable and provide a long- term supply for American energy.  Oversight was also a critical part of the committee's work. During my  time as chairman, we worked to ensure the Federal Government was  accountable to the public by boosting transparency, by improving  Federal financial management, by identifying duplication of Federal  programs, and by approving Federal information technology.  Increasing the transparency of our congressional budget process has  also been a major priority. After becoming chairman, I restarted the  practice of publicly releasing regular scorekeeping reports--which we  publish on our committee website--that show how we spent the money.  More recently, we developed information on the budgetary effects of the  various COVID-19 bills. We can get those online. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7399\">Page S7399</a>, ]  Providing information like this on an ongoing basis is one more tool  for committees and taxpayers alike to see how the current law stacks up  against the budget we are required to adhere to. Scorekeeping reports  operate just like regular checkups with the dentist or doctor to help  identify risks and find solutions before more serious problems emerge.  In 2015, we also began regular public oversight hearings with the  Congressional Budget Office. This was the first CBO oversight hearing  in more than 30 years. Because of our efforts, CBO now regularly  publicly releases information, tracking its forecasting records, the  accuracy of estimates and projections, and the data it uses in its  work.  While we have had some successes, there are still many serious  challenges facing our Nation. Even before coronavirus came to our  shores, our country was moving down an unsustainable fiscal path. The  pandemic has only accelerated this, with Congress approving COVID  relief legislation that would add more than $2.6 trillion to our debt  so far. In the near-term this spending, necessary as it may have been,  translated into an overall deficit of $3.1 trillion in fiscal year  2020, more than triple the amount recorded the previous fiscal year.  CBO's most recent ``Long-Term Budget Outlook'' paints an even more dire  picture of deficits and debt rising to unprecedented levels if current  laws remain unchanged--and this represents the best-case scenario.  For decades, CBO, the Government Accountability Office, economists,  and Members of Congress have been raising the alarm that if we  continued on this course, our debt would explode with potentially  devastating economic consequences, leaving us unable to fulfill the  promises of the past. That day always seemed a long time away. But time  waits for no one, and tomorrow is fast arriving.  By 2023, barely 2 years away, CBO projects that debt as a percentage  of GDP will reach an all-time high of 107 percent. By 2050, debt could  reach 195 percent of gross domestic product--which is the amount of  actual production we do in the United States--and the annual deficit  would reach 12.6 percent of GDP. That is where the tax money comes  from.  Spending as a percent of GDP will rise 31.2 percent by 2050,  primarily due to--this is very important--due to rising Social  Security, healthcare costs, and net interest spending.  CBO projects that net interest spending will exceed all discretionary  spending in 2043 and will exceed Social Security by 2046. By 2050,  spending on interest will be larger than any single program. That is  the interest on the debt. That doesn't pay down any debt. That is just  the interest on the debt. By 2050, it will be the single largest  program.  Now, that is assuming we continue with the extremely low interest  rates that we get now. We are not even close to the national average.  We are way below the national average. The national average would be 5  percent. If that were to happen, the only thing we would be able to  fund would be interest on the national debt. You didn't hear me mention  Social Security or Medicare or education or military or any of those  things. That is why I have been mentioning this so often. Interest will  eat us alive.  The amazing part of everything I just said is that this is the rosy  scenario. Increases in spending or interest rates that are higher than  the low rates assumed by CBO means that the outcomes are more severe  than currently recorded. CBO expects rising deficits will have major  negative economic consequences, including lower investment and output  and a greater chance of a fiscal crisis. CBO notes that high and rising  debt would also constrain policymakers' ability to borrow in response  to future unforeseen emergencies, leaving the United States vulnerable  in the face of potential disasters while also risking our national  security.  CBO is the Congressional Budget Office, and it is a nonpartisan  office that helps to make these evaluations. As I mentioned earlier, we  are actually holding them accountable by having them come in and  explain what they projected and how it matches up with what actually  happens. So we should pay attention to them. I actually think that they  come up with fairly low numbers.  I don't want to leave this body with nothing but doom and gloom. It  is not too late to turn things around. We can be successful if we work  together.  Contrary to what most people believe about Congress and what is  reported in the media, I know both parties can work together. I have  seen it firsthand as a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor,  and Pensions Committee and my work with Senator Ted Kennedy and, again,  here on the Senate Budget Committee and my work with Senators  Whitehouse, Kaine, Warner, King, Van Hollen, and others.  Bipartisanship will be key as Congress works to tackle our fiscal  challenges. Instilling the Federal budget process with regular action  and predictability, active legislative oversight and spending  transparency--that is all critical to strengthening our democracy and  reducing our Nation's unsustainable spending and debt.  Since taking the helm of the Committee, we have held more than a  dozen hearings on the topic of budget process reform, soliciting expert  testimony from a variety of sources, including economists, academics,  State and local leaders, former chairs of the Budget Committee, and  even people from other countries. This has been one of my top  priorities as chairman, and we have had some early successes in this  effort.  This includes the committee's unanimous bipartisan approval of new  budget rules that included budget process reforms, which have led to  more orderly, meaningful, and transparent consideration of the budget  resolutions in the committee. We followed those hearings by introducing  and passing legislation, the Bipartisan Congressional Budget Reform  Act, which represented the first bipartisan budget reform approved by  the Senate Budget Committee since 1990.  I want to repeat that. In a bipartisan way, we passed a Congressional  Budget Reform Act, and it represented the first bipartisan reforms  approved by the Senate Budget Committee since 1990. A key focus of  budget process reform is to make congressional budgets easier to pass  and harder to ignore, while encouraging regular order in the normal  funding process. If budgets are going to be a useful governing tool,  they must matter. Budgets are the foundation by which we govern, the  way we establish what matters most to our Nation, and where we agree  limited resources should be focused.  We have seen time and again that when budgets are treated as an  afterthought or as a wish list, our ability to legislate effectively  and fulfill our most basic constitutional duties is made more  difficult, if not impossible.  To restore budgets to their proper role, they must be enforceable,  and they should increase fiscal accountability in Congress. If  lawmakers approve a budget, they should stick to it. To that end, my  bipartisan budget process reform legislation would make a number of  important reforms, including creating a new enforcement tool that could  be used only for reducing the deficit. I realize that we may not get  this bill across the finish line before I complete my service, but I  hope others will take up the effort and ensure the key parts, including  fiscal accountability, are included in future reforms. I have had the  assurance from both Members on this side of the aisle and the other  side of the aisle that that is a possibility and a priority.  Next year, lawmakers will be confronted with the construction of a  new budget and spending bills, and for the first time in almost a  decade, it will be without spending caps. We have had some self-imposed  limits on our spending before called spending caps, and it has been  very irritating to people who want to spend money. But now they can do  that because this will be the first time in almost a decade without the  spending caps contained in the Budget Control Act.  Of course, even under the Budget Control Act, Congress regularly  ignored the fiscal limits it contained, but starting next year, there  will be no budget caps to guide overall funding levels or to curb  Federal discretionary spending--no limits. This could be and should be  a cause for great concern, but it is also a chance for us to work  together to find a way to begin the process to address our fiscal  challenges.  Of course, I mentioned that that is just curbing the Federal  discretionary [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7400\">Page S7400</a>, ] spending. That is the little dab of money that the appropriators  actually get to make a decision on, and 70 percent of what we do is  already passed without a single vote from this body. And that number-- we keep trying to shift discretionary things over to mandatory so  people can be assured that the money will be spent, but seldom do we  ever put any money with the new mandatory item.  But beyond the annual funding fight, our country faces an even more  daunting fiscal crisis: the rapidly approaching depletion of several  Federal trust funds. That includes the Highway Trust Fund next year. It  also includes Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. We have 4 years  on that, 2024. There is the Disability Insurance Trust Fund, 2026, and  the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, 2031. Those are trust  funds that are approaching depletion, running out of money.  OK. In the CBO's latest baseline, total scheduled spending for all  pending trust fund programs will exceed their dedicated revenues by  $12.3 trillion over the next 10 years. This accounts for the majority  of the $13 trillion in cumulative deficits CBO projects the Nation will  run over this period--depletion of the trust funds.  What happens when these trust funds run dry? Current law requires  their spending to automatically be reduced to match their income. This  means real cuts to crucial programs. I mentioned Social Security. It  would have to go down to the amount of money that we actually receive  going out to recipients of Social Security. That could be a big and  immediate hurt.  So, again, a real challenge awaits next Congress as my tenure comes  to a close. I am proud of what the Senate Budget Committee  accomplished. We helped to improve the fiscal health of millions of  Americans by passing the most comprehensive tax reform in a generation.  We have also committed ourselves to working to improve the  congressional budget process so Washington and Congress can get a  better handle on what we are spending and where it is going, including  a new tool that could be used only for reducing the deficit. We have  worked to boost fiscal transparency, improve Federal financial  management, identify duplication of Federal programs, and improve  Federal information technology. But there is much more that needs to be  done, and now those challenges will be passed to the next chairman.  While I have highlighted the problems, I am also leaving a roadmap  with possible paths forward. I would ask all of my colleagues to work  closely together to address these issues, as we can no longer push them  off for someone else to fix later. We need to find the common ground.  Tomorrow is here, and we have to start making those choices not only  for ourselves but for our kids and our grandkids and our country  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    ", "Mr. WICKER": " Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    ", "Ms. CANTWELL": " Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor tonight to talk  about many provisions that are currently moving their way through the  House of Representatives and on our way to us. Obviously, our  colleagues here are, I think, relieved that we have been able to give  relief to the American people; that is, that we have been able to  extend unemployment benefits and add bonuses to those unemployment  benefits in the amount of 300 extra dollars per week, and we have been  able to expand the COBRA tax credit programs to help people who have  been unemployed and not been able to continue their insurance be able  to continue health insurance. This is very important for laid-off  workers in the State of Washington, like the aerospace workers.  We are very glad that we were able to give a stimulus check of $600  per individual and $1,200 for married couples; that we were able to get  the PPP program that helps small businesses so that they can continue  to try to make ends meet as we continue to work our way through this  pandemic; and that we have been able to give $9 billion to healthcare  workers who are stretched so thin on these battle lines, who need every  support that we can give them.  I want to talk about the rental assistance. We are at a point where,  if we didn't act tonight, if we didn't act before we left here, many  more people were going to be without homes. It is so important for us  to have these provisions and programs like SNAP, the additional money  for broadband, for healthcare, and for other things that are essential  in helping to communicate during this pandemic for both healthcare and  for education.  I also wanted to mention work that was done in tandem with this  legislation, specifically on the affordable housing tax credit. The  affordable housing tax credit was always important. Affordable housing  was always important, but in a pandemic, in a COVID crisis, it becomes  even more important. The affordable housing tax credit is something  that Senator Young and I worked on with Senator Wyden and Senator  Isakson, and we wanted to say that we needed to do more than what our  current Tax Code could do in helping build more affordable housing.  The affordable housing tax credit has provisions that have been in  law since 1986, but, actually, using the tax credits and how they  worked have been a fluctuating rate, so the consequence is that the  historic rate of what people could get to use the tax credit has  changed, and this legislation will put a floor of 4 percent in to give  investors a [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7917\">Page S7917</a>, ] bigger idea of what this investment can do for the market.  We believe that it will add, in the State of Washington, more housing  that is needed immediately, more housing that is needed on the national  basis, and help us stabilize things in the near term so that we can  work on affordable housing and how we can put more incentives for  people to build affordable housing.  People know affordable housing doesn't just get built. People don't  just go out and say: I am going to build housing at this low rate.  The tax credit is a tax credit that helps people do it by giving  those borrowers the ability to work with the tax credit. But the  American people have been greatly impacted by so many trends--baby  boomers reaching retirement age, not being able to save, people being  pushed out of the last economic crisis into a rate of unaffordability.  It really has been a dramatic increase.  According to the Hudson Institute, 60 percent of our affordable and  low-cost housing was lost from the housing stock between 1985 and 2013.  That is the housing that we had that was affordable. Basically, the  time period ends, and they end up being swallowed up, like so many  places in Puget Sound, into market-based rates. Literally, people are  pushed out of their housing, and then there is no other affordable  housing in the region.  These tax credits can help us build more affordable housing for the  long run. Over the next decade, nearly 500,000 low-income housing tax  credit unions and 655 other subsidized units will reach the end of  their affordability period. Just like I was saying, they are going to  get to a point where they are no longer in a protection of affordable  housing, and the consequence is that growth and demand are pushing us  even higher.  For example, seniors--10,000 baby boomers retire each day. That means  that those low-income seniors, those woefully inadequate to pay for  increasing housing costs, are going to be growing every single day and  putting more demand on the system.  For veterans, nearly 2.5 million older veteran households--almost a  quarter of men and women who helped protect our country--are cost- burdened. That means they spend more than 30 percent of their income on  housing. The lack of affordable housing in our country has been a  longstanding crisis, but the COVID crisis has made it much worse. One  in five renters is behind on their rent, and the eviction moratorium  expires in less than 2 weeks.  As I said, I am pleased that we are voting tonight, hopefully, on  this legislation that includes a 1-month eviction moratorium and $25  billion for rental assistance and that we will continue to work on  these issues. And I am glad that we are working on the passage of not  just the low-income housing tax credit fix of a 4-percent floor but  also that we will continue to work across the aisle on this legislation  moving forward.  At a minimum, the 4 percent could increase affordable housing  production by at least 130,000 affordable homes over the next decade.  That is critically important--130,000 more affordable homes over the  next decade. It could generate and help us with job growth--162,000  jobs and about $18 billion in wages and impacts to the economy.  Building more affordable housing helps us solve lots of problems. We  have an increase in demand, as I just articulated, and a COVID crisis.  Investing in affordable housing is very good for us in helping our  economy grow and putting a roof over people's heads.  I would also like to mention as part of the small business package,  the Paycheck Protection package, a provision that was supported by so  many of our colleagues to help make sure that we continue to get local  news and information out to the public. People understand that local  news has been threatened ever since the transition to an information  age and has certainly been challenged by what I think are unfair  practices by tech companies and the compensation for material and  proper reimbursement on advertising.  The issue for us is that COVID has created an environment where we  absolutely need to get the news, and we absolutely need to get the  local news. It is imperative that we do what we can in this legislation  to help small newspapers, small broadcasters, small radio stations that  didn't previously get helped in the last COVID package so they can  continue to communicate important local news to people throughout the  United States.  I want to thank Senators Schumer, Cardin, and, obviously, I want to  thank specifically Senator Boozman for working so hard on this  legislation with me and introducing legislation. I want to thank  Senators Klobuchar, Ernst, and many of our other colleagues who signed  on to that legislation, as well as our House colleagues,  Representatives Velazquez and Cicilline and Sensenbrenner, who also  worked hard on getting this provision in, and Senators Rubio and  McConnell for helping us in this process.  These provisions are important to help make sure that large public  institutions, like the University of Washington and others, continue to  also get information out to the public.  This news information and local information isn't going to go away  with the help and support of this bill, but it may be a lifeline in  helping us continue to make sure we have critical public health  information available to the public at all times, and, hopefully, we  will then go on to really understand what has happened to local news  and information and do something in the future Congress to help fix the  inequities that are existing today.  If I could, I also just mention quickly the issue about broadband.  This legislation that we are going to be voting on includes $7 billion  for more broadband priorities, $1 billion for connectivity issues for  Tribal country. I know, as the Presiding Officer knows, that Indian  Country needs a lot of connectivity. So getting more broadband into  those communities will be very helpful.  The COVID package also contains money, additional funding, that I  know Senator Wicker and others worked on for telehealth. Telehealth is  a critical path during the COVID crisis to make sure communities have  the ability to get expert advice into our homes, into our communities,  to connect people with information.  This telehealth grant is a very important program in the State of  Washington. I think we probably got something like $8 million  previously from telehealth, and this will help us continue.  I am disappointed that we did not include priorities in here for the  E-rate program to help close the homework gap. This is something  Senator Markey and others worked on very hard, and it is very  disappointing that we can't come to an agreement on something as  important as E-rate. This legislation provides the ability for hotspots  for people who may be going to college and not going to classes, but  are in or around a university.  I think that is a good idea, but we were prohibited from doing the  same thing for students at the K-12 level. One thing the pandemic has  shown us is that students are at home and need to be able to connect to  stay connected to their education schedule, to do their homework, and  to be part of the education system. I hope that we will address this  inequity in the bill in the future.  I am pleased that, working with Senator Wicker, we were able include  language that gives the Federal Trade Commission new authority to seek  civil penalties for scams and deceptive practices related to the COVID  pandemic. You probably think this is already something that was on the  books, but in reality, the way the Federal Trade Commission has  operated, they had to give a warning first, almost like a cease and  desist. The next thing you know, the same practice would pop up over  here, with somebody making a claim about how safe their product was or  how this would stop COVID or something of that nature.  In my home State alone, the FTC reports that consumers have been  scammed out of nearly $5 million since the pandemic and the number is  over $200 million nationwide. These scams can range in everything from  straightforward identity theft to making all sorts of accusations on  people during the quarantine period.  I want to thank Senator Wicker for working with us on this important  legislation. Now the FTC will be able to go after and find these people  on first- [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7918\">Page S7918</a>, ] time offenses. I think this is so important to do to make sure that we  are policing an environment where public health is so important.  I also want to thank Representative Schakowsky for leading this  effort on the other side of the Capitol.  I also want to talk about very important aviation legislation that we  were able to include as part of the larger omnibus package that is  moving through the House, as I said, tonight.  It is so important that we make safety a No. 1 priority in the United  States. If we want to be No. 1 in aviation, we have to be No. 1 in  aviation safety. Chairman Wicker and I worked with our colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to produce important legislation that improves  the safety reforms needed at the FAA--the safety reforms of oversight  of manufacturing and the certification process, and reforms that will  help us here in Congress better stay on top of the information as far  as the certification process.  This is so critical after the crash of the Lion Air 610 and Ethiopian  Flight 302, both involving Boeing 737 Max aircrafts and the loss of 346  lives.  I can never say how painful this incident has been for those  families. I can never say how much they have suffered in this horrific  tragedy that has befallen them, but I know that these reforms are what  are needed, and their help and support in passing this legislation has  been critical.  I want to thank all of the families who helped us in communicating  why the safety reforms are important, but I want to thank,  particularly, Michael Stumo and his wife, Nadia Milleron, who lost  their daughter Samya Stumo in the Ethiopian air crash, and to let them  know that, even though we are putting a big down payment on safety  reforms in the U.S. Congress by passing this legislation, this process  does not stop with the passage of this legislation.  We need to continue to do more to improve aviation safety and to  continue to act, even on a global basis, to be leaders--the United  States leading the way on what aviation safety needs to be.  I also want to thank our staff: Doug Anderson, Ronce Almond, David  Martin, Laurence Wildgoose, Jonathan Hale, Melissa Porter, and David  Strickland for their work. And on the other side of the aisle: Mike  Reynolds, James Mazol, Simone Perez, MaryAsa England, and John Keyes.  Many Members participated in the formation of this legislation. I  want to thank Senator Duckworth for her work with us on the NTSB  recommendations and flight deck alert system, which were part of this  package of bills to reform the FAA and the FAA process.  I want to thank Senator Moran for his focus on helping us build those  standards that we are talking about as far as the FAA going to ICAO and  saying: These are the continued standards for improvement in aviation  safety.  I want to thank Senator Blunt for his leadership on the Air Grants  Program, a very important program that we think will help build up the  expertise and knowledge of very, very technical subject certification  for people here throughout the process of oversight and legislating and  the executive branch.  I want to thank Senators Cruz and Blumenthal for working on such  critical elements in the legislation as to how the certification  process itself works and what we needed to do to continue to bolster  it.  Tonight, we are sitting one step closer to reforms that really will  be meaningful. It will return the FAA to being in charge of what are  the oversight members of manufacturers who are doing the work of the  certification process. It is clear that the individuals who are part of  this unit report to the FAA. They are supervised by the FAA. You can no  longer have incentives at the FAA for expediting work. You, basically,  now have a new whistleblower protection, thanks to my colleague Senator  Wicker and his incredible work on this legislation. You have better  accountability on misconduct. You create new safety reporting standards  for the FAA employees.  We repeal authorities that would permit a certification by industry.  That industry could continue to make recommendations about the  certification process is something, in specific provisions, that are  repealed here.  We also prohibit interference with FAA designees. That is, no one can  try to influence a manager or someone directly involved in the  certification of the process. We also tried to make sure the process  itself worked better. And, again, many of my colleagues played critical  roles in this.  On required safety system analysis on any plane coming through the  process--whether it was new or a derivative--you still have to do a  safety system analysis. You have to have regulations that are the most  up-to-date as it relates to making sure you comply, as we said in this  legislation, with the NTSB recommendations on flight crew alert systems  and to mandate a safety management system for manufacturers. This is  something that is long overdue. And in some instances, people said: Oh,  the OMB and executive branch don't think we need to do these things.  Oh, these things are cost prohibitive. These are regulations we don't  need to put in place.  Trust me, having a safety management system is essential, and we  should make sure that this is in place as this legislation requires  within the next few years.  This legislation also requires disclosure of safety critical  information. This was something, as I said, our colleagues, Senators  Blumenthal and Cruz and many others, worked on as part of this  legislation.  It also provides expert teams of panels. At the beginning of any kind  of certification process, the FAA will be assisted by the best experts  in aviation, whether they come from NASA or the Air Force or outside  individuals who understand the latest and greatest technology. Why do  we have that? Because we know that we are in an era of unbelievable  technological change in which now the human interface with technology  is so critical. Whether you are going to be in driverless cars or  whether you are in Amtrak with positive train control or you are in the  flight deck of an airplane and the software that is working with it, we  need to understand how people are going to respond to human factors.  We all get frustrated with our own computers and our own software,  but we need to put safety first when it comes to a pilot interacting  with that software in the cockpit of an airplane.  It also helps us make sure that the process for the certification  appeals are strengthened and that we tighten the process. We need to  listen to the engineers on the ground. The engineers are telling us  what we need to do, and we need to listen to them. I hope that the  leaders, both within manufacturing and the FAA, will do that.  As I mentioned, this legislation establishes a National Air Grant  Program. Some of you can think of it here on Capitol Hill as similar to  the Sea Grant Program, a program that was long-established to give us  technical expertise on OSHA and maritime issues here in Congress. We  want the same thing for aviation to exist.  It is too important of a sector and safety is too important to not  have a technical skill set here that can stay on top and replace  individuals as retirements happen throughout the aviation system.  It requires disclosures to Congress of post-crash assessments. If the  FAA goes and investigates a crash, you have to notify Congress of that  information. Why? We want to stay more on top of that information. It  requires an identification of safety trends. I have no doubt that we  are going to hear--when it comes back as these annual reports for the  next several years--that this issue of human interaction in a  technology cockpit is going to continue to be the largest safety trend  issue, just as it is going to be in the automotive area and just as it  is going to be in transportation.  Those are just some of the highlights of a very comprehensive safety  reform legislation.  I want to thank my colleague Senator Wicker for his help, his  leadership, his most recent report on whistleblower activity, and  helping us get this legislation over the goal line.  I also, as I said, want to thank, again, those families. Our hearts  and sympathies are still every day with you as you continue to face  moving forward. We are not going to forget. We are going to continue to  put safety as the biggest priority for us here in the U.S. Congress and  continue to move [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7919\">Page S7919</a>, ] forward on a process that puts the individual engineers on the line  responsible for safety to make sure everyone continues to listen to  their directives and their recommendations.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. SANDERS": " Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, let me briefly respond to some of the  points that Majority Leader McConnell has made, to his inaccurate  statements.  Now, I am delighted that, after years of talking on the floor of the  Senate about socialism for the rich, apparently, that has gotten across  to my Republican friends. Of course, that is what we do every single  day. That is why we have the incredible level of income and wealth  inequality that exists in this country, because, decade after decade,  we have used this body to provide massive tax breaks to the rich and  provide corporate welfare to corporations that don't need it. That is  socialism for the rich. The majority leader is right, but let's talk  about, in fact, what is in this bill.  According to the Tax Policy Center, fewer than 1 percent of the  benefits of the direct payments--that is the $2,000 per working-class  adult that Senator Schumer and I are talking about--would go to the top  5 percent of Americans. Virtually nothing would go to the very, very  rich. The overwhelming majority of those funds would go to the middle  class, the working class, low-income people, who in the midst of this  pandemic are in desperate economic condition.  Again, I am delighted to hear the majority leader talking about  socialism for the rich, and I hope we will continue that discussion in  the next session. Let me talk about the socialism for the rich that the  majority leader is enthusiastically supportive of as the majority  leader helped to lead this body to pass Trump's tax bill.  Now, do you want to talk about socialism for the rich, Mr. Majority  Leader?  Under that bill, Charles Koch--one of the very richest people in  America, who has a net worth of $113 billion--received a $1.4 billion  tax break.  Mr. Majority Leader, that sounds, to me, like socialism for the rich.  Ah, but that is not all.  In Nevada, you have a gentleman named Sheldon Adelson, who is a major  contributor to the Republican Party and a big funder for Donald Trump.  Under that same tax bill led by the majority leader, Sheldon Adelson  received a $560 million tax break. A guy who is worth $34 billion  desperately needed that tax break of $560 million.  Do you want more tax breaks for the rich? Do you want to talk about  socialism for the rich?  Senator McConnell had no problem giving a $104 million tax refund to  Amazon over the past 3 years despite the fact that the company made $30  billion in profits. So the argument that this bill, in any significant  way, benefits the rich is just not accurate, but let us talk about whom  this bill does benefit.  This bill benefits tens of millions of Americans who, as a result of  this pandemic, have lost their jobs and have lost their incomes. Some,  in fact, have lost their lives. These are people who are going hungry  today. We are seeing today a recordbreaking level of hunger in  America--the richest country in the history of the world. All over this  country--and I receive emails from people all over this country--people  are frightened to death that they are going to be evicted from their  homes. Think about what a $4,000 check or a $5,000 check would mean to  those struggling families--husband, wife, kids. In fact, let me give  you an example.  This is a problem taking place all over this country. It is taking  place in Vermont. It is taking place in Senator Schumer's State. It is  taking place in Kentucky. In fact, the State of Kentucky--a very  beautiful State; I have had the pleasure of being there a number of  times--a beautiful State--is the State in which 10 out of the 25  poorest counties in America exist. I am sure Senator McConnell is aware  that, throughout his State, you have thousands and tens of thousands of  people living in economic desperation. I am talking about counties  where 30 to 40 percent of people are living in poverty and where many  thousands of residents are trying to survive on less than $20,000 a  year.  I am just using Kentucky as an example because that is the State  Senator McConnell represents, but it is true all over this country.  In Kentucky, over 22 percent of the children are living in poverty.  Do you think they might need a little bit of help?  In the State of Kentucky, more than 190,000 workers are making  extremely low wages, and over a half a million people earn less than  $15 an hour. Somebody might want to ask those people what a $2,000  check per adult would mean. I am talking about Kentucky, and I will  never forget this because I visited Kentucky and talked to some of the  people there. Kentucky has suffered from a particular opioid crisis. I  will never forget talking to a football coach who told me that a bunch  of the kids on his football team were living with their grandparents or  on couches because of the opioid epidemic.  In other words, the people in Kentucky, the people in New York, and  the people in Vermont are hurting. They need help.  So I say today to Senator McConnell, the leader here, let us address  the horrendous economic crisis facing tens of millions of Americans.  The pandemic today is worse than it has ever been. Hopefully,  hopefully, the vaccine will make a profound difference, but, right now,  people are hurting, and they are looking to this institution. They are  looking to Congress. The House did the right thing. They are now  looking to the Senate. They are looking to Senator McConnell.  After all is said and done and after all of the legalese--and I am  going to be introducing some legalese in a moment--it comes down to one  thing: Senator McConnell disagrees with the proposal that Senator  Schumer and I are making. I got it. That is fine. This is a democracy.  He has the right to his point of view. I would love to have the debate  on the floor with Senator McConnell about this legislation. All that we  are asking is to give us the opportunity to vote up or down on whether  or not working families in this country should be able to receive a  $2,000 check. Senator McConnell disagrees.  Come to the floor. Tell us why you disagree. Then we will do what  this institution is supposed to do. We will have a vote. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7988\">Page S7988</a>, ]  The truth is, in the House, Senator McConnell knows that 44  Republicans voted for the House bill, which won, by the way, by a 2-to- 1 majority. Two-thirds of the House voted to make sure that working  Americans would get a $2,000 check. Right here in the Senate, there are  a number of Republicans--it is not clear how many--who have already  gone public in saying they think it is a good idea that we go forward  with the House bill.  So all that I am asking Senator McConnell is to give us a vote. What  is the problem? You can vote no. By the way, we need 60 votes--a  majority. There is no question in my mind that a majority of the  Senators will vote yes, but because of house rules, we need 60 votes.  So we are going to have to get 48 Democrats--that is what we have--plus  12 Republicans. Can we get 12 Republicans? I don't know--maybe we can;  maybe we can't--but give us a vote. What is the problem? What is the  problem with having the American people see how their Senators vote on  this issue of such enormous importance?  As Senator Schumer indicated, Senator McConnell has some other  concerns.  He is concerned about section 230 of the 1996 Federal  Telecommunications Act. I am sure that this is absolutely on the minds  of everybody in Vermont, in New York, and in Kentucky. It is probably  all that they are talking about, the 1996 Telecommunications Act. Fine.  If he wants a vote on that, bring it to the floor. Let's vote on it as  a separate bill.  Do you want to talk about election security? Senator Schumer is  right. There are a lot of issues out there. I am concerned about voter  suppression. I am concerned about people waiting online for 5 hours to  cast a vote. I am concerned about voter intimidation. Senator McConnell  has different points of view. Let's have that discussion. Put together  a commission. No problem. Bring that bill to the floor. Yet everybody  understands that, when you combine all three elements, this is a poison  pill designed to kill that legislation.  After everything is said and done, all of this comes down to one  simple fact: Will Senator McConnell, the Republican leader of the U.S.  Senate, allow this body to vote on a bill which will provide $2,000 per  person to working-class families all across this country? That is what  this whole debate is about. It is not whether you like the bill or you  don't like it. We can have that debate. We have 3 days left in this  Congress. The House did the right thing. It is now time for the Senate  to have that vote.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3 p.m. today,  Thursday, December 31, the Senate proceed to the consideration of  Calendar No. 645, \", H.R. 9051, ', to provide a $2,000 direct payment to the  working class; that the bill be considered read a third time and the  Senate vote on the passage of the bill; and that if passed, the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; further, that  following the vote on ', H.R. 9051, ', the Senate resume consideration of the  veto message on ', H.R. 6395, \", the National Defense Authorization Act, and  the Senate vote on the passage of the bill, the objections of the  President to the contrary notwithstanding, all with no intervening  action or debate.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?    ", "Mr. TILLIS": " Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, today I want to say a word about the need  to revise title 18 so that criminal commercial enterprises that stream  pirated content to users are subject to the same felony penalties as  criminal commercial enterprises that distribute to users or reproduce  pirated content. The provisions of the Protecting Lawful Streaming Act  target clearly criminal conduct committed with criminal intent. Lawful  internet and streaming services, licensees, other mainstream  businesses, and users engaged in ordinary activities do not risk  prosecution. Most importantly, businesses engaged in those activities  are clearly excluded by the requirements that a defendant be engaged in  conduct that is primarily designed, intentionally marketed, or has no  commercially significant purpose or use other than for use in illegal  streaming. Nor do those engaged in noncommercial activities risk  prosecution under this statute. Noncommercial activities are explicitly  excluded by the terms of section 2319C(a). It is intended that none of  these activities shall be subject to any risk of criminal prosecution  under this bill.  More generally, it is well established that criminal penalties are  the exception rather than the rule in cases of copyright infringement.  As the Department of Justice itself has noted, criminal sanctions are  appropriate only with respect to certain types of infringement-- generally when infringer knows the infringement is wrong, and when the  infringement is particularly serious or the type of case renders civil  enforcement by copyright owners especially difficult. As such, criminal  prosecution has been and is appropriately reserved for serious forms of  large-scale, commercial infringement, not as a means of targeting  ordinary business disputes between legitimate companies or those which  are otherwise adequately addressed through civil litigation. The new  section 2319C, in particular, requires willfulness, which means that  the statute does not apply in the absence of an intentional violation  of a known legal duty.  Consistent with this, a provider of broadband internet access service  would not be subject to prosecution under this statute, for example,  based merely on the attributes or features of its service, nor could  prosecution be predicated on the misuse of its service by its customers  or others in furtherance of an infringement scheme, where the service  provider does not itself share the requisite criminal intent of the  underlying substantive offense and act with specific intent to further  it. In this regard, offering high-speed connections that allow its  customers to access the internet, failing to block or disable access to  particular online locations, or failing to take measures to restrict  the use of or deny its customers access to such service would not be  sufficient to demonstrate the requisite criminal intent under the bill.  This conduct would also not otherwise meet the prerequisites under the  aiding and abetting statute, regardless of whether the broadband  internet access service provider might be civilly liable in such  circumstances under the differing standards for contributory or  vicarious liability.  A person who willfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or  private financial gain offers or provides to the public a digital  transmission service violates the statute under section 2319C(a)(3)  when that person intentionally promotes or directs the promotion of its  use in publicly performing works protected under title 17 without the  authority of the copyright owner or the law. The language of section  2319C makes clear that it is the offering of an illicit digital  transmission service, as defined by section 2319C(a)(1)-(3), that is an  offense, not the marketing activities done by or at the direction of a  person offering an illicit digital transmission service, as referred to  in section 2319C(a)(3). Thus, an entity that provides only commercial  online marketing services and does not itself also provide an illicit  digital transmission service would not be subject to prosecution under  section 2319C(a). Further, it is not the intent of this legislation to  create potential aiding and abetting liability for mainstream third  party ad networks or marketers. An online marketing services provider  could be liable for aiding and abetting an unrelated entity providing  unlawful streaming services only where the online marketing services  provider shared the same requisite criminal intent of each element of  the underlying substantive offense and acted with specific intent to  further it. Thus, an online marketing services provider which places an  advertisement for an entity that is violating section 2319C(a) would  face aiding and abetting liability only if the online marketing  services provider was itself associated with the criminal venture of  the illicit digital transmission service to such an extent that it  shares the criminal intent of the person offering the service and acted  with the requisite specific intent to commit or facilitate the  underlying offense.  Similarly, a service that streams content uploaded by users would not  be subject to prosecution merely because some users might upload  infringing content. The service would be subject to criminal liability  only if it had the requisite criminal intent and acted with specific  intent to further it.  The provisions of this statute also do not apply to any person acting  in good faith and with an objectively reasonable basis in law to  believe that their conduct is lawful. Thus, a bona fide commercial  dispute over the scope or existence of a contract or license governing  such conduct or a good-faith dispute regarding whether a particular  activity is authorized by the Copyright Act would not provide a basis  for prosecution. For example, neither a cloud-based DVR service nor an  application provided by a multichannel video programming distributor,  MVPD, to enable such MVPD's customers to access its video service  utilizing a mobile device, which were the subject of prior civil  copyright infringement challenges based on good faith disagreements  regarding the scope of rights under the Copyright Act, would be  actionable under this provision if the provider offering such services  met this standard. By contrast, a party that merely asserts an  applicable contract, an exception, or a belief that the person's  conduct was lawful, in a case where the assertion is not made in good- faith, is merely a pretense, or is otherwise not based on an  objectively reasonable interpretation of the law, would not avoid  prosecution on that basis.  The statute provides for an enhanced penalty in section 2319C(b)(2)  for someone who knowingly commits an offense in connection with 1 or  more works being prepared for commercial public performance. The  ``should have known'' standard in section 2319C(b)(2) applies only  after a finder of fact determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the  person committed an offense under subsection (a). The ``should have  known'' standard should not be conflated with the standards of  willfulness, not primarily designed, no commercially significant  purpose, and intentionality set forth in section 2319C(a), all of which  define the underlying offense and are intended to protect lawful  internet and streaming services, content licensees, and noncommercial  users.  Finally, the statute in section 2319C(d)(3) defines a work being  prepared for commercial public performance, based on the definition of  ``work being prepared for commercial distribution'' in section  506(a)(3) of the Copyright Act, while updating that definition to  account for the challenges of piracy in the modern streaming  environment. Section 2319C reflects the [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7932\">Page S7932</a>, ] fact that infringement threatens unique harm when it occurs prior to or  in the earliest windows of commercial availability. The definition in  2319C(d)(3) recognizes that in the modem streaming environment, not all  motion pictures are developed for theatrical distribution. The updated  definition of a ``work being prepared for commercial public  performance'' affords appropriately enhanced penalties for violations  of the statute involving pre- and just-released film and television  content, whether in a first theatrical window or immediately upon  release to the public via a streaming or other platform. The  legislation does not make corresponding changes to the definition of  ``work made for commercial distribution'' in section 506(a)(3). Whether  it is appropriate to harmonize the definitions is a question that is  beyond the scope of this particular legislation, which does not  otherwise make changes to title 17. Section 2319C(d)(1) defines  ``motion picture'' as defined in the Copyright Act, which includes  nontheatrical motion pictures, television shows, and broadcasts of live  events.    ", "Ms. MURKOWSKI": " Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this is the time of year when we all  look forward to wrapping things up, as they say.  Many around the country, when they think about wrapping things up,  think about presents that they are going to put under the tree for  their family. We think about it as closing up business for the balance  of the year, and that is really where we are.  Hopefully, in a couple hours here, the House will proceed in taking  up the omnibus bill, along with the COVID relief package, along with a  host of other matters that the Congress has been working to address in  this past year.  I would like to speak this evening for a few moments on the  significance of where we are, but I want to start with just a story  that I just now received from one of my staff people back in Alaska,  and she got a video from the medical staff at the Sub-Regional Clinic  there at St. Mary's. St. Mary's is a small community up on the Yukon  River, and probably, I would say, 500 people, maybe more, in St.  Mary's. But it is just a reminder to me that, regardless of where you  are, hope is coming with the vaccine.  The comment that she shared is this video, a pictorial of the health  aides, the PA--the physician's assistant--and personnel getting their  COVID shots.  It was 13 degrees out. And the mobile office where the vaccine was  administered was inside a chartered Cessna 208 Caravan sitting on the  airport tarmac there in St. Mary's. After the shot, she and her staff  hung out in their heated trucks for about a half an hour to see if they  had any allergic reactions. When none showed signs, the Caravan took  off to the next village airport.  It is just an example that no matter where you are, how remote you  may be, the logistics that may be required to provide for this hope  that comes by way of the vaccine.  People around the country are hopeful. Our job now, as we wrap up, is  to make sure that we deliver this relief quickly.  I mention the COVID relief. I have been fortunate to be teaming with  a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers for the past 5 or 6 weeks to  see if we couldn't come up with a proposal that could kick-start the  COVID talks.  We have had an opportunity for many of us to come to the floor to  speak to not only how that came to be but the ultimate result, which  was a multihundred-page document, legislation, that totaled $908  billion. But it addressed everything from vaccine development and  distribution to what we are going to do to assist our small businesses  with additional rounds of PPP, to extensions to unemployment insurance,  to what we can do with food assistance, nutrition assistance, and what  more might be done to help with rental assistance. It was truly  responsive to the need.  Where we are today is having moved that conversation and that debate  forward, I think, in a constructive, in a positive way. We are here  with a proposal that looks different than what we had produced, but  that is the nature of what happens in a body where you have to come  together to sort out the issues.  And what we will have is legislation that, again, like the CARES Act,  is likely going to be proven imperfect, but we have to respond to the  situation on the ground, whether it is in Alaska or whether it is in  Arkansas, and we cannot do it too soon. So this is going to be key, and  it is going to be critical.  I am very pleased that legislation that I had introduced that would  extend the coronavirus relief funding--the opportunity for States and  localities and Tribal governments to be able to spend those funds down.  Running up against the deadline here of the end of this year was a real  concern for so many, and so that has been included as part of this  bigger package, in addition to so much that is good.  The carrier for all of this is the Omnibus appropriations bill. I  have been really pleased to be a member of the Appropriations  Committee. For some years now, I have been chairing the Appropriations  Interior Subcommittee. This is significant, certainly, for our State,  with oversight of our public lands, and also of Native affairs,  including the EPA. It is a pretty broad portfolio.  We have been working on this dutifully as a subcommittee all year-- all year. I certainly wish that I had had the opportunity to be able to  bring my bill--our bill--to the floor for full debate by all Members,  and then we could move to the Ag bill, to the T-HUD bill, to the  Defense bill--do them all separately.  But for a host of different reasons--most of them all come back to  politics--unfortunately, we have not been able to do that. That is  something that I regret. That is something that I would hope that we,  as Members of the Senate, can say: We can do better.  We pledge to do it better every year. We put our colleagues in a heck  of a spot. Not all of us are on the Appropriations Committee. Not all  of us have the privilege to be a chairman or a ranking member and know  the guts and the insides of each aspect of these bills.  But we come here with a process like this at a late hour, and we say:  This is one where you need to know that we have been working it hard.  We have taken into account all the priorities and considerations on  both sides. We worked it back and forth. We worked it with the House,  and here we are. But this is not a good process. We can and we must do  better with that.  Now, having said that, I am very proud of the Interior bill that we  have built. I am proud of my staff. We were a little bit leaner this  year in terms of our staffing, but with good leadership, led by Emy  Lesofski and Nona, as well as Lucas on the team, we were able to do the  work that we needed to do and in a way that I am proud of and proud of  their efforts.  There is so much that is wrapped up in this bigger, broader bill, and  I think it is going to almost be gaspworthy when you see the 5,000- some-odd pages I am told that we will have.  It is not only the appropriations. It is the COVID bills. It is the  water resources development bill, the WRDA bill--very, very  significant. There are good bills from the Indian Affairs Committee  that I have participated in, water bills that we have been working on.  But the one that I want to speak to a little more in detail this  evening--and I was hoping that my ranking member, Senator Manchin,  might be here on the floor, but not yet--but I wanted to speak about  title Z in the omnibus bill.  Z, I just imagine that they put it at the end because they figured it  was the best or maybe because they knew that the process that the  Energy Act had gone through had probably been more rigorous and lengthy  than just about anything out there. But Z we are at.  I begin my comments with regard to this Energy Act that is contained  in this bill by acknowledging that I am probably speaking on the floor  for the last time as the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources  Committee because I have hit my limit, if you will. I have had the  honor and the privilege to be both the chairman and the ranking member  on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee now for a total of 12  years, which is pretty good.  It is pretty good to be in a position to be able to advance  legislative policy. I have been very, very fortunate to work with great  members. Senator Bingaman was the chairman when I was his ranking and,  of course, I was with Senator Wyden as the ranking member when he was  chairman. I have had the great privilege to work with Senator Cantwell  when I was the chairman and now Senator Manchin. I think about these  past 2 years and what we have been able to accomplish and just kind of  the recap of where we have been and how productive we have been as a  panel. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7909\">Page S7909</a>, ]  We started this Congress with passage of the John D. Dingell, Jr.,  Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act. This is a bipartisan  package of more than 120 different measures focused on public lands,  natural resources, and water.  We had worked on a lands package throughout the last several months  of 2018. I want to give former Ranking Member Cantwell a real big  shout-out here because her leadership was very key in that process. We  weren't able to get it across the finish line at the end of the last  Congress, but we reintroduced it in January of 2019. We passed it  through the Senate in February, and the President signed it into law in  March. That was a pretty good start--120 bipartisan bills.  These were bills, when you think about it, that related to national  parks, to forests, to sportsmen's access. We delivered on the Federal  Government's promises to Alaska Natives who served during the Vietnam  war. We permanently reauthorized the Land and Water Conservation Fund,  and we provided new authorities to help protect from natural hazards  such as volcanic eruptions. I will note that the Kilauea just erupted  on the Big Island of Hawaii. I believe it was yesterday or the day  before. So it is important to be addressing our natural hazards.  We did that at the beginning of the Congress. Then Senator Manchin  and I set our sights on something that hadn't been done in a long time,  and that was modernization of our Nation's energy policies to make real  reforms and bring them in line with our current challenges and our  opportunities. So we started with some very broad--very broad-based-- hearings and then took a very specific and deep dive into some of the  issues and the technologies.  Then we started moving bills. We were negotiating and we were  reporting dozens of bills as part of our regular order committee  process. Knowing how things work around here, we knew we weren't going  to be able to move them each individually as stand-alone bills, so we  wrapped them up into a broader bill. We called it the American Energy  Innovation Act.  We brought that bill to the floor in February. We were going just  great. We were working through, and it was kind of nice, again, to be  the first bill on the floor when we began our legislative business. And  we stalled out. We were interrupted. We were taken off the track by an  unrelated dispute over a measure that is jurisdictional to another  committee, and this was just at the start of the global coronavirus  pandemic.  But I said: We are not done. We are not stopping just because we hit  a roadblock here. We are going to keep working.  We kept working. We kept working, and we kept looking for a way to  pass the first major Energy bill since 2007--and 2007 is a long time  that we hadn't updated and reworked our energy policy, so it was worth  working on. I kept saying: Don't count us out. Don't write us off.  Over the past few months, we found that opening. We worked with  really good partners over on the House side over at Energy and Commerce  and the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and we wrote  what we have called simply the Energy Act of 2020--pretty simple,  pretty beautiful, in my opinion.  But our Energy Act is included now as division Z in the year-end  omnibus. It provides for reforms and new authorities related to a range  of emerging technologies, including advanced nuclear; carbon capture,  utilization, and storage; carbon removal; renewables; and energy  storage. It reauthorizes programs that many of us are supportive of and  want to advance: Weatherization Assistance and ARPA-E. It features the  bulk of my language related to critical minerals and materials to help  us rebuild our domestic supply chains, which we know are so critical.  It reflects our strong commitment to cleaner energy to help us address  climate change without raising the cost of energy or imposing divisive  mandates.  So I would suggest to the Presiding Officer that this Energy bill is  just the perfect bookend for this Congress. What started as a major  lands package is now going to end with a major energy package. Again,  as I mentioned, it has been since 2007. It is the first Energy bill-- the energy side of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee--the  first Energy bill in almost 13 years. It was President George W. Bush  who signed the last one on December 19, 2007.  So I want to thank Ranking Member Manchin for his leadership on the  energy package, as well as all of the committee members who contributed  to it. We had great help within our committee. We had great help within  this body. At last count we were looking at input and contributions  from some 70 different Members.  I also want to acknowledge the extraordinary work of the staffs. I  had the opportunity to give a tribute to my staff director, Brian  Hughes, who is leaving after many years on the committee. He did a  fabulous job of advancing this, as did Spencer Nelson, Pat McCormick,  Annie Hoefler, Lucy Murfitt. There were so many others. That team was  extraordinary.  But they were joined by an extraordinary team that Senator Manchin  had, led by his staff director, Renae Black, and other individuals  there who really helped us advance this--Sam Fowler and so many. We  can't thank them enough.  I also want to really give sincere thanks to our House partners  because they were this ``six corner'' working group here: Frank  Pallone, the chairman at Energy and Commerce and the ranking member,  Greg Walden; the Science chairwoman, Bernice Johnson, and the ranking  member, Frank Lucas. We could not have reached an agreement without  their leadership and their willingness to work together.  I also want to acknowledge and thank Leader McConnell and Senator  Schumer for agreeing to work with us and help us secure this opening  and this commitment.  I can't remember how many times Leader McConnell had said: You know,  Lisa, you are probably going to figure out a way to pull a rabbit out  of the hat here. And I don't know if this is a rabbit out of the hat,  but I think persistence certainly has paid off. So I want to thank the  teams who really helped to make this happen.  In addition to a good energy bill, the year-end omnibus also includes  the bipartisan water package featuring nine provisions that are  important to Western States, such as Colorado, Montana, and Arizona.  Lane Dickson on my Energy Committee staff was fabulous there. We added  a few more lands bills into the final package. Lucy and Annie helped us  on that. We really have worked to advance so much out of the committee.  All of these accomplishments--our lands package, our energy package,  our water package, the lands bills that we tried to add to everything  that moved and occasionally passed by UC, and measures I haven't spoken  to, including the Great American Outdoors Act--these are all the  hallmarks of a highly productive Congress and the Senate Energy and  Natural Resources Committee. I am pleased to have been able to shepherd  these measures into law.  But what I am proud of--more than any piece of legislation, more than  anything out there in the time that I have been able to lead this  committee, what I am most proud of is the bipartisan way in which this  committee has operated. Our commitment to bipartisanship has produced  continually good results for our country.  What I found as ranking member and now as chairman is that there is  simply no substitute for working together and across party lines to  find agreement wherever it is possible.  So I thank Senator Manchin for following that same approach, to our  committee colleagues for their own bipartisanship and collegiality, to  our House colleagues who have helped us with that.  I see that my friend from the great State of Washington and Pacific  Northwest is here, and I want Senator Cantwell to know that as I have  spoken of the accomplishments of the Energy and Natural Resources  Committee, I am very thankful and appreciative of her leadership and  what she has provided over the years. Working together with her team,  we have accomplished good things for the right reasons.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mrs. SHAHEEN": " Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Warren and Jane Allen of Spofford, NH. The couple served our country with distinction during World War II, and the life they built together is emblematic of the many who came home from war, raised a family, and helped to build the America we know today. Warren, or ``Bill'' as he is known to close friends, was born on March 14, 1923, in Calhoun, GA. He joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1942. When asked years later why he decided to enlist, he replied that he saw a movie about the Marines and liked the look of their dress blues. His service brought him across the country, from boot camp at Parris Island in South Carolina to ``tower school'' in Fort Worth, TX, and eventually to a posting at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in Havelock, NC. An air traffic controller, Bill remembers having to stand on orange crates to direct aircraft traffic at MCAS Cherry Point. The control tower had not been built yet. Jane Post was born on April 26, 1923, in Spofford, NH. She enlisted in the recently formed U.S. Marine Corps Women Reserves in June of 1943. She trained at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and attended control tower school in Atlanta, GA. Following her training, she arrived at MCAS Cherry Point and was assigned to the air station's clearance center. It was her responsibility to keep track of all arriving and departing aircraft at the station. It was at Cherry Point that Jane's path crossed Bill's in 1943. By November of that year, Bill had risen to a supervisor position at air station. One day, a plane carrying a U.S. Marine Corps general was descending and given clearance to land. Suddenly, a fighter pilot radioed that his plane was losing air pressure and requested permission for an emergency landing. The control tower instructed the fighter pilot to circle the air station and allow the general's plane to land first. Upon hearing this, Bill sprinted up the stairs of the control tower and demanded to know who gave those instructions. It was Jane Post. Though he disagreed with her judgement on which plane should have landed first that day, Bill struck up a relationship with that control tower operator. They were married 5 months later on April 20, 1944, and have been inseparable ever since. Bill continued to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps until 1946. He reenlisted in 1947 and kept his rank of technical sergeant. In 1952, he was honorably discharged from the Reserves. Jane served in the Women Reserves until January 12, 1945. She was honorably discharged upon the news that she and Bill were expecting their first child. The Allens eventually settled in Spofford, NH, a small community in the western part of the State. Bill went on to work at a number of local banks after a short stint as the owner of the local Tuttle's Store. He retired as president of the Savings Bank of Walpole in 1993. As their children grew up, Jane returned to school and obtained a bachelor's degree in home economics from nearby Keene State College. They also applied the leadership qualities that they refined in the Marine Corps to a variety of community endeavors. Bill served as town moderator and a longtime member of the local budget committee. He was also a captain at the Spofford Volunteer Fire Department. Jane worked to establish the Chesterfield Historical Society and was a driving force in raising funds for a new library in town. Bill and Jane were both fixtures at Keene State College basketball games, Bill as an official scorekeeper and Jane as a dedicated fan. Last year, they celebrated their diamond wedding anniversary among family and the many friends they have made in their journey from Cherry Point to the Granite State. On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in thanking Bill and Jane Allen for their service in World War II and the many contributions they have made to their community in the years since. We wish them all the best in the years ahead.<bullet>   ", "Mr. YOUNG": " Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Shepherd Community  Center's 35 years of service to individuals and families on the near  eastside of Indianapolis, IN. Since 1985, this faith-based, inner-city  ministry has operated with the mission to ``break the cycle of poverty  on the near Eastside of Indianapolis by engaging and empowering the  community to cultivate healthy children, strong families, and vibrant  neighborhoods through a Christ-centered approach that meets the  physical, emotional, spiritual, and academic needs of our neighbors.''  Shepherd Community Center serves the near Eastside of Indianapolis,  where poverty rates in the area reach as high as 38.6 percent and 8 of  10 children rely on school as their primary source of food during the  week. Shepherd provides hope and support to its neighbors through a  unique and holistic approach Shepherd calls its Continuum of Care. The  Continuum of Care is a full set of programs that allows Shepherd to be  continuously engaged in the lives of neighborhood children, teens, and  their parents. It is designed to help area families overcome the  challenges they may be facing in all areas: physical, emotional,  spiritual, and academic.  Shepherd's approach has consistently yielded positive results, and  families in its programs have become stronger physically, emotionally,  spiritually, and financially. Shepherd's students also attain higher  academic achievement. In an area where only 33 percent of entering  freshmen graduate high school and only 75 percent of those who graduate  go on to college, nearly 90 percent of Shepherd's seniors graduate and  go on to college, job training, or the military.  Shepherd's history dates to the fall of 1984, when the Westside  Church of the Nazarene sent a group of volunteers to Central Nazarene  Church to serve a Thanksgiving meal. In February 1985, that simple meal  blossomed into an organization: Central Nazarene Mission. A few years  later, the name was changed to Shepherd Community Center. Reverend Dean  Cowles was the founding director and served in that role for Shepherd's  first 4 years. Reverend John Hay, Jr. served for the next few years.  Following Hay's departure, Cowles returned and served yet another 4  years. After a few years of transition, Reverend Jay Height was named  executive director in 1998 and continues to serve today.  And my friend Reverend Height has been a tireless champion for  families on the near Eastside every day since then. In a 35th  anniversary year when the COVID-19 pandemic compounded the challenges  facing families in the area, Reverend Height and the Shepherd Community  team met those challenges head on, and arm-in-arm with their neighbors.  In a recent article in the Indianapolis Star, Reverend Height said,  ``Hope is a precious commodity. When it's lost, the consequences for  human life are devastating.''  I agree, Reverend Height. And I know the countless families of  Indianapolis that Shepherd has served in its first 35 years are  eternally grateful that Shepherd has been a custodian of hope for our  capital city. On behalf of those families and the State of Indiana, I  congratulate you on the 35th anniversary of Shepherd Community Center,  I thank everyone who has worked and sacrificed in order to bless their  neighborhoods through the work of Shepherd and wish the Shepherd  Community Center all the best as it carries on that good and crucial  work.    ", "Mr. MORAN": " Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I rise out of respect and in memory of Gove  County Sheriff Allan Weber, who served his community faithfully over  the last two decades.  Allan was born and raised on his family's farm near Park, KS, and he  went on to marry Connie, his high school sweetheart. The couple has  three children--Andrea, Brandon, and Cory. To those who know Allan, it  was always clear that his family meant everything to him. His many  grandchildren were his pride and joy.  In 1996, he ran for Gove County sheriff and served his community  faithfully for over two decades since first elected. Gove County is out  in Western Kansas. It is flat. It is the prairie. It is windy. It is  hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It is farmers and ranchers.  It is often a struggle to earn a living in Gove County. I know the  county well. Despite those challenges, it is made up of people who work  hard, care for each other, and try to make good lives for themselves  and their families.  In rural areas like Gove County, the sheriff oftentimes wears  multiple hats, and Sheriff Weber was no different. In addition to  serving as sheriff, he was also the public information officer and the  emergency operations center community liaison.  Kansans also never fail to step up to help their neighbors in hard  times, and Allan did the same. After the tragic death of a neighboring  county's sheriff, he stepped up to serve as the interim sheriff in  Sheridan County, making him the first person ever to serve two counties  as sheriff at the same time--a first in Kansas's history. He saw his  brothers and sisters in blue as an extended part of his family, and he  held them in the highest regard.  His colleague in law enforcement, Sheriff Tim Morse of Jackson  County, which is on the other side of the State, wrote this:  Kansas has lost a great sheriff. Gove County Sheriff Allan   Weber has spent the last couple of months fighting COVID-19   in a Denver hospital. Today, Sheriff Weber was escorted back   to Gove County by Colorado and Kansas Highway Patrols along   with countless Kansas Sheriffs and law enforcement officers   for one last time . . . Sheriff Weber was an honorable man   who was respected by all. He will be greatly missed.  He respected those in blue, and those in blue respected him.  He was a dedicated public servant both in his home community and at  the State level. He served the Kansas Sheriffs' Association on its  board and as its president. I talked to the Kansas Sheriffs'  Association today, and they wanted me to recognize Sheriff Weber's  professionalism and his dedication and that he served as president of  the Association for two consecutive terms, which is a rare circumstance  and speaks to his effectiveness in the role and the admiration that his  colleagues held for him.  His community also loved and respected him. They came together to  welcome him home one last time with an honor parade down Highway 212,  in Quinter, this past Saturday night, with hundreds of cars and people  lined up to recognize his service and sacrifice over a lifetime.  Connie, his wife, said:  It was such a beautiful homecoming. I know he was bursting   with pride and love. After the November election, when he   woke up in the intensive care unit, I told him he was sheriff   for the next 4 years, and he gave me a small smile and nodded   his head. He loved the Gove County community's mind and was   always ready to give the ultimate sacrifice if he had to.   There were times that his heart broke doing his job, but he   did what was right. He lived life day-to-day and enjoyed it   and everyone. He worked hard and loved gently. He will be   missed by many.  The outpouring of love, support, and shared memories on their Quinter  Community Facebook page has been constant and speaks to the  interconnectedness of a small community.  I should tell you that the population of Gove County is about 2,612,  and the county seat of Gove has a population of 70. It is in places  like Quinter, like Gove, and like Gove County where the sheriff is  known by everyone, and the sheriff is interwoven into the life of the  community and the county.  So many of his friends and family have remarked on Allan's contagious  smile, how ornery he was, but, most importantly, as to the selfless way  he served people. Those of us in public service ought to look to Allan  as a role model in that selfless service of others. Sheriff Allan Weber  embodied so many values in Kansas--faith, family, fellowship, service,  and good old-fashioned hard work. He will be missed by many.  Robba and I extend our deepest sympathies to his family--both his  loved ones, which includes one of my staff members, Chelsey Ladd, his  cousin, and his brothers and sisters in blue.  May God bless Allan Weber. May we praise him for the life he lived,  and may we look to him as a role model to try to do what he has done.  I offer my condolences and respect, on behalf of the U.S. Senate, to  the family of Sheriff Allan Weber.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. CRAWLEY": " Mr. CRAWLEY. Mr. President, it is no secret around here that staff  work is key to any Senator's success. It often goes unnoticed and  unthanked, but today, as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement  Implementation Act passes Congress, I would like to express my  appreciation to the many Senate staff who work for the people of Iowa  and the entire country.  Foremost among them are Kolan Davis, my Finance Committee staff  director and longtime advisor of 35 years; Jeff Wrase, my deputy staff  director; and Nasim Fussell, my chief international trade counsel on  the committee. Their thoughtful, prudent advice, and hard work were  crucial to helping create the conditions that allow for nearly- unanimous passage today.  Nasim led my trade staff on the Finance Committee. Her leadership of  several other key staff, including Mayur Patel, Brian Bombassaro,  Andrew Brandt, Rory Heslington, Grace Kim, and Michael Pinkerton, and  all of their many late nights working at the office, are among the top  reasons why this modernized trade agreement wasn't just negotiated with  Canada and Mexico but will actually become law and soon take effect.  Their diligent work with their Democratic counterparts, as well as the  administration, is evidenced in the overwhelming vote USMCA received.  My chief of staff, Aaron Cummings, legislative director, James Rice,  and director of scheduling, Jennifer Heins, provided consistent  guidance and helpful input on USMCA throughout negotiations that helped  me do the job I needed to do for us to get to this point. I am grateful  for their standing by my side this past year and going above and beyond  for the people of Iowa.  I would also like to thank my communications and press staff,  including Michael Zona, Taylor Foy, George Hartmann, Nicole Tieman,  Melissa Kearney, and Katelyn Schultz, for helping me communicate the  many benefits of this trade deal to Iowans and all Americans. Their  work to deliver that message to the grassroots of this country helped  create the public pressure needed to encourage Congress to act and  ratify USMCA.  We all know that no legislating happens in the Senate without  bipartisanship. That is why today I say congratulations and thank you  to Ranking Member Wyden and his staff for all their hard work. They are  Joshua Sheinkman, staff director; Mike Evans, deputy staff director;  Jayme White, chief advisor on international competitiveness and  innovation; and Greta Peisch, Sally Laing, Virginia Lenahan, and Rachel  Lang.  Of course, also critical to the bill's passage were Ambassador Bob  Lighthizer and his hard-working team at the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative, particularly John Melle and Maria Pagan.  Getting the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO to both endorse this  trade deal was no easy feat, and it took both sides' good faith efforts  to get us here.  You have heard me extol all the good that USMCA will do for this  Nation's [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S263\">Page S263</a>, ] farmers, ranchers, manufacturers and workers of all stripes--hundreds  of thousands jobs, billions of dollars added to the economy, new market  access, and a framework for the future of international trade. It is  these staff members who also deserve to share in the Nation's gratitude  and celebration.  Thank you all.    ", "Mrs. FEINSTEIN": " Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Senator Lamar  Alexander, a friend and a colleague who has served in this body for  some 18 years now. I have had the pleasure of serving with this Senator  on both the Rules Committee and the Appropriations Committee, and we  sat next to each other as chairman or ranking member on two  Appropriations subcommittees--first Interior and then Energy and Water.  We have done that since 2009. It has been through these experiences  that I truly have come to appreciate Senator Alexander's fairness, his  interest in solving problems, and his bipartisanship.  Most of all, I so appreciate your friendship and the time we have had  to talk together.  I do believe that the Senate is going to be diminished by the absence  of this Senator. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7149\">Page S7149</a>, ]  Working closely as chair and ranking member of the Energy and Water  Development Subcommittee, we have always been able to find agreement on  the annual appropriations bill. That is because we shared a willingness  to find common ground. And that is no small thing. We have consistently  held comprehensive subcommittee hearings on a wide range of issues,  from nuclear power and nuclear waste to dam safety, to devastating  droughts in the West and the future of renewable energy.  We were also often among the first, if not the first subcommittee to  negotiate our bill, draft it, and get it marked up by the full  committee, and that includes 4 years of record-level funding for clean  energy, the National Laboratories, supercomputing, and water projects.  The focus has always been on a fair, open process that seeks  compromise. And that track record speaks to the value we place on the  process.  But more than anything, Senator Alexander will be remembered as  someone who dedicated his life to serving the people of Tennessee.  Between his 8 years as Governor and 16 years as a Senator, he served  longer than any Tennessean who has held both jobs. That doesn't include  the 2 years he served as President George H.W. Bush's Secretary of  Education.  His priorities have always been of great importance to Tennessee,  whether Army Corps of Engineers funding for inland waters, particularly  his favorite, Chickamauga--this is the first time I ever heard the word  pronounced--Chickamauga Lock, which he often talks about in our  hearings, or updating the way musicians are paid for their work.  He also led efforts to pass the Every Student Succeeds Act in 2015,  which President Obama called a ``Christmas miracle.''  As we hear promising news about coronavirus vaccines, we are reminded  of the 21st Century Cures Act. That is Senator Alexander's landmark  2016 bill that streamlined the drug and device approval process to  bring treatments to market faster. He has a long record of work he can  be proud of.  Lamar, you have been a great colleague and a dear friend all these  years in the Senate. I am proud of what we have achieved together. I  will miss our dinners together and sitting next to you on the dais. I  hope you enjoy a well-earned retirement with Honey and your beautiful  family. Thank you so much for your service    ", "Ms. HASSAN": " Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the career of New Hampshire State Trooper Scott Frye, who recently retired from the force. A native of Milford, NH, Scott served with the New Hampshire State Police for more than 22 years as a road trooper, a member of the narcotics unit, and most recently as head of the executive protection detail. During his time in executive protection, Scott served under three Governors, including for 4 years during my time as Governor. Through our work together, I saw firsthand Scott's commitment to the Granite State. He always sees the big picture; he can step into a room and immediately assess it and the people in it, both as a security risk, but also for need. Scott can find a way to connect with and put almost anyone at ease. As a result, he is greeted as a welcome friend wherever he goes in New Hampshire. While Scott served for nearly a dozen years on the security detail of Governors, he never lost sight of his commitment and obligation to protect the safety of every person in New Hampshire. Scott's experience and deep understanding of the Granite State were an important benefit to those he worked with. When we would travel to sites of natural disasters during my time as Governor, Scott always had a sense about who needed to be checked in with and what a community or a public safety official needed in challenging times. Even when his day ended and he was officially off-duty, if he were on his way home and an extra State trooper was needed, he would be there to help in any way that he could. Perhaps nothing exemplifies Scott's dedication, bravery, and heroism more than when he was driving Governor John Lynch in 2012 and they witnessed an accident. A car had gone through a guardrail, fallen into an embankment, and caught fire. Scott pulled over, and along with an off-duty firefighter, freed a man who was trapped in the vehicle--just seconds before it was engulfed in flames. For his lifesaving action, Scott was honored with a number of awards, including a Carnegie Medal, a national honor that recognizes those who risk their lives to an extraordinary degree while saving or attempting to save the lives of others. Throughout his service, Scott approached everything with humor, kindness, and patience. He never complained, and he always served with an incredible amount of professionalism. Above all, Scott's main commitment was to his family. His service would not have been possible without the support and love of his wife Susan, his sons Zachary and Matthew, and his extended family. I am grateful for Scott's friendship and his years of dedication to the people of New Hampshire. His retirement is well-deserved, and I know that he will continue to look for ways to improve his community and the entire Granite State. I hope that you will join me in recognizing the years of service of State Trooper Scott Frye.<bullet>   ", "Mr. SCHIFF": " Mr. SCHIFF. Timing is really driven by the urgency.    ", "Ms. WILLIAMS": " Ms. WILLIAMS. I believe that is what President Zelensky was   indicating, that any signal or sign that U.S. support was   wavering would be construed by Russia as potentially an   opportunity for them to strengthen their own hand in Ukraine.  Mr. Manager CROW. This is an important point, particularly when the  President and his attorneys tried to argue: no harm, no foul.  The financial assistance itself was really important to Ukraine, no  question about it. But the aid was equally important as a signal to  Russia of our support for Ukraine. And regardless of whether the aid  was ultimately released, the fact that the hold became public sent a  very clear signal to Russia that our support for Ukraine was wavering,  and Russia was watching very closely for any sign of weakness. The  damage was done.  Now, any possible doubt about whether the aid was linked to the  investigations has been erased by the President's own Chief of Staff.  We have seen this video before during the trial, but there is a really  good reason for this. It is a complete admission on national TV that  the military aid was conditioned on Ukraine helping the President's  political campaign.  Here, once again, is what Mulvaney said.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)    ", "Ms. HILL": " Ms. HILL. Based on questions and statements I have heard,   some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia   and its security services did not conduct a campaign against   our country and that perhaps, somehow for some reason,   Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative being perpetrated   and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.  The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power   that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in   2016. This is the public conclusion of our intelligence   agencies confirmed in bipartisan and congressional reports.   It is beyond dispute, even if some of the underlying details   must remain classified.  The impacts of the successful 2016 Russian campaign remain   evident today. Our Nation is being torn apart. The truth is   questioned. Our highly professional, expert career Foreign   Service is being undermined. U.S. support for Ukraine which   continues to face armed Russian aggression is being   politicized. The Russian Government's goal is to weaken our   country, to diminish America's global role, and to neutralize   a perceived U.S. threat to Russian interests.  Mr. Manager NADLER. President Trump knew this too. His former  Homeland Security Advisor, Tom Bossert, said that the idea that Ukraine  hacked the DNC server was ``not only a conspiracy theory, it is  completely debunked,'' and he and other U.S. officials spent hours with  the President explaining why.  The second false allegation that the President wanted the Ukrainians  to announce was that Vice President Biden used his power to protect a  company on whose board his son sat by forcing the removal of Viktor  Shokin, the corrupt former prosecutor general.  It is true that Vice President Biden helped remove Mr. Shokin, who  was widely believed to be corrupt. As I said a few minutes ago, it was  official policy of the United States, the European community, and  others, in order to fight corruption in Ukraine, to ask that Shokin and  Lutsenko be removed. So the Vice President, Vice President Biden, in  fulfilling U.S. policy, pressured Ukraine to remove Shokin--not to  secure some personal benefit but to advance the official policy of the  United States and its allies. Even Lutsenko, who initially seeded the  allegations against Mr. Biden in American media, later admitted that  the allegations against the Vice President were false. And Rudy  Giuliani told Kurt Volker, the Special Representative for Ukrainian  Negotiations, who had a prominent role in the scheme, that he also knew  the attacks on Joe Biden were a lie.  With Ambassador Yovanovitch out of the way, the first chapter of the  Ukraine scheme was complete. Mr. Giuliani and his agents could now  apply direct pressure to the Ukrainian Government to spread these two  falsehoods.  Who benefited from this scheme? Who sent Mr. Giuliani to Ukraine in  the first place? Of course we could rephrase that question as the  former Republican leader of the Senate, Howard Baker, asked it in 1973:  What did the President know, and when he did he know it?  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, President's  counsel: President Trump and President Zelensky's relationship started  out well. President Trump wanted the two investigations from Zelensky,  and he had no reason to believe he would not get what he wanted.  On April 21, 2019, Volodymyr Zelensky, who was new to politics, won a  landslide victory in Ukraine's Presidential election. That evening,  President Trump called Zelensky to congratulate him. On that first  call--the first call--Zelensky invited President Trump to visit Ukraine  for the upcoming inauguration. President Trump, in turn, promised that  his administration would send someone at ``a very, very high level.''  During that same April call, President Trump invited President  Zelensky to the White House, saying:  When you're settled in and ready, I'd like to invite you to   the White House. We'll have a lot of things to talk about,   but we're with you all the way.  Zelensky immediately accepted the President's invitation, adding that  the ``whole team and I are looking forward to that visit.''  Numerous witnesses testified about the significance of a White House  meeting for the political newcomer. A White House meeting would show  Ukrainians that America supported Zelensky's anti-corruption platform.  The clear backing of the President of the United States--Ukraine's most  important patron--would also send a powerful message to Russia that we  had Ukraine's back.  During that April 21 call, President Trump never even uttered the  word ``corruption,'' but the official White House call recap falsely  stated that the two Presidents had discussed Ukraine's anti-corruption  efforts.  Shortly after the phone call, Jennifer Williams, adviser to Vice  President Pence, learned that President Trump asked Vice President  Pence to attend Zelensky's inauguration.  Williams and her colleagues began planning Pence's trip to Kyiv. At  the same time, Giuliani was trying to get Ukraine to investigate the  Bidens and alleged 2016 election interference. On April 24, Giuliani  went on ``FOX & Friends'' and had this to say:  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Keep your eye on Ukraine, because in Ukraine a lot of dirty   work was done. I'm digging up the information. American   officials were used. Ukrainian officials were used. That is   like collusion with the Ukrainians and--or actually, in this   case, conspiracy with the Ukrainians. I think you'd get some   interesting information about Joe Biden from Ukraine. About   his son, Hunter Biden. About a company he was on the board of   for years, which may be one of the most crooked companies in   Ukraine.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. For this campaign to be truly beneficial  to his boss President Trump, Giuliani needed access to the new  government in Ukraine. He dispatched his associates Lev Parnas and Igor  Fruman to try to make inroads with Zelensky's team.  On April 25, former Vice President Biden publicly announced his bid  for Presidency, and immediately he was at the top of the polls.  That same day, David Holmes, an American diplomat at our Embassy in  Ukraine, learned that Giuliani had reached out to the head of President  Zelensky's campaign. As Mr. Holmes explained, the new Ukrainian  Government began to think that Giuliani [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S460\">Page S460</a>, ] ``was a significant person in terms of managing their relationship with  the United States.''  As Giuliani and his associates worked behind the scenes to get access  to the new leadership in Ukraine, President Trump was publicly  signaling his interest in the investigations. On May 2, the President  appeared on FOX News. When asked, ``Should the former vice president  explain himself on his feeling in Ukraine and whether there was a  conflict . . . with his son's business interests?'' President Trump  replied as follows:  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  I'm hearing it's a major scandal, major problem. Very bad   things happened, and we'll see what that is. They even have   him on tape, talking about it. They have Joe Biden on tape   talking about the prosecutor. And I've seen that tape. A lot   of people are talking about that tape, but that's up to them.   They have to solve that problem.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. The tape President Trump referenced is a  video from January 2018 in which Vice President Biden explained that he  placed an ultimatum to the Ukrainian President to remove the corrupt  prosecutor general to ensure that taxpayer money would be used  appropriately. The Vice President's actions were consistent with  official U.S. policy as well as the opinions of the international  community.  On May 9, the New York Times published an article about Giuliani's  plan to visit Ukraine. In the article, Giuliani confirmed that he  planned to meet with Zelensky. At that meeting, he wanted to press the  Ukrainian Government to pursue the investigations that President Trump  promoted only days earlier. Giuliani said: ``We're not meddling in an  election, we are meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to  do.''  Giuliani even went so far as to acknowledge that his actions could  benefit President Trump personally. He said: ``[T]his isn't foreign  policy--I'm asking them to do an investigation that they're doing  already and that other people are telling them to stop. And I am going  to give them reasons why they shouldn't stop it because that  information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out  to be helpful to my government.''  That is it right there--Giuliani admitting he was asking Ukraine to  work an investigation that would be ``very, very helpful'' to the  President. He was not doing foreign policy. He was not doing this on  behalf of the government. He was doing this for the personal interests  of his client, Donald J. Trump.  The next morning, on May 10, amid coverage of his planned trip to  Ukraine, Giuliani tweeted further about Biden and then had a flurry of  calls with Parnas, who was helping in planning his trip to Ukraine.  That same day, Giuliani also spoke with Ambassador Volker on the  phone for more than 30 minutes. Ambassador Volker had learned that  Giuliani had intended to travel to Ukraine and had called to warn  Giuliani that Prosecutor General Lutsenko ``is not credible. Don't  listen to what he is saying.''  Later that day, Giuliani had a 17-minute call with a masked White  House number before speaking again with Parnas for 12 minutes.  That same day, on May 10, Politico asked President Trump about  Giuliani's upcoming trip, and he replied, ``I have not spoken to him at  any great length, but I will. . . . I will speak to him about it before  he leaves.'' But that evening, on FOX News, Giuliani announced: ``I'm  not going to go'' to Ukraine ``because I think I'm walking into a group  of people that are enemies of the President.'' Separately, in a text  message to ``Politico,'' Giuliani alleged that the original offer for a  meeting with Zelensky was a ``set-up.'' He said it was a set-up  orchestrated by ``several vocal critics'' of President Trump who were  advising Zelensky. Giuliani declared that ``Zelensky is in [the] hands  of avowed enemies of President Trump.''  But Giuliani had not stopped trying. He had Parnas send a letter to  Zelensky's senior aide on May 11 asking for a meeting. That letter made  it clear that Giuliani was representing President Trump as ``a private  citizen'' and that he was working with President Trump's ``knowledge  and consent.''  The letter is on the slide. It reads:  In my capacity as personal counsel to President Trump and   with his knowledge and consent, I request a meeting with you   on this upcoming Monday, May 13, or Tuesday, May 14. I will   need no more than a half-hour of your time and I will be   accompanied by my colleague Victoria Toensing, a   distinguished American attorney who is very familiar with the   matter.  But it did not appear that Giuliani and Parnas's attempts to get the  meeting were working. That same day, Giuliani sent a text message to  Parnas asking, ``This guy is canceling meeting, I think?''  Approximately 3 hours later, Giuliani sent Parnas drafts of a public  statement that ``people advising the PRES ELECT are no friends of the  President.''  Three days later, President Trump instructed Vice President Pence not  to attend the inauguration in Ukraine--just 3 days later. Vice  Presidential staffer Jennifer Williams received a surprising call from  Pence's Chief of Staff. She described it during her public testimony.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  On May 13th, an assistant to the Vice President's chief of   staff called and informed me that President Trump had decided   that the Vice President would not attend the inauguration in   Ukraine. She did not provide any further explanation. I   relayed that instruction to others involved in planning the   potential trip. I also informed the NSC that the Vice   President would not be attending, so that it could identify a   head of delegation to represent the United States at   President-elect Zelensky's inauguration.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Notably, Williams confirmed that the  inauguration date had not yet been scheduled at the time of that phone  call. So the reason for President Trump's decision was certainly not  due to a scheduling conflict.  Secretary of Energy Rick Perry ultimately led the delegation to the  inaugural. Accompanying Secretary Perry were Ambassador to the European  Union, Gordon Sondland; Ambassador Volker; NSC Director for Ukraine,  LTC Alexander Vindman; and Senator Ron Johnson also attended many of  the inaugural events with the delegation. When asked if this delegation  was a good group, Holmes replied that it ``was not as senior a  delegation as we might have expected.''  After the inauguration, Ambassadors Volker and Sondland left Kyiv  with a very favorable impression of President Zelensky. Ambassador  Volker said they believed it was important that President Trump  personally engage with the President of Ukraine in order to demonstrate  full U.S. support for him.  When the inauguration team returned to the United States, they had a  meeting with President Trump on May 23. The May 23 meeting with  President Trump proved to be important for two good reasons. First,  with Ambassador Yovanovitch out of the way, President Trump authorized  Ambassador Sondland, Secretary Perry, and Ambassador Volker to lead  engagement with the new administration in Ukraine; and two, President  Trump instructed them to satisfy Giuliani's concerns in order to move  forward on Ukraine matters.  These officials were all political appointees, and Ambassador  Sondland had donated $1 million to the President's inauguration. The  President saw these three political appointees as officials who would  fulfill his requests.  Ambassador Volker testified that he, Ambassador Sondland, Secretary  Perry, and Senator Johnson took turns making their case that this is a  new crowd. It is a new President in Ukraine. He is committed to doing  the right things, including fighting corruption. They recommended that  President Trump follow through on his invitation for President Zelensky  to meet with him in the Oval Office, but President Trump did not  receive the recommendation well.  At his public hearing, Ambassador Volker described the May 23 Oval  Office meeting with President Trump. Let's listen.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador VOLKER. We stressed our finding that President   Zelensky represented the best chance for getting Ukraine out   of the mire of corruption it had been in for over 20 years.   We urged him [President Trump] to invite President Zelensky   to the White House. The President was very skeptical. Given   Ukraine's history of corruption, that's understandable. He   said that Ukraine was a corrupt country, full of terrible   people. He said, ``They tried to take me down.'' In the   course of that conversation, he referenced conversations with   Mayor Giuliani. It was [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S461\">Page S461</a>, ]  clear to me that despite the positive news and   recommendations being conveyed by this official delegation   about the new President, President Trump had a deeply rooted   negative view on Ukraine rooted in the past. He was receiving   other information from other sources, including Mayor   Giuliani, that was more negative, causing him to retain this   negative view.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Witnesses said the reference to ``taking  me down'' was to unfounded allegations that Ukraine had interfered in  the 2016 election. This was what President Trump considered to be  corruption in Ukraine.  The President's words echoed Giuliani's public statements about  Ukraine in early May. Rather than committing to an Oval Office meeting  with the Ukrainian leader, President Trump directed the delegation to  talk to Giuliani. Here is how Ambassador Sondland described that  instruction from the President.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador SONDLAND. If we wanted to get anything done with   Ukraine, it was apparent to us we needed to talk to Rudy.  GOLDMAN. Right. You understood that Giuliani spoke for the   President, correct?  Ambassador SONDLAND. That's correct.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Ambassador Sondland saw the writing on  the wall. Sondland concluded that if we did not talk to Rudy, nothing  would move forward on Ukraine.  The three amigos, as they called themselves, did as the President  ordered and began talking to Giuliani. Dr. Hill testified Volker,  Sondland, and Perry ``gave us every impression that they were meeting  with Rudy Giuliani at this point, and Rudy Giuliani was also saying on  the television, and indeed had said subsequently, that he was closely  coordinating with the State Department.''  Like Dr. Hill, Ambassador Bolton closely tracked Giuliani's Ukraine- related activities. Hill testified about a conversation she had with  Bolton in May of 2019. That conversation was revealing, so let's  listen.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Dr. HILL. . . . And I had already brought to Ambassador   Bolton's attention the attacks, the smear campaign against   Ambassador Yovanovitch and expressed great regret about how   this was unfolding and, in fact, the shameful way in which   Ambassador Yovanovitch was being smeared and attacked.  And I had asked him if there was anything we could do about   it, and Ambassador Bolton had looked pained, basically   indicated with body language that there was nothing much we   could do about it. And he then in the course of that   discussion said that Rudy Giuliani was a hand grenade that   was going to blow everyone up.  GOLDMAN. Did you understand what he meant by that?  Dr. HILL. I did, actually.  GOLDMAN. What did he mean?  Dr. HILL. Well, I think he meant that obviously what Mr.   Giuliani was saying was pretty explosive, in any case. He was   frequently on television making quite incendiary remarks   about everyone involved in this and that he was clearly   pushing forward issues and ideas that would, you know,   probably come back to haunt us. And, in fact, I think that   that's where we are today.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. According to Dr. Hill's description,  Bolton said that Giuliani's influence could be an obstacle to increased  White House engagement with Ukraine. He instructed his staff not to  meet with Giuliani.  In June, Volker and Sondland relayed to Ambassador Taylor that  President Trump wanted to hear from Zelensky before scheduling the  meeting in the Oval Office. Ambassador Taylor testified that he did not  understand at the time what that meant.  Around this time, the President publicly expressed that he thought it  would be OK to accept foreign interference to assist his campaign if it  was in the form of opposition research on his opponent. Let's listen  to that shocking interview.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  STEPHANOPOULOS. Your campaign this time around, if   foreigners, if Russia, if China, if someone else offers you   information on opponents, should they accept it or should   they call the FBI?  PRESIDENT TRUMP. I think maybe you do both. I think you   might want to listen, there's nothing wrong with listening.   If somebody called from a country, Norway, ``we have   information on your opponent.'' Oh, I think I'd want to hear   it.  STEPHANOPOULOS. You want that kind of interference in our   elections?  PRESIDENT TRUMP. It's not an interference, they have   information. I think I'd take it.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Shocking video. Meanwhile, Giuliani  continued to press Ukraine to do the President's political dirty work.  On June 21, for instance, Giuliani tweeted the following:  New Pres of Ukraine still silent on investigation of   Ukrainian interference in 2016 election and alleged Biden   bribery of Pres Poroshenko. Time for leadership and   investigate both if you want to purge how Ukraine was abused   by Hillary and Obama people.  The quid pro quo scheme was taking shape. Giuliani was publicly  advocating for Ukraine to conduct politically motivated investigations  while President Trump refused to schedule an Oval Office meeting for  Ukraine's new President. As Ambassador Sondland testified, the scheme  to pressure Ukraine to conduct these investigations would only get more  insidious with time.  Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, the majority leader expressed a  preference for a break about 2 hours in. So it is the House managers'  request that I present, and then we take the break, if that is  acceptable for everybody.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Any objection? Move forward.  Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, counsel  for the President, and the American people, where were you on July 25,  2019? It was a Thursday. Members of the U.S. Senate were here in this  Chamber. On July 25, across the Atlantic, our 68,000 troops stationed  throughout Europe were doing what they do every day--training and  preparing to support our allies and defend against Russia.  The professionalism and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform is  a source of great strength, but America is also strong and America is  also secure because we have friends. On July 25, 2019, one of those  friends was a man named Oleksandr Markiv. In a story told by Sabra  Ayers of the Los Angeles Times, Oleksandr was a soldier in the  Ukrainian Army defending his country and Europe against Russian-backed  forces on Ukraine's eastern front. He was in a trench. He was 38 years  old. Oleksandr would later die defending his country during a mortar  attack on his fighting position, giving his life, just like over 13,000  of his fellow Ukrainians, on the frontlines of the fight for liberty in  Europe.  That same Los Angeles Times article painted a picture of what the  Ukrainians were going through during this time.  Tens of thousands of Ukrainians, like Markiv, volunteered to help  fight the Russian-backed separatists in the east. Many of them were  sent to the front line wearing sneakers and without flak jackets and  helmets, let alone rifles and ammunition. Ukrainians across the country  organized in an unprecedented united civil movement not seen since  World War II to raise money to supply their ragtag military with  everything from soldiers' boots to bullets.  And while our friends were at war with Russia wearing sneakers, some  without helmets, something else was happening. On July 25, President  Trump made a phone call. He spoke with Ukrainian President Zelensky and  asked for a favor. On that same day, just hours after his call, his  administration was quietly placing an illegal hold on critical military  aid to support our friends.  So why should any American care about what is happening in Ukraine?  Timothy Morrison, former senior director for Europe and Russia at the  NSC put it bluntly:  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Timothy MORRISON. I continue to believe Ukraine is on the   front lines of a strategic competition between the West and   Vladimir Putin's revanchist Russia. Russia is a failing   power, but it is still a dangerous one. The United States   aids Ukraine and her people so that they can fight Russia   over there, and we don't have to fight Russia here. Support   for Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty has been   a bipartisan objective since Russia's military invasion in   2014. It must continue to be.  Mr. Manager CROW. We help our partner fight Russia over there so we  don't have to fight Russia here--our friends on the frontlines, in  trenches, and with sneakers.  Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, the United States has  stood by Ukraine. Our diplomats and military commanders have long said [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S462\">Page S462</a>, ] that supporting Ukraine makes us safer. But you don't need me to tell  you that; you all know it very well. When the funding for the security  assistance came up for a vote under this roof, 87 of you voted for the  aid.  Many of you have been staunch advocates for Ukraine, working in a  nonpartisan way to support our friends. That support makes a lot of  sense because politics should not play a part in ensuring that Ukraine  can battle Russian aggression and ensure that freedom wins in Europe.  This body has, in so many ways, set that example.  Protecting Europe from Russia is not a political game. Let me provide  some background. In early 2014, in what became known as the Revolution  of Dignity, Ukrainian citizens demanded democratic reforms and an end  to corruption, ousting the pro-Russian President. Within days, Russian  military forces and their proxies invaded Ukraine, annexing Crimea and  occupying portions of eastern Ukraine.  Since 2014, more than 13,000 Ukrainians have been killed because of  the conflict and over 1.4 million have been forced from their homes.  Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the first attempt to redraw Europe's  border since World War II.  In 2017, then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis summed it up well. He  said: ``Despite Russia's denials, we know they are seeking to redraw  international borders by force, undermining the sovereign and free  nations of Europe.''  And as Ambassador Taylor put it, Russian aggression in Ukraine  ``dismissed all the principles that have kept the peace and contributed  to prosperity in Europe since World War II.''  It is clear that Russia is not just a threat in Europe but for  democracy and freedom around the world. Our friends and allies have  also responded, imposing sanctions on Russia and providing billions of  dollars in economic, humanitarian, and security assistance to Ukraine.  This has been an international effort.  Today, the European Union is the single largest contributor of  foreign assistance to Ukraine, having provided roughly $12 billion in  grants and loans since 2014. The United States has provided over $3  billion in assistance in that time, because we all know that we can't  separate our own security from the security of our friends and allies.  That is why the United States has provided economic security and  humanitarian assistance in the form of equipment and training.  Ambassador Taylor testified that American aid is a concrete  demonstration of our ``commitment to resist aggression and defend  freedom.'' He also detailed the many benefits of our assistance for  Ukraine's forces.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Chairman, the security assistance   that we provide takes many forms. One of the components of   that assistance is counter-battery radar. Another component   are sniper weapons.  These weapons and this assistance allows the Ukrainian   military to deter further incursions by the Russians against   their own--against Ukrainian territory. If that further   incursion, further aggression, were to take place, more   Ukrainians would die. So it is a deterrent effect that these   weapons provide.  It's also the ability--it gives the Ukrainians the ability   to negotiate from a position of a little more strength when   they negotiate an end to the war in Donbas, negotiating with   the Russians. This also is a way that would reduce the number   of Ukrainians who would die.  Mr. Manager CROW. I would like to make a finer point of how this type  of aid helps because I know something about counter-battery radar.  In 2005, I was an Army Ranger serving in a special operations task  force in Afghanistan. We were at a remote operating base along the  Afghan-Pakistan border. Frequently, the insurgence that we were  fighting would launch rockets and missiles onto our small base. But,  luckily, we were provided with counter-battery radar. So 20, 30, 40  seconds before those rockets and mortars rained down on us, an alarm  would sound. We would run out from our tents and jump into our concrete  bunkers and wait for the attack to end. This is not a theoretical  exercise, and the Ukrainians know it, for Ukraine aid from the United  States actually constitutes about 10 percent of their military budget.  It is safe to say that they can't fight effectively without it.  So there is no doubt. U.S. military assistance in Ukraine makes a  real difference in the fight against Russia.  In 2019, Congress provided $391 million in security assistance. This  included $250 million through the Department of Defense's Ukraine  Security Assistance Initiative, USAI, and $141 million through the  State Department's Foreign Military Financing Program, FMF.  President Trump signed the bill to authorize this aid in August 2018  and signed another bill to fund it the following month. The aid was  underway. The train was leaving the station and following the same  track it had followed every single year. But all of this was about to  change.  In July of 2019, President Trump ordered the Office of Management and  Budget, OMB, to put a hold on all of the aid. The President personally  made this decision even after his own appointed advisers warned him  that it wasn't in our country's interest to withhold the aid--after  overwhelming support in this Senate--and against longstanding policy,  even in his own administration.  But what is most interesting to me about this is that he was only  interested in the Ukraine aid, nobody else. The United States provides  aid to dozens of countries around the world, lots of partners and  allies. He didn't ask about any of them--just Ukraine.  The most important question here is why would he do that? What was  his motivation? Well, we now know why.  This hold shocked people across our own government. The Department of  Defense, along with the State Department, had already certified to  Congress that Ukraine had implemented sufficient anti-corruption  reforms to get the funds, and the Defense Department had already  notified Congress of its intent to deliver the assistance.  So let's recap all of this. Congress had already funded it. Our own  government had already certified that it met all of the standards that  it met every other year, and Congress had already been notified, just  like every other year.  In a series of meetings of the National Security Agency, everyone  except the OMB supported the provision of the assistance. OMB, as we  know, is headed by Mick Mulvaney, the President's Chief of Staff.  Ukraine experts at DOD, the State Department, and the White House  emphasized that it was in the national security interest of the United  States to continue to support Ukraine in its fight. But it wasn't just  the national security concern, because many people thought that the  hold was just outright illegal. And they were right. It was.  The President's hold did violate the law, because just last week,  Congress's independent, nonpartisan watchdog, the Government  Accountability Office, released an opinion finding that the hold was  illegal.  President Trump held the military aid money for so long that the  administration ran out of time to spend the money. Ultimately, even  after the President lifted the hold on September 11--again, with no  clear explanation why--we, the Congress, had to pass another law to  extend the deadline, delaying the delivery of the aid.  In the same L.A. Times article that told the story about our friend  Mr. Markiv, a Ukrainian defense spokesperson said that even though the  hold had been lifted--this was in September--it ``has not reached us  yet.'' That spokesperson went on to say: ``It is not just money from  the bank. It is arms, equipment and hardware.''  And to this day, millions of dollars still haven't been spent.  Although our government neither informed Ukraine of the hold nor  publicly announced it, Ukraine quickly learned about it.  On July 25, the same day as President Trump's call with President  Zelensky, officials at Ukraine's Embassy here in Washington emailed DOD  to ask about the status of the funding. By mid-August, officials at  DOD, the State Department, and the NSC received numerous questions from  Ukrainian officials about the hold. Everyone was worried. It is not  just because of the urgent need for the equipment on the frontlines but  also because of the message that it sent. You see, President Zelensky  had just been sworn in. They were very vulnerable. And, as we all know,  Vladimir Putin looks for vulnerability. He looks for hesitation. He  looks for delay. And any public sign of a hold on that aid could be a  sign of [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S463\">Page S463</a>, ] weakness that could show him it was time to pounce.  President Trump's hold on Ukraine assistance was eventually publicly  reported on August 28. As we will explain, Ukraine fully understood  that the hold was connected to the investigations that President Trump  wanted.  On February 28, DOD notified Congress that it intended to deliver  $125 million of assistance appropriated in September, including ``more  than $50 million of assistance to deliver counter-artillery radars and  defense lethal assistance.'' Congress cleared the notification, which  enabled DOD to begin spending the funds.  For Ukraine to receive the remaining $125 million, Congress required  that the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of  State, certify that the Government of Ukraine had taken substantial  anti-corruption reforms.  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper and senior  officials across our government conducted a review to evaluate whether  Ukraine had met the required benchmarks.  Ms. Cooper explained that the review involved ``pulling in all the  views of the key experts on Ukraine defense, and coming up with a  consensus view,'' which was then run ``up the chain in the Defense  Department, to ensure we have approval.''  By May 23, the anti-corruption review was complete, and DOD certified  to Congress that Ukraine had complied with all of the conditions and  that the remaining half of the aid should be released. But, again, you  don't have to take my word for it. On May 23, in a letter to Congress,  one of President Trump's senior political appointees, the Under  Secretary of Defense for Policy, wrote: ``On behalf of the Secretary of  Defense, and in coordination with the Secretary of State, I have  certified that the Government of Ukraine has taken substantial actions  to make defense institutional reforms for the purposes of decreasing  corruption, increasing accountability, and sustaining improvements of  combat capability enabled by U.S. assistance.''  Congress then cleared the funding, which should have allowed Ukraine  to receive the aid. But we know that is not what happened.  On June 18, as DOD was preparing to send the aid, they issued a press  release--as they normally do--announcing that it would provide $250  million in security assistance to Ukraine ``for additional training,  equipment, and advisory efforts to build the capacity of Ukraine's  armed forces.'' This included sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenades,  counter-artillery radars, command and control, electronic warfare,  secure communications, vehicles, night vision, and medical  equipment. However, according to the New York Times, 1 day after the  Defense Department issued this press release--1 day--Assistant to the  President Robert Blair, who works for Mick Mulvaney, called OMB Acting  Director Russell Vought to tell him: ``We need to hold it up.'' The  ``it'' was the assistance.  That same day, June 19, President Trump gave an interview on FOX News  where he raised the so-called CrowdStrike conspiracy theory that  Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 2016 election, a line he  would echo during his July 25 call with President Zelensky. This  theory, by the way, has been advanced by Russian propaganda to try to  take attention away from Russian interference and shift it onto  Ukraine. It is a theory that has been universally debunked by U.S.  intelligence and law enforcement.  Nonetheless, the President, spurred by the June 18 press release and  with the false theory about the Ukraine interference, supposedly, in  the 2016 election, started asking about the Ukraine assistance. On June  19, OMB Associate Director for National Security Michael Duffey emailed  Elaine McCusker, the DOD comptroller. He said the President had  questions about the press report and that he was seeking additional  information. This was a reference to an article in the Washington  Examiner, shown here on the slide in front of you.  The White House withheld this email from the House, of course. We  first learned of it from Duffey's deputy, Mark Sandy, who testified  that he was copied on it. Subsequently, as a result of a lawsuit under  the Freedom of Information Act, the public and, therefore, Congress  received a copy of that email, but the White House still refuses to  comply with the subpoenas for this and other documents.  On June 20, McCusker responded to President Trump's inquiry by  providing Sandy information on the security assistance program. Sandy  shared the information with Duffey, but he did not know whether Duffey  shared the information with the White House. Laura Cooper also recalled  receiving an email inquiry about Ukraine's security assistance ``a few  days'' after DOD's June 18 press release. She noted that it was  ``relatively unusual'' to receive questions from the President. In  response, DOD provided materials explaining that the $250 million  funding package was for additional training, equipment, and advisory  efforts to build the capacity of Ukraine's Armed Forces. DOD emphasized  that ``almost all of the dozens of vendors are U.S. companies,''  meaning that this funding also benefited U.S. businesses and workers.  Nonetheless, President Trump put the wheels in motion to freeze the  funds shortly after learning about DOD's plan to release the funds.  According to a New York Times article on June 27, Chief of Staff  Mulvaney emailed Blair:  I am just trying to tie up some loose ends. Did we ever   find out about the money from Ukraine and whether we can hold   it back?  Blair reportedly responded that it would be possible but not pretty.  He added: ``Expect Congress to become unhinged.'' I suppose he said  that for all the reasons we have talked about earlier, because this  Chamber and our Chamber on the other side of the Capitol resoundingly  supports it.  And that was just the Defense Department assistance to Ukraine. For  2019, Congress also appropriated $141 million to Ukraine through the  State Department. Unlike the Defense Department funding, which was  approved by Congress and ready to be spent, OMB blocked the State  Department from even seeking Congress's approval to release the funds.  I am going to pause here to, once again, stress that we have learned  a lot about the circumstances around the initial hold only from the  public release of and reporting about these emails in the past few  weeks. The White House has refused to provide these emails in response  to a subpoena.  Mick Mulvaney and Rob Blair refused to comply with the subpoena to  testify. These emails are just a few of the many thousands that likely  exist on this topic but which have been concealed from Congress and the  American people because of ongoing obstruction. In fact, last night, as  we were here late into the night, sometime around midnight, a new  tranche of documents were released under a Freedom of Information Act  request by an independent watchdog that had been asking for them--they  were released last night--between Mr. Duffey and Elaine McCusker, and  others, on the things that I am talking about right now. Unfortunately,  as you can see, there isn't a lot to read here because it is all  blacked out. So, if the President's lawyers contest any of the facts  that I am talking about, you should demand to see the full record. The  American people deserve to see the full truth when it comes to  Presidential actions.  Back to the timeline, from July to September of 2019, the President  and his advisers at the White House and OMB implemented the hold on  Ukraine assistance through an unusual and unlawful process. First, on  July 3, the State Department notified DOD and NSC staff that OMB was  blocking its notification to Congress. According to Jennifer Williams,  Vice President Pence's aide, the hold on this assistance ``came out of  the blue'' because it had not been previously discussed by OMB or NSC.  Around July 12, President Trump directed that a hold be placed on the  DOD security assistance as well. That day, Mr. Blair sent an email to  Duffey at OMB informing him ``that the President is directing a hold on  military support funding for Ukraine.''  Around July 15, Tim Morrison learned from Deputy National Security  Advisor Charles Kupperman ``that it was the President's direction to  hold the assistance.'' Several days later, Duffey and Blair again  exchanged emails about Ukraine's security assistance, and Sandy  testified that, in these [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S464\">Page S464</a>, ] emails, Duffey asked Blair about the reason for the hold. Blair  provided no explanation. Instead, he said: ``We need to let the hold  take place'' and then ``revisit'' the issue with the President.  Between July 18 and July 31, the NSC staff convened several  interagency meetings at which the hold on security assistance was  discussed. Remember those dates: July 18 to July 31. According to Mark  Sandy and other witnesses, several facts emerged. First, the agencies  learned that the President himself had directed the hold through OMB.  Second, no justification or explanation was provided for the hold,  despite repeated questions. Third, except for OMB, all agencies were  supporting military aid because it was in the national security  interests of the United States. And fourth, many were concerned that  the hold was outright illegal.  Ambassador Taylor learned of the hold on July 18. He said the  ``directive had come from the President to the Chief of Staff to OMB''  and that he ``sat in astonishment'' because ``one of the key pillars of  our strong support for Ukraine was threatened.''  David Holmes, a diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, testified that  he was shocked by the hold. Although there was initially some question  as to whether the hold applied to DOD funds, which was already cleared  by Congress, it soon became clear that the hold applied to all $391  million.  Tim Morrison testified that DOD officials raised concerns at a  meeting on July 23 about whether it was ``actually legally permissible  for the President to not allow for the disbursement of the funding.''  These concerns related to possible violations of the Impoundment  Control Act, the law that gives a President the authority to delay or  withhold funds only if Congress is notified of those intentions and  approves the proposed action. Of course, neither of those things had  been done. The issue was escalated quickly, and at a senior-level  meeting on July 26, OMB remained the lone voice for holding the aid.  According to Tim Morrison, OMB said that President Trump was concerned  about corruption in Ukraine. Cooper, from DOD, also attended the July  meeting. She received no further understanding of what was meant by  ``corruption.'' There was never a principals meeting convened on this  issue, but there was a fourth and final interagency meeting on July 31.  Remember that date? A fourth and final one.  There is a process for making sure that U.S. aid money makes it to  the right place, to the right people.  Mr. Chief Justice, I do see a lot of Members moving and taking a  break. Would you like to take a break at this time? I have another,  probably, 15 minutes.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. I think we can continue.    ", "Mr. GOLDMAN": " Mr. GOLDMAN. Did you go to see the lawyers?  Dr. HILL. I certainly did.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. What I want to ask you about is, he   makes reference in that drug deal to a drug deal cooked up by   you and Mulvaney. It's the reference to Mulvaney that I want   to ask you about. You've testified that Mulvaney was aware of   this quid pro quo, of this condition that the Ukrainians had   to meet, that is, announcing these public investigations to   get the White House meeting. Is that right?  Ambassador SONDLAND. Yeah. A lot of people were aware of it   . . .  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Including Mr. Mulvaney.  Ambassador SONDLAND. Correct.  Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Remarkably, the President is still denying the  facts, even as they argue that if it is true, it is still not  impeachable. But if the President did nothing wrong, if he held up the  aid because of so-called corruption or burden-sharing reasons, he  should want his chief of staff to come testify under oath before this  distinguished body and say just that.  Why doesn't he want Mulvaney to appear before the United States  Senate? Well, we know the answer--because Mr. Mulvaney will confirm the  corrupt shakedown scheme because Mr. Mulvaney was in the loop.  Everyone was in the loop.  As Ambassador Sondland summarized in his testimony on July 19, he  emailed several top administration officials, including Mr. Mulvaney,  that President Zelensky was prepared to receive POTUS's call and would  ``assure'' President Trump that ``he intends to run a fully transparent  investigation and will `turn over every stone.'''  Mr. Mulvaney replied: ``I asked NSC to set it up for tomorrow.''  The above email seems clear. Ambassador Sondland testified that it  was clear; that he was confirming to Mr. Mulvaney that he had told  President Zelensky he had to tell President Trump on that July 25 call  that he would announce the investigation, which he explained was a  reference to one of the two phony political investigations that  President Trump wanted. And Mr. Mulvaney replies that he will set up  the meeting--consistent with the agreement that Sondland explained he  reached with Mr. Mulvaney to condition a meeting on the investigations.  But if there is any uncertainty, if there is any lingering questions  about what this means, let's just question Mick Mulvaney under oath.  Mr. Mulvaney also matters because we have heard several questions  from this distinguished body of Senators wanting to understand when or  why or how the President ordered the hold on the security aid. As the  head of the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Mulvaney has unique  insights into all of these questions--your questions.  Remember that email exchange between Mr. Mulvaney and his Deputy, Rob  Blair, on June 27, when Mulvaney asked Blair about whether they could  implement the hold and Blair responded that it could be done but that  Congress would become ``unhinged''?  It wasn't just Congress. It was the independent Government  Accountability Office that determined that the President's hold  violated the law. But, if the President's counsel is going to argue-- without evidence--that he withheld the aid as part of U.S. foreign  policy, it seems to make sense that the Senate should hear directly  from Mr. Mulvaney, who has firsthand knowledge of exactly these facts.  He said so himself.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Mr. MULVANEY: Again, I was involved with the process by   which the money was held up temporarily, okay?  Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Why doesn't President Trump want Mick Mulvaney  to testify? Why?  Perhaps here is why:  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Answer. Did he also mention to me in the past that the   corruption related to the DNC server, absolutely. No question   about that. But that's it. And that's why we held up the   money.  Question. So the demand for an investigation into the   Democrats was part of the reason that he wanted to withhold   funding to Ukraine.  Answer. The look back to what happened in 2016--  Question. The investigation into Democrats--  Answer.--certainly was part of the thing that he was   worried about in corruption with that nation. That is   absolutely appropriate.  Question. But to be clear, what you just described is a   quid pro quo. It is: Funding will not flow unless the   investigation into the Democratic server happens as well.  Answer. We do that all the time with foreign policy. We   were holding the money at the same time for--what was it? The   Northern Triangle countries. We were holding up aid to the   Northern Triangle countries so that they would change their   policies on immigration. By the way, and this speaks to an   important--I'm sorry? This speaks to an important point,   because I heard this yesterday and I can never remember the   gentleman whose testimony--Was it McKinney, the guy--was that   his name? I don't know him. He testified yesterday. And if   you go--and if you believe those reports--okay? Because we've   not seen any transcripts of this. The only transcript I've   seen was Sondland's testimony this morning. If you read the   news reports and you believe them--what did McKinney say   yesterday? Well, McKinney said yesterday that he was really   upset with the political influence in foreign policy. That   was one of the reasons he was so upset about this. And I have   news for everybody: Get over it. There's going to be   political influence in foreign policy.  Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Is that what the Constitution requires--``Get  over it''? Is that good enough for this body, the world's greatest  deliberative body--``Get over it''?  The President's counsel can try to emphasize Mr. Mulvaney and his  attorneys' efforts to walk back this statement, but, as you have seen  with your own eyes, the statement was unequivocal. And even when given  the chance in real time on that day, on October 17, to deny a quid pro  quo, he doubled down. ``Get over it,'' he said.  But if you have any questions about what the real answer is and where  the truth lies, there is only one way to find out: Let's all just  question Mr. Mulvaney under oath during the Senate trial. After all,  counsel said that cross-examination was the greatest vehicle in the  history of American jurisprudence ever invented to ascertain the  truth--your standard.  Finally, I would like to touch briefly on the importance of Mr. Blair  and Mr. Duffey to this case.  The President's lawyers have argued that withholding foreign aid is  entirely within his right as Commander in Chief; that this was a  normal, ordinary decision; and that this is all just one big policy  disagreement.  We have proven exactly the opposite. This can't be a policy  disagreement because the President's hold actually went against U.S.  policy. The hold was undertaken outside of the normal channels by a  President who, they admit, was not conducting policy. The hold was  concealed not only from Congress but from the President's own officials  responsible for Ukraine policy, [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S759\">Page S759</a>, ] and, most importantly, the hold violated the law.  The President has the right to make policy, but he does not have the  right to break the law and coerce an ally into helping him cheat in our  free and fair elections, and he doesn't have a right to use hundreds of  millions of dollars in taxpayer funds as leverage to get political dirt  on an American citizen who happens to be his political opponent.  But if you remain unsure about all of this, who better to ask than  Mr. Blair or Mr. Duffey? They oversaw and executed the process of  withholding the aid. They can tell us exactly how unrelated to business  as usual this whole shakedown scheme was when it was underway. They can  testify about why the aid was withheld and whether there was any  legitimate explanation for withholding it. Some of you have asked that  very question.  Multiple officials--including Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Taylor,  David Holmes, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, Jennifer Williams, and Mark  Sandy--all testified that they were never given a credible explanation  for the hold. So let's ask Mr. Blair and let's ask Mr. Duffey if this  happens all the time, as Mick Mulvaney suggests. Why, at this time, in  connection with this scheme, were all of those witnesses left in the  dark?  Despite the President's refusal to produce a single document and to  produce a shred of information in this impeachment inquiry undertaken  in the House, his administration did produce 192 pages of Ukraine- related email records in Freedom of Information Act lawsuits, albeit in  heavily redacted form. These documents confirm Mr. Duffey's central  role in executing the hold. He is on nearly every single impeachment  release--nearly every single email.  Here is an important email from that production.  Just 90 minutes after the July 25 call, Mr. Duffey emailed officials  at the Department of Defense that they should ``hold off on any  additional DOD obligations of these funds.'' Mr. Duffey added that the  request was ``sensitive'' and that they should keep this information  ``closely held.'' The timing is important because if the aid wasn't  linked to the July 25 call and if it wasn't related, why the sensitive,  closely held request made within 2 hours of that call? Let's just ask  Mr. Duffey.  Mr. Duffey and Mr. Blair can testify about the concerns raised by DOD  to the Office of Management and Budget about the illegality of the hold  and why it remained in place even after DOD warned the administration  that it would violate the Impoundment Control Act.  Now, the President, of course, has disputed this fact, but we have  demonstrated that OMB was warned repeatedly by DOD officials of two  things: first, continuing to withhold the aid would prevent the  Department of Defense from spending the money before the end of the  fiscal year, and second, the hold was potentially illegal, as turned  out to be the case.  By August 9, DOD told Mr. Duffey directly that DOD--the Department of  Defense--could no longer support the Office of Management and Budget's  claims that the hold would ``not preclude timely execution'' of the aid  for Ukraine, our vulnerable ally at war with Russian-backed  separatists. Yet, as Mr. Duffey reportedly told Ms. McCusker at the  Department of Defense on August 30, there was a ``clear direction from  POTUS to continue to hold''--clear direction from the President of the  United States to continue the hold. So how did Mr. Duffey understand  the ``clear direction'' to continue the hold? Why is the President  claiming that this wasn't unlawful when DOD--the Department of  Defense--repeatedly warned his administration that it was? Wouldn't we  all like to ask Mr. Duffey these questions?  Finally, here is another reason why we know this was not business as  usual. On July 29, Mr. Duffey--a political appointee with zero relevant  experience--abruptly seized responsibility for withholding the aid from  Mark Sandy, a career Office of Management and Budget official--seized  the responsibility from a career official. Mr. Duffey provided no  credible explanation for that decision.  Mr. Sandy testified that nothing like that had ever happened in his  entire governmental career. Let's think about that. If this is as  routine as the President claims, why is a career official saying he has  never seen anything like this happen before? Mr. Duffey knows why.  Shouldn't we just take the time to ask him?  The American people deserve a fair trial. The Constitution deserves a  fair trial. The President deserves a fair trial. A fair trial means  witnesses. A fair trial means documents. A fair trial means evidence.  No one is above the law.  I yield to my distinguished colleague, Manager Lofgren.  Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, it is not just  about hearing from witnesses; you need documents. The documents don't  lie. There are specific documents relevant to this impeachment trial in  the custody of the White House, OMB, DOD, and the State Department, and  the President has hidden them from us.  I am not going to go through each category again in detail, but here  are some observations.  This is, of course, an impeachment case against the President of the  United States. Nothing could be more important. And the most important  documents--documents that go directly to who knew what when--are being  held by the executive branch.  Many of these records are at the White House. The White House has  records about the phone calls with President Zelensky, about scheduling  an Oval Office meeting with President Zelensky, about the President's  decision to hold security assistance, about communications among his  top aides, and about concerns raised by public officials with legal  counsel. We have heard about Ambassador Bolton's handwritten notes and  book manuscript and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's Presidential policy  memorandum. We know of reports about a number of emails in early August  trying to create after-the-fact justifications for the hold, but we  haven't seen any of them. They are at the White House being hidden by  the President. I think it is a coverup.  Documents are also at the State Department, records about the recall  of Ambassador Yovanovitch, about Giuliani's efforts for the President,  about concerns raised about the hold, about the Ukrainian reaction to  the hold and when exactly they learned about it, and about negotiations  with the Ukrainians for an Oval Office meeting. We know about  Ambassador Taylor's first-person cable and notes and Mr. Kent's memos  to file. We know about Mr. Sondland's emails with Pompeo and Brechbuhl  and Mulvaney and Perry, but we haven't seen them. They are sitting in  the State Department.  DOD and OMB also have records--records about President Trump's hold  on military aid to Ukraine, about the justification for the hold, about  hiding the hold from Congress and trying to justify the hold after the  fact, and about why the hold was lifted, but we haven't seen them. They  are at DOD and OMB. Why haven't we seen them? Because the President  directed all his agencies not to produce them.  This trial should not reward the President's really unprecedented  obstruction by allowing him to control what evidence you see and what  will remain hidden. You should ask for these documents on behalf of the  American people, and you should ask for these documents to get the  truth yourself.  Now, let's come back to the issue of delay, since the President's  lawyers have suggested that having witnesses and documents would make  this trial take too long. There will be lengthy court battles, they  say. The President might even invoke executive privilege for the very  first time in this entire impeachment process. It would be better, we  are told, to skip straight to the final verdict, to break from  centuries of precedent and end this trial without hearing from a single  witness and without reviewing a single document that the President  ordered hidden. Respectfully, that shouldn't happen.  House managers aren't interested in delaying these proceedings. We  are interested in the full truth; in a trial that is fair to the  parties and to the American people; in the facts that the President's  counsel agrees are so critical to this trial. It is why we said we [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S760\">Page S760</a>, ] won't go to court; we will follow all the rulings of the Chief Justice.  We can get the witness depositions done in a week. In fact, I know we  can because if you, the Senators, order it, that is the law. You have  the sole power to try impeachments.  If questions or objections come up, including objections based on  executive privilege, the Senate itself and the Chief Justice, in the  first instance, can resolve them. We aren't suggesting that the  President waive executive privilege. We simply suggest that the Chief  Justice can resolve issues related to any assertion of executive  privilege.  As the Supreme Court recognized in the case of Judge Walter Nixon,  judges will stay out of disputes over how the Senate exercises its sole  power to try impeachments. That ensures there will be no unnecessary  delay, and it is why we propose we suspend the trial for 1 week, and  that during that time, you go back to business as usual. While the  trial is suspended, we will take witness depositions and review the  documents that are provided at your direction.  The four witnesses you should hear from are readily available.  Ambassador Bolton has already said he will appear. We can and would  move quickly to depose these witnesses within a week of the issuance of  subpoenas. The documents, too, are ready to be produced. We are ready  to review them quickly and to present additional evidence. Meanwhile,  the Senate can continue going about its important legislative work, as  it did during the depositions in the Clinton impeachment trial.  The President's opposition to this suggestion says a lot. The  President is the architect of the very delay he warns against. He could  easily avoid it. He could move things along. He could stop trying to  silence witnesses and hide evidence. I think he is afraid the truth  will come out. He hopes his threats of continued delay, however  unjustified, will cause you to throw up your hands and give up on a  fair trial. Please don't give up. This is too important for our  democracy.  A decision to forgo witnesses and documents at this trial would be a  big departure from Senate precedent. When the Senate investigated  Watergate, it heard from the highest White House officials. That  happened because a bipartisan majority of the Senate insisted. We got  to the truth then because the Senate came together and put a fair  proceeding above party loyalty.  We should all want the truth, and so we ask you to do it again--that  you put aside any politics, party loyalty. Believe in your President,  which we understand and sympathize with, but subpoena the documents and  the witnesses necessary to make this a fair trial, to hear and see the  evidence you need to impartially administer justice.  Now, there has been a lot of discussion of executive privilege during  this trial. Even if the President asserts executive privilege-- something he has not yet done--it wouldn't harm the President's legal  rights or cause undue delay.  Here is why. Let's focus on John Bolton, since this week's  revelations confirm the importance of his testimony.  First, as a private citizen, John Bolton is fully protected by the  First Amendment if he wants to testify. There is no basis for imposing  prior restraint for censoring him just because some of his testimony  could include conversations with the President. That is commonplace. As  long as his testimony isn't classified, it is shielded by the free  speech clause of the First Amendment.  Ambassador Bolton has written a book. It is inconceivable that he is  forbidden from telling the U.S. Senate, sitting as a High Court of  Impeachment, information that shortly will be in print.  If the President did attempt to invoke executive privilege, he would  fail. It is true for separate reasons. First, claims of executive  privilege always involve a balancing of interests. The Supreme Court  confirmed in U.S. v. Nixon--the Nixon tapes case--that executive  privilege can be overcome by a need for evidence in a criminal trial.  That is even more true here in an impeachment trial of the President of  the United States, which is probably the most important interest under  the Constitution. It would certainly outweigh any claim of privilege.  Precedent confirms the point. To name just a few, National Security  Advisors for President Carter, Zbigniew Brzezinski; President Clinton,  Samuel Berger; President George W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice; and  President Obama, Susan Rice, testified in congressional investigations.  These advisors discussed their communications with top government  officials, including the Presidents they served. There is no reason why  all of these officials could testify in the normal course of events and  hearings, but Ambassador Bolton, a former official, couldn't testify in  the most important trial there could possibly be.  The second reason is the President waived any claim of executive  privilege about Ambassador Bolton's testimony. All 17 witnesses  testified in the House about these matters without any assertion of  privilege by the President.  President Trump, as well as his lawyers and senior officials, have  publicly discussed and tweeted about these issues at some length. The  President has also directly denied reports about what Ambassador Bolton  will say in his forthcoming book. Under these circumstances, the  President cannot be allowed to tell his version of his story to the  public while using executive privilege to silence a key witness who  would contradict him. You shouldn't let the President escape  responsibility only to later see clearly what happened in Ambassador  Bolton's book.  There are no national security risks here. The President has  declassified the two phone calls with President Zelensky. All 17  witnesses testified about the President's conduct regarding Ukraine. We  aren't interested in asking about anything other than Ukraine. That is  simply a bogus argument.  The Constitution uses the words ``sole power'' only twice: first,  when it gives the House sole power to impeach; and, second, article 1,  section 3, where it gives the Senate sole power to try impeachments.  Here is what it says:  The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all   Impeachments. . . . When the President of the United States   is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.  Now, I think that provision in the Constitution means something. It  is up to the Senate to decide how to try this impeachment with  fairness, with witnesses, and documents.  Privileges asserted can be decided using the process that you devise.  That is not unconstitutional. It is what the Constitution provides.  You have the power. You decide. Please decide for a fair trial that  would yield the truth and serve our Constitution and the American  people.  I yield now to Manager Schiff.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, before we yield to counsel for the  President, I would like to take a moment by talking about what I think  is at stake here. A ``no'' vote on the question before you will have  long-lasting and harmful consequences long after this impeachment trial  is over.  We agree with the President's counsel on this much: This will set a  new precedent. This will be cited in impeachment trials from this point  to the end of history. You can bet in every impeachment that follows,  whether it is a Presidential impeachment or the impeachment of a judge,  if that judge or President believes that it is to his or her advantage  that there shall be a trial with no witnesses, they will cite the case  of Donald J. Trump. They will make the argument that you can adjudicate  the guilt or innocence of the party who is accused without hearing from  a single witness, without reviewing a single document. And I would  submit that will be a very dangerous and long-lasting precedent that we  will all have to live with.  President Trump's wholesale obstruction of Congress strikes at the  heart of our Constitution and democratic system of separation of  powers. Make no mistake. The President's actions in this impeachment  inquiry constitute an attack on congressional oversight on the coequal  nature of this branch of government, not just on the House but on the  Senate's ability, as well, to conduct its oversight, to serve as a  check and balance on this President and every President that follows.  If the Senate allows President Trump's obstruction to stand, it  effectively nullifies the impeachment power. It will allow future  Presidents to decide whether they want their misconduct to be  investigated or not, [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S761\">Page S761</a>, ] whether they would like to participate in an impeachment investigation  or not. That is a power of the Congress. That is not a power of the  President. By permitting a categorical obstruction, it turns the  impeachment power against itself.  How we respond to this unprecedented obstruction will shape future  debates between our branches of government and the executive forever.  And it is not just impeachment. The ability of Congress to conduct  meaningful and probing oversight--oversight that, by its nature, is  intended to be a check and balance on the awesome powers of the  executive branch--hinges on our willingness to call witnesses and  compel documents that President Trump is hiding with no valid  justification, no precedential support.  If we tell the President, effectively, ``You can act corruptly, you  can abuse the powers of your office to coerce a foreign government to  helping you cheat in an election by withholding military aid, and when  you are caught, you can further abuse your powers by concealing the  evidence of your wrongdoing,'' the President becomes unaccountable to  anyone. Our government is no longer a government with three coequal  branches. The President effectively, for all intents and purposes,  becomes above the law.  This is, of course, the opposite of what the Framers intended. They  purposely entrusted the power of impeachment to the legislative branch  so that it may protect the American people from a President who  believes that he can do whatever he wants.  So we must consider how our actions will reverberate for decades to  come and the impact they will have on the functioning of our democracy.  And as we consider this critical decision, it is important to remember  that no matter what you decide to do here, whether you decide to hear  witnesses and relevant testimony, the facts will come out in the end.  Even over the course of this trial, we have seen so many additional  facts come to light. The facts will come out. In all of their horror,  they will come out, and there are more court documents and deadlines  under the Freedom of Information Act. Witnesses will tell their stories  in future congressional hearings, in books, and in the media. This week  has made that abundantly clear.  The documents the President is hiding will come out. The witnesses  the President is concealing will tell their stories. And we will be  asked why we didn't want to hear that information when we had the  chance, when we could consider its relevance and importance in making  this most serious decision. What answer shall we give if we do not  pursue the truth now, if we allow it to remain hidden until it is too  late to consider on the profound issue of the President's innocence or  guilt?  What we are asking you to do on behalf of the American people is  simple: Use your sole power to try this impeachment by holding a fair  trial. Get the documents they refuse to provide to the House. Hear the  witnesses they refuse to make available to the House, just as this body  has done in every single impeachment trial until now.  Let the American people know that you understand they deserve the  truth. Let them know you still care about the truth, that the truth  still matters.  Though much divides us, on this we should agree: A trial, stripped of  all its trappings, should be a search for the truth, and that requires  witnesses and testimony.  Now, you may have seen just this afternoon, the President's former  Chief of Staff, General Kelly, said ``a Senate trial without witnesses  is a job only half done.'' A trial without witnesses is only half a  trial. Well, I have to say I can't agree. A trial without witnesses is  no trial at all. You either have a trial or you don't. And if you are  going to have a real trial, you need to hear from the people who have  firsthand information. Now, we have presented some of them to you, but  you know as well as we there are others that you should hear from.  Let me close this portion with words, I think, more powerful than  General Kelly's. They come from John Adams, who in 1776 wrote: Together  with the right to vote, those who wrote our Constitution considered the  right to trial by jury ``the heart and lungs, the mainspring and the  center wheel'' of our liberties, without which ``the body must die, the  watch must run down, the government must become arbitrary.''  Now, what does that mean? Without a fair trial, the government must  become arbitrary. Now, of course, he is talking about the right of an  average citizen to a trial by jury.  Well, if in courtrooms all across America, when someone is tried but  they are a person of influence and power, they can declare at the  beginning of the trial ``If the government's case is so good, let them  prove it without witnesses''; if people of power and influence can  insist to the judge that the House, that the prosecutors, that the  government, that the people must prove their case without witnesses or  documents, a right reserved only for the powerful--because, you know,  only Donald Trump--only Donald Trump, of any defendant in America can  insist on a trial with no witnesses--if that should be true in courts  throughout the land, then, as Adams wrote, the government becomes  arbitrary because whether you have a fair trial or no trial at all  depends on whether you are a person of power and influence like Donald  J. Trump.  The body will die. The clock will run down. And our government  becomes arbitrary. The importance of a fair trial here is not less than  in every courtroom in America; it is greater than in any courtroom in  America because we set the example for America.  I said at the outset, and I will repeat again: Your decision on guilt  or innocence is important, but it is not the most important decision.  If we have a fair trial, however that trial turns out, whatever your  verdict may be, at least we can agree we had a fair trial. At least we  can agree that the House had a fair opportunity to present its case. At  least we can agree that the President had a fair opportunity to present  their case--if we have a fair trial. And we can disagree about the  verdict, but we can all agree the system worked as it was intended. We  had a fair trial, and we reached a decision.  Rob this country of a fair trial, and there can be no representation  that the verdict has any meaning. How could it, if the result is baked  in by the process? Assure the American people, whatever the result may  be, that at least they got a fair shake.  There is a reason why the American people want to hear from  witnesses, and it is not just about curiosity. It is because they  recognize that in every courtroom in America that is just what happens.  And if it doesn't happen here, the government has become arbitrary;  there is one person who is entitled to a different standard, and that  is the President of the United States. And that is the last thing the  Founders intended.  Mr. Chief Justice, we reserve the balance of our time.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.  The majority leader is recognized.  Recess    ", "Ms. MADDOW": " Ms. MADDOW. That was the only motivation?    ", "Mr. PARNAS": " Mr. PARNAS. There was no other motivation.  Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. These are just some of the email communications  that we know to exist, but there are undoubtedly more, including, for  example, Ambassador Yovanovitch's request for the State Department to  issue a statement of support of her around the time that Mr. Giuliani  was speaking directly with Secretary Pompeo, but that statement never  came.  The State Department has gathered these records, and they are ready  to be turned over pursuant to a subpoena from the Senate. It would not  be a time-consuming or lengthy process to obtain them, and there are  clearly--clearly--important and relevant documents to the President's  scheme. If we want the full and complete truth, then we need to see  those emails.  The Senate should also seek a third item that the State Department  has refused to provide, and that is Ambassador Taylor's extraordinary  first-person diplomatic cable to Secretary Pompeo, dated August 29 and  sent at the recommendation of the National Security Advisor, John  Bolton, in which Ambassador Taylor strenuously objected to the  withholding of military aid from Ukraine, as Ambassador Taylor  recounted in his deposition.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador TAYLOR. Near the end of Ambassador Bolton's   visit, I asked to meet him privately, during which I   expressed to him my serious concern about the withholding of   military assistance to Ukraine while the Ukrainians were   defending their country from Russian aggression. Ambassador   Bolton recommended that I send a first-person cable to   Secretary Pompeo directly relaying my concerns.  I wrote and transmitted such a cable on August 29th,   describing the folly I saw in withholding military aid to   Ukraine at a time when hostilities were still active in the   east and when Russia was watching closely to gauge the level   of American support for [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S398\">Page S398</a>, ]  the Ukrainian Government. The Russians, as I said at my   deposition, would love to see the humiliation of President   Zelensky at the hands of the Americans. I told the Secretary   that I could not and would not defend such a policy.  Although I received no specific response, I heard that soon   thereafter the Secretary carried the cable with him to a   meeting at the White House focused on security assistance for   Ukraine.  Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. While we know from Ambassador Taylor and Deputy  Assistant Secretary Kent that the cable was received, we do not know  whether or how the State Department responded, nor do we know if the  State Department possesses any other internal records relating to this  cable.  This cable is vital for three reasons. First, it demonstrates the  harm that President Trump did to our national security when he used  foreign policy as an instrument of his own personal, political gain.  Second, on the same day the cable was sent, President Zelensky's senior  aide told Ambassador Taylor that he was ``very concerned'' about the  hold on military assistance. He added that the Ukrainians were ``just  desperate'' for it to be released. In other words, President Trump's  effort to use military aid to apply additional pressure on Ukraine was  working.  Finally, based on reporting by the New York Times, we now know that  within days of Ambassador Taylor sending this cable, President Trump  discussed Ukrainian security assistance with Secretary Pompeo, Defense  Secretary Esper, and National Security Advisor Bolton. The  investigation uncovered testimony that Secretary Pompeo brought  Ambassador Taylor's cable to the White House; perhaps it was during  this meeting. There, perhaps prodded by Ambassador Taylor's cable, all  three of them pleaded--pleaded--with the President to resume the  crucial military aid. Yet the President refused.  This body has a right to see Ambassador Taylor's cable, as well as  the other State Department records addressing the official response to  it. Although it may have been classified at the time, the State  Department could no longer claim that the topic of security assistance  remains classified today in light of the President's decision to  declassify his two telephone calls with President Zelensky and Mr.  Mulvaney's public statements about security assistance.  The fourth category of documents that the Senate should subpoena are  contemporaneous, first-person accounts from State Department officials  who were caught up in President Trump's corrupt scheme. These  documents, which were described in detail by Deputy Assistant Secretary  Kent, Ambassador Taylor, and political officer David Holmes, would help  complete the record and clarify how the President's scheme unfolded in  realtime and how the Ukrainians reacted.  Mr. Kent wrote notes or memos to file at least four times, according  to his testimony. Ambassador Taylor took extensive notes of nearly  every conversation he had--some in a little notebook. David Holmes, the  Embassy official in Ukraine, was a consistent notetaker of important  meetings with Ukrainian officials.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)    ", "Mr. KENT": " Mr. KENT. That is correct. I received a text message from   one of my Ukrainian counterparts forwarding that article, and   that is the first they raised it with me.  Mr. Counsel PURPURA. The House managers didn't show you this  testimony from any of these four witnesses. Why not? Why didn't they  give you the context of this testimony? Think about this as well. If  the Ukrainians had been aware of the review on security assistance,  they, of course, would have said something. There were numerous high- level diplomatic meetings between senior Ukrainian and U.S. officials  during the summer after the review on the security assistance began,  but before President Zelensky learned of the hold through the POLITICO  article. If the Ukrainians had known about the hold, they would have  raised it in one of those meetings. Yet the Ukrainians didn't say  anything about the hold at a single one of those meetings, not on July  9, not on July 10, not on July 25, not on July 26, not on August 27. At  none of those meetings--none of those meetings--did the Ukrainians  mention the pause on security assistance.  Ambassador Volker testified that he was regularly in touch with the  senior, highest level officials in the Ukrainian Government and that  the Ukrainian officials would confide things and would have asked if  they had any questions about the aid. Nobody said a word to Ambassador  Volker until the end of August.  Then, within hours of the POLITICO article's being published, Mr.  Yermak texted Ambassador Volker with a link to the article and to ask  about the report. In other words, as soon as the Ukrainians learned  about the hold, they asked about it.  Mr. Schiff said something during the 21 hours--or more than 21  hours--that he and his team spoke that I actually agree with, which is  when he talked about common sense. Many of us at the tables and in the  room are former prosecutors at the State, Federal, or military level.  Prosecutors talk a lot about common sense. Common sense comes into play  right here.  The top Ukrainian officials said nothing--nothing at all--to their  U.S. counterparts during all of these meetings about the pause on  security assistance, but then--boom. As soon as the POLITICO article  comes out, suddenly, in that first intense week of September, in George  Kent's words, security assistance was all they wanted to talk about.  What must we conclude if we are using our common sense?--that they  didn't know about the pause until the POLITICO article on August 28.  There was no activity before. The article comes out, and there is a  flurry of activity.  That is common sense, and it is absolutely fatal to the House  managers' case. The House managers are aware that the Ukrainians' lack  of knowledge on the hold is fatal to their case, so they desperately  tried to muddy the water.  The managers told you the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense,  Laura Cooper, presented two emails that people on her staff received  from people at the State Department regarding conversations with people  at the Ukraine Embassy that could have been about U.S. security  assistance to Ukraine. What they did not tell you is that Ms. Cooper  testified that she could not say for certain whether the emails were  about the pause on security assistance. She couldn't say one way or  another.  She also testified that she didn't want to speculate about the  meaning of the words in the emails. The House managers also didn't tell  you that Ms. Cooper testified: ``I reviewed my calendar, and the only  meeting where I can recall a Ukrainian official raising the issue of  security assistance with me is on September 5 at the Ukrainian  Independence Day celebration.'' The House managers didn't tell you  that.  The House managers also mentioned that one of Ambassador Volker's  advisers, Catherine Croft, claimed that the Ukrainian Embassy officials  learned about the pause earlier than the POLITICO article; but when  asked when she heard from Ukraine Embassy officials, Ms. Croft admitted  that she can't remember those specifics and did not think that she took  notes.  Ms. Croft also did not remember when news of the hold became public.  Remember though, that Ambassador Volker, her boss, who was in regular  contact with President Zelensky and the top Ukrainian aides, was very  clear: ``I believe the Ukrainians became aware of the hold on August 29  and not before.''  This is all the House managers have in contrast to the testimony of  Volker, Taylor, Morrison, and Kent, the text from Yermak, the words of  the high-ranking Ukrainians themselves, and the flurry of activity that  began on August 28. That is the evidence that they want you to consider  as a basis to remove the duly elected President of the United States.  The bottom line is, it is not possible for the pause on security  assistance to have been used as leverage when President Zelensky and  other top Ukrainian officials did not know about it. That is what you  need to know. That is what the House managers didn't tell you.  The House managers know how important this issue is. When we briefly  mentioned it a few days ago, they told us we needed to check our facts.  We did. We are right. President Zelensky and his top aides did not know  about the pause on security assistance at the time of the July 25 call  and did not know about it until August 28, when the POLITICO article  was published.  We know there was no quid pro quo on the July 25 call. We know the  Ukrainians did not know the security assistance had been paused at the  time of the call. There is simply no evidence anywhere that President  Trump ever linked security assistance to any investigations.  Most of the Democrats' witnesses have never spoken to the President  at all, let alone about Ukraine security assistance. The two people in  the House's record who asked President Trump about whether there was  any linkage between security assistance and investigations were told,  in no uncertain terms, that there was no connection between the two.  When Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland asked the  President in, approximately, the September 9 timeframe, the President  told him, ``I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.''  Even earlier, on August 31, Senator Ron Johnson asked the President  if there were any connection between security assistance and  investigations. The President answered:  No way. I would never do that. Who told you that?  Two witnesses, Ambassador Taylor and Tim Morrison, said they came to  believe security assistance was linked to investigations, but both  witnesses based this belief entirely on what they had heard from  Ambassador Sondland before Ambassador Sondland spoke to [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S572\">Page S572</a>, ] the President. Neither Taylor nor Morrison ever spoke to the President  about the matter.  How did Ambassador Sondland come to believe that there was any  connection between security assistance and investigations? Again, the  House managers didn't tell you. Why not? In his public testimony,  Ambassador Sondland used variations of the words ``assume,''  ``presume,'' ``guess,'' ``speculate,'' and ``belief'' over 30 times.  Here are some examples.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador SONDLAND. That was my presumption, my personal   presumption.  That was my belief.  That was my presumption.  I presumed that might have to be done in order to get the   aid released.  It was a presumption.  I have been very clear as to when I was presuming, and I   was presuming on the aid.  It would be pure, you know, guesswork on my part,   speculation. I don't know.  That was the problem, Mr. Goldman. No one told me directly   that the aid was tied to anything. I was presuming it was.  Mr. Counsel PURPURA. They didn't show you any of this testimony--not  once--during their 21-hour presentation. It was 21 hours--more than 21  hours--and they couldn't give you the context to evaluate Ambassador  Sondland. All the Democrats have to support the alleged link between  security assistance and investigations is Ambassador Sondland's  assumptions and presumptions.  We remember this exchange.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)    ", "Ms. SPEIER": " Ms. SPEIER. Are you aware of any written product from the   National Security Council suggesting that investigations into   the 2016 election, the Bidens, or Burisma are part of the   official policy of the United States?  VINDMAN. No, I'm not.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Dr. Hill also elaborated on this point.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Dr. HILL. My point, Mr. Nunes, is that we at the National   Security Council were not told either by the President   directly or through Ambassador Bolton that we were to be   focused on these issues as a matter of U.S. foreign policy   towards Ukraine. So when we are talking about Ukraine in   2016, I never personally heard the President say anything   specific about 2016 and Ukraine. I've seen him say plenty of   things publicly, but I was not given a directive. In fact, I   was given a directive by Ambassador Bolton on July 10 very   clearly to stay out of domestic politics.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So, to be clear, when President Trump asked for  these investigations, he was not asking for them based on an official  U.S. policy. His top official advisers had not even been told about  these investigations. To the contrary, they were told to stay out of  U.S. politics.  And it gets worse. It was not just that President Trump ignored  official U.S. policy and the talking points he was given; it was that  what he was doing--withholding support from Ukraine--was actually  contrary to and harmful to U.S. policy.  There is clear and undisputed bipartisan support for Ukraine. Ukraine  is our ally. What is more, they are at war with our adversary, Russia.  So our goal should be to help President Zelensky's anti-corruption  reforms and to help Ukraine fight its adversary, Russia, in any way  that we can.  President Trump's own national defense strategy stated that the  United States and its European allies ``will deter Russian  adventurism''--a clear reference to Russia's usurpation of Ukrainian  territory and sovereignty. Consistent with that strategy, we currently  have approximately 68,000 troops stationed in Europe. Roughly 10,000 of  those U.S. troops are deployed on NATO's eastern border with Russia, to  countries like Poland, Hungary, Lithuania, and Bulgaria. These American  forces are literally holding the line against another land grab by  Vladimir Putin.  The author of that strategy, former U.S. National Security Advisor  LTG H.R. McMaster, issued this stark warning about Russia's aggression:  [F]or too long, some nations have looked the other way in   the face of these threats. Russia brazenly and implausibly   denies its actions and we have failed to impose sufficient   costs. The Kremlin's confidence is growing as its agents   conduct their sustained campaigns to undermine our confidence   in ourselves and in one another.  What General McMaster says obviously makes sense. Russia's  confidence, sadly, is growing. We need to stand up to them, and that is  why we support Ukraine, to help defeat Russian aggression.  So, on July 25, when President Zelensky spoke with President Trump,  that is what he, McMaster, was hoping to discuss--or he would be hoping  that he would discuss how we can support Ukraine in its fight against a  huge adversary.  Our confidence in one another; that is what President Zelensky was  most worried about when he got on the line with the President on July  25, whether Ukraine could have confidence in U.S. support.  Nearly 70 percent of Ukraine's territory--I am sorry. Nearly 7  percent of Ukraine's territory had been annexed by Russian-backed  forces. More than 15,000 troops have been lost in the hot war over the  past 5 years.  But when President Zelensky raised the issue of U.S. military aid  needed to confront Russian aggression, President Trump did nothing to  reassure the Ukrainian leader of our steadfast support for Ukraine's  sovereignty. Instead, he made personal demands.  It is for these reasons that President Trump's investigations went  against official U.S. policy. Witnesses confirmed that President  Trump's requests actually diverged not just from our policy but from  our own national security.  As Dr. Hill testified, Ambassador Sondland, in carrying out President  Trump's scheme, ``was being involved in a domestic political errand,  and we were being involved in national security policy, and those two  things had just diverged.''  And as Ambassador Taylor elaborated, ``[O]ur holding up of security  assistance that would go to a country that is fighting aggression from  Russia, for no good policy reason, no good substantive reason, no good  national security reason, is wrong.''  As these officials so correctly observed, there is no question that  President Trump's political errand and our national security diverged;  that he did this to advance his reelection, not to advance U.S.  national security goals, and that he did it for no good reason but the  political one.  But it is more than that. It is more than our national security  policy. We, as a country, are meant to embody the solution to  corruption. Our country is based on promoting the rule of law. And  here, what the President did attacks another of the U.S. strengths,  that of our ideals and our values.  Part of that is ensuring the integrity of our democracy and our  political institutions. It is a fundamental American value underlying  our democracy that we do not use official powers to ask for  investigations of our political opponents to gain a political  advantage.  When President Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate his  political opponent, he abused the broad authority provided to the  President of the United States.  Witness testimony again confirms this. Vice President Pence's  adviser, Jennifer Williams, was concerned by the President's focus on  domestic political issues rather than U.S. national security because  the President is not supposed to use foreign governments for political  errands.  She characterized the call as ``a domestic political matter.'' Here  is her testimony:  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Jennifer WILLIAMS. During my closed-door deposition,   members of the committee asked about my personal views, and   whether [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S502\">Page S502</a>, ]  I had any concerns about the July 25th call. As I testified   then, I found the July 25th phone call unusual because, in   contrast to other Presidential calls I had observed, it   involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic   political matter.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman also thought the call  was improper and unrelated to the talking points he had drafted for the  President.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Lt. Col. VINDMAN. It is improper for the President of the   United States to demand that a foreign government investigate   a U.S. citizen, and a political opponent . . .--it was also   clear that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the 2016   elections, the Bidens and Burisma, it would be interpreted as   a partisan play. This would undoubtedly result in Ukraine   using bipartisan support, undermining U.S. national security,   and advancing Russia's strategic objectives in the region.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, as a reminder, is a  Purple Heart veteran and says what we all know clearly: It is improper  for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government  to investigate a U.S. citizen and a political opponent.  And it wasn't just that Colonel Vindman thought it was wrong; he was  so concerned that he warned Ukraine, too, not to get involved in our  domestic politics.  In May, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman grew concerned by the pressure  campaign he witnessed in the media, waged primarily by Rudy Giuliani.  During a meeting with President Zelensky on May 20, Lieutenant Colonel  Vindman warned the Ukrainian leader to stay out of U.S. politics-- because that is our official U.S. policy.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Lieutenant Colonel VINDMAN. During a bilateral meeting in   which the whole delegation was meeting with President   Zelensky and his team, I offered two pieces of advice: To be   particularly cautious with regards to Ukraine--to be   particularly cautious with regards to Russia, and its desire   to provoke Ukraine; and the second one was to stay out of   U.S. domestic policy.  The CHAIRMAN. Do you mean politics?  Lieutenant Colonel VINDMAN. Politics, correct.  The CHAIRMAN. And why did you feel it was necessary to   advise President Zelensky to stay away from U.S. domestic   politics?  Lieutenant Colonel VINDMAN. Chairman, in the March and   April timeframe, it became clear that there were--there were   actors in the U.S., public actors, nongovernmental actors   that were promoting the idea of investigations and 2016   Ukrainian interference.  And it was consistent with U.S. policy to advise any   country, all the countries in my portfolio, any country in   the world, to not participate in U.S. domestic politics. So I   was passing the same advice consistent with U.S. policy.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. He once again makes this clear: ``[I]t was  consistent with U.S. policy to advise any country, all the countries in  my portfolio, any country in the world'' we do not participate in U.S.  domestic politics.  Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, too, testified that  the President's political investigations, of course, had nothing to do  with American anticorruption efforts in Ukraine, which has consistently  focused on building institutions and never specific investigations, and  that if we do ask countries to do our political errands, it entirely  threatens our credibility as a democracy.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  HECK. You also testified on October 15th, in the   deposition, about fundamental reforms necessary for Ukraine   to fight corruption and to transform the country. And you   cited the importance of reforming certain institutions,   notably the security service in the Prosecutor General's   Office. Was investigating President Trump's political   opponents a part of those necessary reforms? Was it on that   list of yours, sir? Or, indeed, was it on any list?  KENT. No, they weren't.  HECK. In fact, historically, is it not true that a major   problem in the Ukraine has been its misuse of prosecutors   precisely to conduct investigation of political opponents?   That's a legacy, I dare suggest, from the Soviet era, when,   as you stated in your testimony, prosecutors like the KGB   were and I quote you now ``instruments of oppression.'' Is   that correct?  KENT. I said that, and I believe it's true.  HECK. So, finally, Mr. Kent, for as long as I can remember,   U.S. foreign policy has been predicated on advancing   principled interests in democratic values--notably, freedom   of speech, press, assembly, religion; free, fair, and open   elections; and the rule of law. Mr. Kent, when American   leaders ask foreign governments to investigate their   potential rivals, doesn't that make it harder for us to   advocate on behalf of those democratic values?  KENT. I believe it makes it more difficult for our   diplomatic representatives overseas to carry out those policy   goals, yes.  HECK. How is that, sir?  KENT. Well, there's an issue of credibility. They hear   diplomats on the ground saying one thing, and they hear other   U.S. leaders saying something else.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The bottom line is this: What was in the best  interest of our country was to help Ukraine, to give them the military  aid, to fight one of our greatest adversaries, and to help promote the  rule of law. And what was in President Trump's personal interest was  the opposite: to pressure Ukraine to conduct investigations against his  2020 rival to help ensure his reelection. And when what is best for the  country and what was best for Donald Trump diverged, President Trump  put himself above the best interests of our country.  Let's now go to the fifth reason that we know the President put  himself first.  A fifth reason is that the request for these investigations departed  not just from U.S. policy but from established U.S. Government  channels.  On the July 25 call, President Trump told President Zelensky that he  should speak to Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General Barr, but after the  July 25 transcript was released, the Department of Justice disclaimed  any knowledge or involvement in the President's political  investigations.  The Department of Justice statement from the day the July 25 call was  released says this. This was from September 25.  (Text of Videotape presentation.)  The President has not spoken with the Attorney General   about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former   Vice President Biden or his son. The President has not asked   the Attorney General to contact Ukraine--on this or any other   matter. The Attorney General has not communicated with   Ukraine--on this or any other subject. Nor has the Attorney   General discussed this matter, or anything relating to   Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani.  Now, this is pretty extraordinary. You can say a lot of things about  the Attorney General, but you cannot say that he ever has looked to  pursue something he thought was not in the President's interest.  This is pretty extraordinary, where he is saying the moment this  transcript is publicly released: I have got nothing to do with this  scheme. I don't know why they brought me up in this call. I don't know  why the President brought me up in this call. He hasn't asked me to do  anything about this. I want nothing to do with this business.  I suspect the Attorney General can recognize a drug deal when he sees  it, too, and he wanted nothing to do with this.  Now, if this were some legitimate investigation, you would think the  Department of Justice would have a role. That is traditionally how an  investigation with an international component would work, but this  wasn't the case. This wasn't the case. And the Attorney General wanted  nothing to do with it.  If these were legitimate investigations that were in the national  interest, why was Bill Barr's Justice Department so quick to divorce  themselves from it?  The simple answer is that, as we see so clearly, they were against  U.S. official policy and our national security. The Justice Department  wanted nothing to do with it, and by asking for these investigations,  the President was abusing his power.  Let's go to the sixth reason you know President Trump put himself  first. It wasn't just that these witnesses told us--what these  witnesses told us in the impeachment hearings about this being wrong.  They reported the President's conduct in realtime. So it is not just  that they came forward later; they came forward in realtime to report  the President's conduct.  Of course, you have seen over the last couple days how many times  people are told: Go talk to the lawyers.  Well, Tim Morrison, former Republican staffer, and Colonel Vindman  were sufficiently concerned by what they heard President Trump solicit  on that July 25 call that they both immediately went to speak to the  lawyer, John Eisenberg, the NSC Legal Advisor. Let's take a look.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)    ", "Mr. TAYLOR": " Mr. TAYLOR. During our meeting, during our call on   September 8, Ambassador Sondland tried to explain to me that   President Trump is a businessman. When a businessman is about   to sign a check to someone who owes him something, the   businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the   check. Ambassador Volker used the same language several days   later while we were together at the Yalta European strategy   conference. I argued to both that the explanation made no   sense. Ukrainians did not owe President Trump anything.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. This is very telling. Ambassador Taylor, a  Vietnam veteran, a West Point graduate, said that Ukrainians didn't owe  us anything. Clearly, Donald Trump felt Ukrainians owed him, right?  This is not about Ukraine's national security. It is not about our  national security. It is not about corruption. No, it is about what is  in it for me. Those Ukrainians owe me before I sign a check.  And, by the way, that is not his money. That is your money. That is  the American people's money for their defense.  But here we see Ambassador Sondland explain: No, President Trump is a  businessman. Before he even signs a check, he wants to get something,  and, of course, that something he was going to sign that check for or  he was going to make that payment for, with our tax dollars--that thing  that he was going to buy with those tax dollars--was a smear of his  opponent and an effort to lift whatever cloud he felt was over his  Presidency because of the Russian interference on his behalf in the  last election.  The President has offered an assortment of shifting explanations  after the fact for the hold on aid, including that he withheld the  money because of corruption in Ukraine or concerns about burden-sharing  with other European countries. But those arguments are completely  without merit.  First, the President's own administration had determined by the time  of the hold that Ukraine had undertaken all necessary anti-corruption  and defense reforms in order to receive the funds. The Defense  Department and State Department officials repeatedly made this clear as  the hold remained and threatened the ability of the agency to spend the  money before the end of the fiscal year.  Second, the evidence revealed that the President only asked about the  foreign contributions to Ukraine in September, nearly 2 months after  the President implemented the hold and as it became clear that the  public, Congress, and a whistleblower were becoming aware of the  President's scheme.  The after-the-fact effort to come up with a justification also belies  the truth. The European countries provide far more financial support to  Ukraine than the United States. Their support is largely economic. Ours  also includes a lot of military support, but Europe is a substantial  financial backer of Ukraine.  There is something else remarkable about this that I was struck by  yesterday as we were going through the importance of the witness  testimony and looking at some of those redacted emails in which the  administration sought to hide its misconduct.  In those redactions, when we got to see what was beneath them, there  was an indication that this is very close-hold. This is a need-to-know  basis only. Do you remember that? We will show you that again, but it  is one of those emails that only came to light, I believe, recently,  and it is not because the administration wanted you to see this  information. We see there is a desire not to let people know about this  hold.  If the President were fighting corruption, if he wanted Europeans to  pay more, why would he hide it from us? Why would he hide it from the  Ukrainians? Why would he hide it from the rest of the world? If this  were a desire for Europe to pay more, why wouldn't he charge Sondland  to go ask Europe for more? Why wouldn't he be proud to tell the  Congress of the United States: I am holding up this aid, and I am  holding it up because I am holding up corruption?  Why wouldn't he? Because, of course, it wasn't true. There is no  evidence of that.  And, once more, the White House admitted why the President held up  the money. The President's own Chief of Staff explained precisely why  during the October 17 press conference. Let's see, again, what he had  to say.  (Text of Videotape presentation.)    ", "Mr. HOLMES": " Mr. HOLMES. And although the hold on the security   assistance may have been lifted, there were still things they   wanted that they weren't getting, including a meeting with   the President in the Oval Office. Whether the hold, the   security assistance hold continued or not, the Ukrainians   understood that that's something the President wanted and   they still wanted important things from the President. That   continues to this day. We have to be very careful. They still   need us now going forward.  In fact, right now President Zelensky is trying to arrange   a summit meeting with President Putin in the coming weeks,   his first face-to-face meeting with him to try to advance the   peace process. He needs our support. He needs President Putin   to understand that America supports Zelensky at the highest   levels. So this doesn't end with the lifting of the security   assistance hold. Ukraine still needs us, and as I said, still   fighting this war this very day.  Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Let's evaluate exactly how President Trump made  clear to Ukraine that a White House meeting was conditioned on Ukraine  announcing two phony political investigations that would help with  President Trump's reelection in 2020--help him cheat and corrupt our  democracy.  By the end of May, it was clear that President Trump's pressure  campaign to solicit foreign election interference wasn't working.  President Zelensky had been elected and was rebuffing Mr. Giuliani's  overtures. Even when President Trump directed his official staff to  work with Mr. Giuliani in an effort to get President Zelensky to  announce the two phony political investigations, that didn't work. So  President Trump apparently realized that he had to increase the  pressure. That is when he explicitly made clear to Ukraine that it  would not get the desperately sought after Oval Office meeting unless  President Zelensky publicly announced the phony investigations that  President Trump sought.  On July 2, 2019, Ambassador Volker personally communicated the need  for investigations directly to President Zelensky during a meeting in  Toronto.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador VOLKER. After weeks of reassuring the Ukrainians   that it was just a scheduling issue, I decided to tell   President Zelensky that we had a problem with the information   reaching President Trump from Mayor Giuliani. I did so in a   bilateral meeting at a conference on Ukrainian economic   reform in Toronto on July 2, 2019, where I led the U.S.   delegation.  I suggested that he call President Trump directly in order   to renew their personal relationship and to assure President   Trump that he was committed to investigating and fighting   corruption, things on which President Zelensky had based his   Presidential campaign. I was convinced that getting the two   Presidents to talk with each other would overcome the   negative perception of Ukraine that President Trump still   harbored.  Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. After Ambassador Volker instructed President  Zelensky in Toronto on what to do, he updated Ambassador Taylor on his  actions. He told Ambassador Taylor that he had counseled the Ukrainian  President on how to ``prepare for the phone call with President  Trump.'' He also told Ambassador Taylor that he advised Zelensky that  President Trump ``would like to hear about the investigations.''  In addition to Ambassador Volker's direct outreach to President  Zelensky, Ambassador Sondland continued to apply pressure as well  during two White House meetings that took place on July 10 with  Ukrainian officials. The first meeting included National Security  Advisor John Bolton, Dr. Fiona Hill, LTC Alexander Vindman, Secretary  Rick Perry, Ambassador Volker, as well as Bolton's Ukrainian  counterpart and Ukrainian Presidential aide Andriy Yermak.  After discussion on Ukraine's national security reform plans,  Ambassador Sondland broached the subject of the phony political  investigations.  Fiona Hill, who also attended the meeting, recalled that Ambassador  Sondland blurted out the following in that meeting with the Ukrainians:  ``Well, we have an agreement with the Chief of Staff for a meeting if  these investigations in the energy sector start.'' That is code for  Burisma, which is code for the Bidens.  Ambassador Volker also recalled that Ambassador Sondland raised the  issue of the 2016 election and Burisma investigations. Ambassador  Volker found Ambassador Sondland's comments in that meeting to be  inappropriate.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador VOLKER. I participated in the July 10 meeting   between National Security Advisor Bolton and then-Chairman of   the National Security Defense Council, Alex Danyliuk. As I   remember, the meeting was essentially over when Ambassador   Sondland made a general comment about investigations. I think   all of us thought it was inappropriate.  Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. The exchange underscores that by early July,  President Trump's demand for investigations had come to totally  dominate almost every aspect of U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine.  Securing a Ukrainian commitment to do investigations was a major  priority of senior U.S. diplomats, as directed by President Donald John  Trump.  The July 10 meetings also confirmed that the scheme to pressure  Ukraine into opening investigations was not a rogue operation but one  blessed by senior administration officials at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  As Ambassador Sondland testified, ``Everyone was in the loop.''  Mr. Majority Leader, based on the statement that we should break at  around 6:30 p.m., I ask your indulgence. This may be a natural breaking  point in connection with my presentation.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader.    ", "Mr. SONDLAND": " Mr. SONDLAND. I first communicated with Mr. Giuliani in   early August, several months later. Mr. Giuliani emphasized   that the President wanted a public statement from President   Zelensky committing Ukraine to look into the corruption   issues. Mr. Giuliani specifically mentioned the 2016   election, including the DNC server, and Burisma as two topics   of importance to the President.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Giuliani exerted significant influence in this  process. In fact, when on August 4 Yermak inquired again about the  Presidential meeting, Ambassador Volker turned not to the National  Security Council staff or to the State Department to arrange it and  follow up. He turned to Giuliani again. Volker told Yermak that he  would speak with Giuliani later that day and would call the Ukrainian  President's aide afterward.  Volker then texts Giuliani to ask about the Madrid meeting and to set  up the call that he had mentioned to Yermak. Giuliani replies that the  meeting with Yermak was excellent and that he would call later. Phone  records obtained by the committees show a 16-minute call on August 5  between Ambassador Volker and Giuliani. Ambassador Volker then texts  Yermak:  Hi, Andriy. Had a good, long talk with Rudy. Call anytime.   Kurt.  Separately, Volker told Ambassador Sondland: ``Giuliani was happy  with that meeting and it looks like things are turning around''--a  reference to Volker's hope that satisfying Giuliani would break down  President Trump's reservations concerning Ukraine.  But things had not turned around by the end of that first week of  August, by August 7. The aid was still on hold, and there had been no  movement on setting a date for the White House meeting.  Ambassador Volker then reaches out to Giuliani to try to get things  moving. Ambassador Volker texts Giuliani to recommend that he report to  ``the boss,'' meaning President Trump, about his meeting with Yermak in  Madrid. Specifically, he wrote--this is Volker writing to Giuliani:  Hi, Rudy. Hope you made it back safely. Let's meet if you   are coming to DC. It would be good if you could convey   results of your meeting in Madrid to the boss so we can get a   firm date for the visit.  So this is Ambassador Volker following up with Giuliani. Giuliani has  met with the top aide to the President of Ukraine in Madrid. He wants  Giuliani to convey to the boss--to Trump--how good that meeting in  Madrid was about the investigations so they can get the President of  Ukraine in the door at the White House.  Now, think about how unusual this is. This is the President's  personal lawyer, who is on this personal mission on behalf of his  client to get these investigations in Ukraine. The President of Ukraine  can't get in the door of the Oval Office. And who are they going to?  Are they going to the Security Council? No. Are they going to the State  Department? No. They tried all that. They are going to the President's  personal lawyer. Does that sound like an official policy to try to  fight corruption?  Why would you go outside of the normal channel to do that? You  wouldn't. You would go to your personal attorney, who is on a personal  mission that he admits is not foreign policy, when your objective has  nothing to do with policy, when your objective is a corrupt one.  What does that mean, to have a corrupt objective? It means an illicit  one. It means an impermissible one. It means one that furthers your own  interests at the cost of the national interests--the willingness to  break the law, like the Impoundment Control Act, by withholding aid is  indicative of that corrupt purpose, the lengths the President would go,  not in furtherance of U.S. policy but against U.S. policy, not even a  difference on policy at all.  The mere pursuit of personal interest, the pursuit of an illegal  effort to get foreign interference, is the very embodiment of a corrupt  intent.  Here we are, August 7. Volker is saying: Rudy, if you are coming to  DC, let's get together. It would be good if you can talk to the boss  because we can't get a meeting another way.  Around that time, Ambassador Volker received a text message from  Yermak, who asked him--and this is Yermak asking Volker:  Hi Kurt. How are you? Do you have some news about White   House meeting date?  Volker responds:  Not yet--I texted Rudy earlier to make sure he weighs in   following your meeting. Gordon--  Meaning Sondland.  should be speaking with the president on Friday. We are   pressing this.  There is Gordon Sondland, who is ``pressing this.'' This is the man  you have heard from already--Gordon Sondland, the man who says: It was  absolutely a quid pro quo. You have asked about a quid pro quo. There  was a quid pro quo about this White House meeting.  This is what they are talking about right here. Gordon will be  ``speaking with the president on Friday. We are pressing this.''  Ambassador Volker's contact with Giuliani spurred a flurry of  communications. The patterns of calls from August 8 strongly suggest  Giuliani was attempting to call the White House to speak to a senior  White House official, left a message, then had a 4-minute call with  that official later that night.  We don't know from the call records who that White House official  was, but recall that Giuliani has publicly stated that when he spoke to  the White House, he usually spoke to President Trump, his client.  Also, on August 8, Yermak texts Volker that he had some news.  Ambassador Volker replies that he can talk then, and Ambassador Volker  updates Giuliani in a text the next day.  Volker says to Giuliani in the text:  Hi Mr. Mayor! Had a good chat with Yermak last night. He   was pleased with your phone call. Mentioned--  He is referring to President Zelensky here.  making a statement. Can we all get on the phone to make sure   I advise--  Here he is referring to President Zelensky.  correctly as to what he should be saying? Want to make sure   we get this done right.  Here, August 9, there is an effort by Volker to make sure to get this  statement right about the investigations. If they can't get the  statement right, you aren't going to get in the door of the Oval  Office.  It also makes clear who is exactly in charge of this, and that is  Rudy Giuliani. Ambassador Volker is checking with Rudy Giuliani about  what he should advise President Zelensky. We know that Giuliani is  taking his orders from President Trump.  Text messages and call records obtained by the committees show that  Ambassador Volker and Giuliani connected by phone twice around noon on  August 9 for several minutes each.  Following the calls with Giuliani, Ambassador Volker created a three- way group chat using WhatsApp and included himself, Ambassador  Sondland, and Yermak. Ambassador Volker initiated the chat a round 2:20  that day. This is Volker chatting with Sondland and Yermak. It is a  three-way chat.  Volker says:  Hi, Andrey--  Meaning Yermak.  We have all consulted here, including with Rudy. Can you do   a call later today or tomorrow your afternoon time?  Sondland says:  I have a call [scheduled] at 3 pm Eastern for the three of   us. Ops will call.  Call records obtained by the committees show that on August 9  Ambassador Sondland twice connected with phone lines associated with  the White House--once in the early afternoon for about 18 minutes and  once in the late afternoon for about 2 minutes. We know that Ambassador  Sondland had direct access to President Trump.  After all this activity, Ambassador Sondland and Volker thought they  had a breakthrough--finally, a breakthrough. Minutes after this call,  which was likely with Tim Morrison about a possible date for the White  House meeting, Ambassador Volker and Sondland discussed the agreement  they believed they had reached and started with Sondland in this text  message:  Morrison ready to get dates as soon as Yermak confirms. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S473\">Page S473</a>, ]  Volker says:  Excellent!! How did you sway him?  Sondland says:  Not sure I did. I think potus really wants the deliverable.  We know what that ``deliverable'' is. It is the political  investigations.  Volker says:  But does he know that?  And Sondland says:  Yep. Clearly lots of convos--  Meaning conversations.  going on.  Volker says:  OK--then that's good it's coming from two separate sources.  Ambassador Sondland told the committees that the deliverable required  by President Trump was a press statement from President Zelensky  committing to do the investigations into the Bidens and the allegation  of Ukraine election interference that President Trump mentioned on July  25. But Tim Morrison testified that he didn't know anything about the  deliverable; he was just involved in trying to schedule the White House  meeting, which everyone wanted to schedule as a sign of support for  President Zelensky and our ally Ukraine. But Trump's agents wouldn't  just accept Ukraine's word for it.  Ambassador Sondland then recommended to Ambassador Volker that Yermak  share a draft of the press statement to ensure that the statement would  comport with the President's expectations.  Here, on August 9--we are still less than 2 weeks after the July 25  call; I guess we are about 2 weeks--Sondland says in this message:  To avoid misunderstandings, might be helpful to ask Andrey   for a draft statement (embargoed) so that we can see exactly   what they propose to cover. Even though Ze--  Referring to Zelensky.  does a [live] presser they can still summarize in a brief   statement. Thoughts?  And Volker says:  Agree!  At his deposition, Ambassador Sondland said that he suggested  reviewing a written summary of the statement because he was concerned  that President Zelensky would say whatever he would say on live  television, and it still wouldn't be good enough for Rudy/the  President.  Yermak, in turn, was concerned that the announcement would still not  result in the coveted White House meeting. On August 10, Yermak texted  Volker, attempting to schedule a White House meeting before the  Ukrainian President made a public statement in support of the  investigations into Burisma and the 2016 election.  You can see what is going on here. The President and his agent,  Giuliani, want this public statement of the investigations before they  will give a date. And the Ukrainians want a date before they have to  commit to making public they are going to do the investigations.  So you have had this standoff where each is trying to get the  deliverable first, but there is no debate about what the deliverable is  on either side. There is no debate about the quid pro quo here: You  give me this; I will give you that. You give me the White House  meeting; I will give you the public announcement of the investigation  into your political rival.  No, no, no. You give me the announcement of the investigation into my  rival, and then I will give you the meeting.  The only debate here is about which comes first.  August 10, Yermak texts Volker:  I think it's possible to make this declaration and mention   all these things. Which we discussed yesterday. But it will   be logic to do after we receive a confirmation of date. We   inform about date of visit about our expectations and our   guarantees for future visit. Let discuss it.  Ambassador Volker responded that he agreed but that first they would  have to iron out a statement and use that to get a date, after which  President Zelensky would give the statement. The two decided to have a  call the next day and to include Ambassador Sondland.  Yermak texts Ambassador Volker:  Excellent.  Once we have a date, will call for a press briefing,   announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot   of the US-UKRAINE relationship, including, among other   things, Burisma and election meddling in investigations.  Yermak was also in direct contact with Ambassador Sondland regarding  this revised approach. In fact, he sent Ambassador Sondland the same  text message.  Ambassador Sondland kept the leadership of the State Department in  the loop. On August 10, he told Ambassador Volker that he had reported  to T. Ulrich Breckbull, Counselor of the Department of State, who,  Sondland testified, frequently consulted with Secretary Pompeo.  Sondland wrote to Volker: I briefed Ulrich. All good. So Ulrich is in  the loop.  Sondland and Volker continued to pursue the statement from Zelensky  on the investigations. The next day, Ambassador Sondland emails  Breckbull and Lisa Kenna, the State Department's Executive Secretary,  about efforts to secure a public statement and a big presser from  President Zelensky.  Sondland hoped it might ``make the boss happy enough to authorize an  invitation.''  After first being evasive on the topic, Secretary Pompeo has  subsequently acknowledged that he listened in on the July 25 call.  Since he was on the call, Pompeo must have understood what would make  the boss--that is, the President--happy enough to schedule a White  House meeting.  Again, everyone was in the loop. On August 11, Ambassador Volker sent  Giuliani a text message. This is Volker to Giuliani:  Hi Rudy--we have heard bCk [sic] from Andrey again--they   are writing the statement now and will send it to us. Can you   talk for 5 min before noon today?  And Giuliani says:  Yes just call.  That is August 11.  On the next day, August 12, Yermak sent Ambassador Volker an initial  version of the draft statement by text. Notably, as we saw earlier,  this statement from the Ukrainians doesn't explicitly mention Burisma,  Biden, or 2016--election investigations that the President has been  seeking.  You can see what is going on here now. There was this game of  chicken.  You go first.  No, we'll go first. You give us the date, and we will give you the  statement.  No, you give us the statement, and we will give you the date.  And now, realizing, OK, they have to give the statement first,  Ukraine tries to give them a generic statement that doesn't really go  into specifics about these investigations. And why? You can imagine  why. Ukrainians don't want to have to go out in public and say they are  going to do these investigations, because they are not stupid, because  they understood this would pull them right into U.S. Presidential  politics. It was intended to, which isn't in Ukraine's interests. It is  not in our interests either, and Ukraine understood that. And so they  resisted.  First they resisted having to do the public statement, and then they  wanted to make sure they got the deliverable, and then, when they had  to make the statement, they didn't want to be specific--for one thing,  for another thing. This was what Zelensky campaigned on. He was going  to fight corruption. He was going to end political investigations, so  he didn't want to be specific.  He sends this statement that doesn't have the specific references.  Ambassador Volker explained during his testimony that was not what  Giuliani was requesting, and it would not satisfy Giuliani or Donald  Trump.  Presumably, if the President was interested in corruption, that  statement would have been enough. But all he was interested in was an  investigation or an announcement of an investigation into his rival and  this debunked theory about 2016.  The conversation that Volker referred to in his earlier testimony  took place on the morning of August 13, when Giuliani made clear that  the specific investigations related to Burisma--code for Bidens--and  the 2016 election had to be included in order to get the White House  meeting.  The Americans sent back to the Ukrainian top aide a revised draft  that includes now the two investigations. You have seen the side-by- side. This was then the essence of the quid pro quo regarding the  meeting. This direction came from President Trump. Here is how  Ambassador Sondland put it. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S474\">Page S474</a>, ]  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador SONDLAND. Mr. Giuliani's requests were a quid   pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President   Zelensky. Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public   statement announcing the investigations of the 2016 election   DNC server and Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the   desires of the President of the United States, and we knew   these investigations were important to the President.  According to witness testimony, as you might imagine, Ukrainian  officials were very uncomfortable with a draft that Giuliani, Volker,  and Sondland were negotiating. They understood that the statement was  the deliverable that President Trump wanted, but yielding to President  Trump's demands would, in essence, force President Zelensky to break  his promise to the Ukrainian people to root out corruption because  politically motivated investigations are the hallmark of the kind of  corruption that Ukraine has been plagued with in the past.  Mr. Yermak tried to get some confirmation that the requested  investigations were legitimate. Yermak asked Volker ``whether any  request had ever been made by the U.S. to investigate election  interference in 2016''; in other words, whether any request had been  made by any official U.S. law enforcement agency through formal  channels as you would expect if it were a legitimate request.  Ambassador Volker, trying to find a satisfactory answer, on August  15, Volker's assistant asked Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent  whether there was any precedent for such a request for investigations.  At his deposition, Kent testified that ``if you're asking me, have we  ever gone to the Ukrainians and asked them to investigate or prosecute  individuals for political reasons, the answer is, I hope we haven't,  and we shouldn't because that goes against everything that we are  trying to promote in the post Soviet states for the last 28 years,  which is promotion of the rule of law.''  We are now on the next day, August 16. In a conversation with  Ambassador Bill Taylor, the U.S. Ambassador in Kyiv--Ambassador Taylor  stepped in when Ambassador Yovanovitch was pushed out--Taylor  ``amplified the same theme'' and told Kent that ``Yermak was very  uncomfortable'' with the idea of investigations and suggested it should  be done officially and put in writing.  As a result, it became clear to Kent in mid-August that Ukraine was  being pressured to conduct politically motivated investigations. Kent  told Ambassador Taylor: ``That's wrong, and we shouldn't be doing that  as a matter of U.S. policy.''  Ambassador Volker claimed that he stopped pursuing the statement from  the Iranians around this time because of the concerns raised by  Zelensky's aide. At his deposition and despite all his efforts to  secure a statement announcing these very specific political  investigations desired by the President, Ambassador Volker testified  that he agreed with Yermak's concerns and advised him that making those  specific references was not a good idea because making those statements  might look like it would play into our domestic politics.  Without specific references to the politically damaging  investigations that Trump demanded, the agreement just wouldn't work.  Ukraine did not release the statement and, in turn, the White House  meeting was not scheduled. As it turns out, Ambassadors Sondland and  Volker did not achieve the breakthrough after all.  Let's go into what finally breaks the logjam because that involves  the military aid. With efforts to trade a White House meeting for a  press statement announcing the investigations temporarily scuttled,  Sondland and Volker go back to the drawing board. On August 19,  Ambassador Sondland told Volker that he drove the larger issue home  with Yermak, President Zelensky's top aide, particularly that this was  now bigger than a White House meeting--bigger than just the White House  meeting and was about the relationship per se. It is not just about the  meeting anymore; it is about everything.  By this time in late August, the hold on security assistance had been  in place more than a month, and there was still no credible explanation  offered by the White House despite some, like Ambassador Sondland,  repeatedly asking. There were no interagency meetings since July 31,  and the Defense Department had withdrawn its assurances that it could  even comply with the law, which, indeed, it couldn't. Every agency in  the administration opposed the hold. As the Government Accountability  Office confirmed, concerned DOD and OMB officials had been right that  the President's holding of the aid was an unlawful act, but President  Trump was not budging.  At the same time, despite the persistent efforts of numerous people,  President Trump refused to schedule the coveted White House visit with  President Zelensky until the investigations were announced that would  benefit his campaign.  Here is what Ambassador Sondland said about the hold on funds and its  link to the politically motivated investigations in Ukraine.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador SONDLAND. In the absence of any credible   explanation for the suspension of aid, I later came to   believe that the resumption of security aid would not occur   until there was a public statement from Ukraine committing to   the investigations of the 2016 elections and Burisma, as Mr.   Giuliani had demanded.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. From the Embassy in Kyiv, David Holmes reached  the same conclusion--a conclusion as simple as two plus two equals  four.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  GORDON. Mr. Holmes, you have testified that by late August,   you had a clear impression that the security assistance hold   was somehow connected to the investigations that President   Trump wanted. How did you conclude--how did you make--reach   that clear conclusion?  Ambassador HOLMES. Sir, we've been hearing about the   investigation since March--months before--and President   Zelensky had received a congratulatory letter from the   president saying he would be pleased to meet him following   his inauguration in May.  And we had been unable to get that meeting. And then the   security hold came up with no explanation.  And I'd be surprised if any of the Ukrainians--we discussed   earlier, you know, they're sophisticated people--when they   received no explanation for why that hold was in place,   they would have drawn that conclusion.  GORDON. Because the investigations were still being   pursued?  Ambassador HOLMES. Right.  GORDON. And the hold was still remaining without   explanation?  Ambassador HOLMES. Right.  GORDON. So this to you was the only logical conclusion that   you could reach?  Ambassador HOLMES. Right.  GORDON. Sort of like 2 plus 2 equals 4?  Ambassador HOLMES. Exactly.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Sondland explained the predicament he believed he  faced with a hold on aid to Ukraine.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador SONDLAND. As my other State Department   colleagues have testified, this security aid was critical to   Ukraine's defense and should not have been delayed. I   expressed this view to many during this period, but my goal   at the time was to do what was necessary to get the aid   released, to break the logjam. I believed that the public   statement we have been discussing for weeks was essential to   advancing that goal.  You know, I really regret that the Ukrainians were placed   in that predicament, but I do not regret doing what I could   to try to break the logjam and to solve the problem.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. On August 22, Ambassador Sondland tried to break  that logjam, as he put it, regarding both the security assistance hold  and the White House meeting. Ambassador Sondland described those  efforts in his public testimony. Let's listen to him again.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador SONDLAND. In preparation for the September 1   Warsaw meeting, I asked Secretary Pompeo whether a face-to-  face conversation between Trump and Zelensky would help to   break the logjam. This was when President Trump was still   intending the travel to Warsaw.  Specifically, on August 22nd, I emailed Secretary Pompeo   directly, copying Secretariat Kenna. I wrote--and this is my   email to Secretary Pompeo. Should we block time in Warsaw for   a short pull-aside for POTUS to meet Zelensky? I would ask   Zelensky to look him in the eye and tell him that once   Ukraine's new justice folks are in place in mid-September,   that Zelensky--he, Zelensky, should be able to move forward   publicly and with confidence on those issues of importance to   POTUS in the U.S. Hopefully, that will help break the logjam.  The secretary replied, yes.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Sondland also explained that both he and  Secretary Pompeo understood that issues of importance to the President  were the two [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S475\">Page S475</a>, ] sham investigations the President wanted to help his reelection  efforts. And that reference to the logjam meant both the security  assistance and the White House meeting.  At the end of August, National Security Advisor John Bolton arrived  in Ukraine for an official visit. David Holmes took notes in Bolton's  meeting and testified about Ambassador Bolton's message to the  Ukrainians.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador HOLMES. Shortly thereafter, on August 27th,   Ambassador Bolton visits Ukraine and brought welcome news   that President Trump had agreed to meet President Zelensky on   September 1st in Warsaw.  Ambassador Bolton further indicated that the hold on   security assistance would not be lifted prior to the Warsaw   meeting, where it would hang on whether President Zelensky   was able to ``favorably impress President Trump.''  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Let's think about that for a minute--unless you  have something further to say. Let's think about that for a minute.  Bolton further indicated that the hold on security assistance would not  be lifted prior to the Warsaw meeting where it would hang on whether  President Zelensky was able to ``favorably impress'' President Trump.  What do you think would favorably impress President Trump? What were  the only two things that President Trump asked of President Zelensky?  What were the two things that Rudy Giuliani was asking of President  Zelensky and his top aides? What would favorably impress Donald Trump?  Would Donald Trump be favorably impressed if President Zelensky were  to tell him about this new corruption court or new legislation in  Marada or how negotiations with the Russians were going or how they are  bringing about defense reform?  Had any of those things ever come up in any of these text messages,  any of these emails, any of these phone calls, any of these  conversations? Of course not. Of course not. There was only one thing  that was going to favorably impress President Trump in Warsaw, and that  is if Zelensky told him to his face: I am going to do these political  investigations. I don't want to do them. You know I don't want to do  them. I resisted doing them, but I am at war with Russia, and I can't  wait anymore. I can't wait anymore. I am sure that would have impressed  Donald Trump.  But the meeting between the two Presidents never happened in Warsaw.  President Trump canceled the trip at the last moment. Before Bolton  left Kyiv, Ambassador Taylor asked for a private meeting. Ambassador  Taylor explained that he was extremely concerned about the hold on  security assistance. He described the meeting to us during his  testimony.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador TAYLOR. Near the end of Ambassador Bolton's   visit, I asked to meet him privately, during which I   expressed my serious concern about the withholding of   military assistance to Ukraine while the Ukrainians were   defending their country from Russian aggression. Ambassador   Bolton recommended that I send the first-person cable to   Secretary Pompeo directly, relaying my concerns.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Now, in the State Department, sending a first- person cable is an extraordinary step. State Department cables are  ordinarily written in the third person, as Ambassador Taylor testified  at his deposition. Sending a first-person cable gets attention because  there are not many first-person cables that come in. In fact, in his  decades of diplomatic service, he had never written a single one until  now.  Taylor sent that cable on August 29. Would you like me to read that  to you right now? I would like to read it to you right now, except I  don't have it because the State Department wouldn't provide it, but if  you would like me to read it to you, we can do something about that. We  can insist on getting that from the State Department. If you would like  to know what John Bolton had in mind when he thought that Zelensky  could favorably impress the President in Warsaw, we can find that out,  too, just for the asking in a document called a subpoena.  Taylor sends that cable on August 29. The State Department did not  provide that cable to us in response to a subpoena, but witnesses who  reviewed it described it as a powerful message that described the  folly--the folly--of withholding military aid from Ukraine at a time  when it was facing incursion from Russian forces in eastern Ukraine.  That cable also sought to explain that U.S. assistance to Ukraine was  vital to U.S. national security as well.  Now, why don't they want you to see that cable? Maybe they don't want  you to see that cable because that cable from a Vietnam veteran  describes just how essential that military assistance was not just to  Ukraine; maybe they don't want you to see that cable because it  describes just how important that military assistance is to us--to us.  The President's counsel would love you to believe that this is just  about Ukraine. You don't need to care about Ukraine. Who cares about  Ukraine? How many people can find Ukraine on a map? Why should we care  about Ukraine? Well, we should care about Ukraine. They are an ally of  ours. If it matters to us, we should care about the fact that, in 1994,  we asked them to give up their nuclear weapons that they had inherited  from the Soviet Union, and they didn't want to give them up, and we  were worried about proliferation.  We said: Hey, if you give them up, which you don't want to do because  you are worried the Russians might invade if you give them up, we will  help assure your territorial integrity.  We made that commitment. I hope we care about that. I hope we care  about that because they did give them up.  And do you know what? Just what they feared took place--the Russians  moved across their border, and they remain an occupied party in  Ukraine. That is the word of America we gave, and we are breaking that  word. Why? For help on a political campaign?  Ambassador Taylor was exactly right. That is crazy. It is worse than  crazy. It is repulsive. It is repugnant. It breaks our word. To do it  in the name of these corrupt investigations is also contrary to  everything we espouse around the world.  I used to be part of a commission in the House on democracy  assistance, where we would meet with parliamentarians, and I know my  Senate colleagues do much the same thing. We would urge our colleagues  to observe the rule of law, not to engage in political investigations  and prosecutions. I don't know how we make that argument now. I don't  know how we look our allies or these burgeoning democracies in the face  or our fellow parliamentarians and make that argument now. I wouldn't  make that argument now.  Testimony indicated that Secretary Pompeo eventually carried that  cable into the White House, but there is no evidence that those  national security concerns that they don't want you to see were able to  outweigh the President's personal interest in his getting foreign help  in his reelection campaign. There is no evidence at all.  Now we get to August 28.  POLITICO was the first to publicly report that President Trump had  implemented a hold on nearly $400 million of U.S. military assistance  to Ukraine that had been appropriated by Congress. Now that the worst  kept secret was public, Ukrainian officials immediately expressed their  alarm and concern to their American counterparts.  As witnesses explained, the Ukrainians had two serious concerns.  One, of course, was the aid itself, which was vital to their ability  to fight off Russia. In addition, they were worried about the symbolism  of the hold; that it signaled to Russia and Vladimir Putin that the  United States was wavering in its support for Ukraine. Witnesses  testified that this was a division that Russia could and would exploit  to drive a further wedge between the United States and Ukraine to its  advantage.  The second concern was likely why Ukrainian officials had wanted the  hold to remain a secret in the first place--because it would add to the  negative impact to Ukraine if the hold itself became public. It is bad  enough that the President of the United States put a hold on their aid.  It was going to be far worse if it became public as, indeed, it did.  Andriy Yermak, the same Zelensky aide, sent Ambassador Volker a link  to the POLITICO story and then texted: ``Need to talk with you.''  Other Ukrainian officials also expressed concerns to Ambassador  Volker [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S476\">Page S476</a>, ] that the Ukrainian Government was being singled out and penalized for  some reason.  Well, what do we think that reason was? Why were they being singled  out? Why was that country being singled out? That was the one country  that this President could lever for help against an opponent he feared.  That is why Ukraine was being singled out.  On August 29, Yermak also contacted Ambassador Taylor. Yermak said  the Ukrainians were very concerned about the hold on military  assistance. He said that he and other Ukrainian officials would be  willing to travel to Washington to explain to its officials the  importance of this assistance.  Ambassador Taylor, who was on the ground in Ukraine, explained the  Ukrainian viewpoint and, frankly, their desperation.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador TAYLOR. In September, the Minister of Defense,   for example, came to me--I would use the word--``desperate''   to figure out why the assistance was being held. He thought   that perhaps, if he went to Washington to talk to you--to   talk to the Secretary of Defense, to talk to the President--  he would be able to find out and reassure--provide whatever   answer was necessary to have that assistance released.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Without any official explanation for the hold,  American officials could provide little reassurance to their Ukrainian  counterparts. It has been publicly reported that President Trump,  Secretary Esper, and Secretary Pompeo met in late August and that they  all implored the President to release the aid, but President Trump  continued to refuse to release the aid.  As of August 30, the President was clearly directing the OMB to  continue the hold on security assistance. In documents reviewed by just  security but withheld from the Congress by the OMB on the President's  instructions, OMB official Michael Duffey emailed DOD Comptroller  Elaine McCusker that there is ``clear direction from POTUS to continue  the hold.''  So here we are on August 30. A month after that July 25 call, aid is  still being withheld. Ukrainians are still holding on, still not  willing to capitulate, not willing to violate Zelensky's whole campaign  pledge about not engaging in corrupt investigations.  On that same day, August 30, Republican Senator Ron Johnson spoke  with Ambassador Sondland to express his concern about President Trump's  decision to withhold military assistance to Ukraine. Senator Johnson  described that call in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.  According to Senator Johnson, Ambassador Sondland told him that if  Ukraine would commit to ``get to the bottom of what happened in 2016-- if President Trump has that confidence--then he will release the  military spending.''  Senator Johnson added:  At that suggestion, I winced. My reaction was, ``Oh, God. I   don't want to see those two things combined.''  The next day, August 31, Senator Johnson spoke by phone with  President Trump regarding the decision to withhold aid to Ukraine.  According to the Wall Street Journal, President Trump denied the quid  pro quo that Senator Johnson had learned of from Ambassador Sondland.  At the same time, however, President Trump refused to authorize Senator  Johnson to tell Ukrainian officials on his upcoming trip to Kyiv that  the aid would be forthcoming.  The message that Ambassador Sondland communicated to Senator Johnson  mirrored that used by President Trump during the July 25 call with  President Zelensky in which President Trump twice asked the Ukrainian  leader to get to the bottom of it, including in connection to an  investigation into the debunked conspiracy theory of Ukrainian  interference in the 2016 election. It also mirrored the language of the  text message that Ambassador Volker sent to President Zelensky's aide  just before the July 25 call.  Indeed, despite the President's self-serving denials, the message was  clear: President Trump wanted the investigations, and he would withhold  not one but two acts vested in him by the power of his office in order  to get them.  Now begins September, September 1.  The President was supposed to go to Warsaw, as we know, but he does  not go to Warsaw. Mike Pence goes to Warsaw. Jennifer Williams, the  special adviser to the Vice President for Europe and Russia, learned of  the change in the President's travel plans on August 29. The Vice  President's National Security Advisor asked, at the request of Vice  President Pence, for an update on the status of the security assistance  that had just been publicly revealed in POLITICO and would be a  critical issue during the bilateral meeting between the Vice President  and President Zelensky in Warsaw.  The delegation arrived in Warsaw and gathered in a hotel room to  brief Vice President Pence before he met with the Ukrainian President.  National Security Advisor Bolton led the meeting.  As Williams described it, advisers in the room ``agreed on the need  to get a final decision on security assistance as soon as possible so  that it could be implemented before the end of the year, but Vice  President Pence did not have authority from the President to release  the aid.''  Ambassador Sondland also attended that briefing. At the end of it, he  expressed concern directly to Vice President Pence about the security  assistance being held until the Ukrainians announced the very same  politically motivated investigations at the heart of this scheme.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Chairman SCHIFF. You mentioned that you also had a   conversation with Vice President Pence before his meeting   with President Zelensky in Warsaw and that you raised a   concern you had, as well, that the security assistance was   being withheld because of the President's desire to get a   commitment from Zelensky to pursue these political   investigations. What did you say to the Vice President?  Ambassador SONDLAND. I was in a briefing with several   people, and I just spoke up, and I said: It appears that   everything is stalled until this statement gets made. It was   something--words to that effect. That's what I believe to be   the case based on, you know, the work that the three of us   had been doing--Volker, Perry, and myself--and the Vice   President nodded like, you know, he heard what I said, and   that was pretty much it as I recall.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Everyone was in the loop. Ambassador Sondland  testified that Vice President Pence was neither surprised nor dismayed  by the description of this quid pro quo.  At the beginning of the bilateral meeting between President Zelensky  and Vice President Pence, as expected, the first question from  President Zelensky related to the status of the security assistance.  As Vice President Pence's aide Jennifer Williams testified, President  Zelensky explained that just equally with the financial and fiscal  value of the assistance, that it was the symbolic nature of that  assistance that really was the show of U.S. support for Ukraine and for  Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.  Later that day, Vice President Pence spoke to the President about his  meeting with President Zelensky, but the hold on security assistance  remained in place well after Vice President Pence returned from Warsaw.  After the Warsaw meeting with Vice President Pence, Ambassador  Sondland quickly pulled aside Andriy Yermak, Zelensky's top aide, and  informed him that the aid would not be forthcoming until Ukraine  publicly announced the two investigations that President Trump wanted.  So here we are, after the meeting--right after the meeting. They are  still in Warsaw, and Zelensky pulls aside his Ukrainian counterpart,  Yermak, and explains the aid is not coming until the investigations are  announced.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador SONDLAND. Based on my previous communication   with Secretary Pompeo, I felt comfortable sharing my concerns   with Mr. Yermak. It was a very, very brief, pulled aside   conversation that happened within a few seconds. I told Mr.   Yermak that I believed that the resumption of U.S. aid would   likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on   the public statement that we have been discussing for many   weeks.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Let's let that sink in for a minute too.  You have heard my colleagues at the other table say: Ukrainians felt  no pressure. There is no evidence they felt any pressure.  Of course, we have already had testimony about how they did feel  pressure, and they didn't want to be drawn into this political  campaign. You saw over [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S477\">Page S477</a>, ] and over in these text messages and emails: No, you go first. You  announce. No, you go first. Yet we are supposed to believe they felt no  pressure? There it is. It breaks out into the open. The military aid is  being withheld, and there is a connection between the holding of the  military aid and these investigations.  The first thing they are asking about--and they send the copy of the  article--is: What is happening with this aid? They are ready to come to  DC to plead for the aid. They go to Warsaw. They meet with the Vice  President. The first question is the aid.  And what happens after that meeting? Now, that was a big meeting, by  the way, with the Vice President and the Ukrainian delegation. It is  not likely, in front of all of those people, the Vice President is  going to bring it up.  So Sondland goes up to his counterpart right after that, on the  sidelines of that meeting, and he says basically: Ya ain't getting the  money until you do the investigations.  And we are to believe they felt no pressure? Folks, they are at war.  They are at war, and they are being told: You are not getting $400  million in aid you need unless you do what the President wants, and  what the President wants are these two investigations.  If you don't believe that is pressure, that is $400 million worth of  pressure, I got a bridge I want to sell you.  It is hard for to us put ourselves in the Ukrainians' position. I  mean, imagine if the eastern third of our country were occupied by an  enemy force, and we are beholden to another country for military aid,  and they are saying: You are not going to get it until you do what we  want. Do you think we would feel pressure? I think we would feel  pressure, and that is exactly the situation the Ukrainians were in.  You heard the other counsel say before: Well, but they say they don't  feel pressure--like they are going to admit they were being shaken down  by the President of the United States. You think they feel pressure  now, you should see what kind of pressure they would feel if they  admitted that.  Tim Morrison, the NSC official, witnessed the conversation between  Sondland and Yermak from across the room and immediately thereafter  received the summary from Ambassador Sondland. He reported the  substance of that conversation to his boss, Ambassador Bolton. He told  Morrison to ``consult with the lawyers.'' Go talk to the lawyers.  You know, if you keep getting told you got to go talk to the lawyers,  there is a problem. If things are perfect, you don't get told ``go talk  to the lawyers'' time and again.  Morrison confirmed that he did talk to the lawyers, in part to ensure  there was a record of what Ambassador Sondland was doing. That record  exists within the White House. Would you like me to read you that  record? I would be happy to read you that record. It is there for your  asking. Of course the President has refused to provide that record.  Precisely why did Ambassador Bolton direct Morrison to tell the  lawyers, talk to the lawyers? Would you like Ambassador Bolton to tell  you why he said that? He would be happy to tell you why he said that.  He is there for your asking.  What did Bolton know about the freeze in aid prior to this meeting in  Warsaw? What did he mean that he can press Zelensky--it is going to  depend on whether you can press Zelensky? Would you like to know what  that meant? I would like to know what he meant by that. I think we know  what he meant by that.  Tim Morrison also conveyed the substance of the Sondland-Yermak pull- aside to his colleague Ambassador Taylor. So this is now Tim Morrison  told by Bolton ``go talk to the lawyers,'' and he talks to, also,  Ambassador Taylor, our Ambassador in Ukraine.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador TAYLOR. On the evening of September 1st, I   received a readout of the Pence-Zelensky meeting over the   phone from Mr. Morrison during which he told me that   President Zelensky had opened the meeting by immediately   asking the Vice President about the security cooperation. The   Vice President did not respond substantively but said that he   would talk to President Trump that night. The Vice President   did say that President Trump wanted the Europeans to do more   to support Ukraine and that he wanted the Ukrainians to do   more to fight corruption.  During the same phone call with Mr. Morrison, he described   the conversation Ambassador Sondland had with Mr. Yermak in   Warsaw. Ambassador Sondland told Mr. Yermak that the security   assistance money would not come until President Zelensky   committed to pursue the Burisma investigation.  I was alarmed by what Mr. Morrison told me about the   Sondland-Yermak conversation.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Ambassador Taylor then explained why he was so  alarmed by this turn. Let's hear that as well.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)    ", "Mr. MULVANEY": " Mr. MULVANEY. Did he also mentioned to me in the past the   corruption that related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no   question about that. But that's it, and that's why we held up   the money.  Ms. Manager LOFGREN. After this really stunning admission, the House  issued a subpoena to require Mr. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S549\">Page S549</a>, ] Mulvaney to testify, but on the day of Mr. Mulvaney's scheduled  deposition, the White House sent a letter to his personal attorney. It  prohibited him from obeying the subpoena. The letter said: ``The  President directs Mr. Mulvaney not to appear at the Committee's  scheduled deposition.''  When he issued this order, President Trump doubled down on his  previous blanket order. He did so after the House voted to approve  resolution 660, which in no uncertain terms made clear that Mr.  Mulvaney was being subpoenaed to testify in an impeachment  investigation.  This order was the first of many. President Trump also ordered  another White House official, Robert Blair, not to testify. Mr. Blair  is Mr. Mulvaney's senior adviser and his closest aide. He was involved  in communications about the hold on Ukraine aid.  The day after his initially scheduled deposition, Mr. Blair's  personal attorney sent a letter to the House. It said: ``Mr. Blair has  been directed by the White House not to appear and testify.''  The House also wanted testimony from John Eisenberg, the senior  attorney on President Trump's National Security Council. As you have  heard over the past few days, key witnesses, including Dr. Hill and  Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, said they were concerned by President  Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine. They were told to report these  concerns to Mr. Eisenberg.  The day before his scheduled deposition, the White House sent a  letter to Mr. Eisenberg's personal attorney. It said: ``The President  directs Mr. Eisenberg not to appear at the Committee's deposition.''  Now, that language is starting to sound familiar.  Mr. Eisenberg's personal attorney then sent a letter to the House.  The letter said this:  Under these circumstances, Mr. Eisenberg has no other   option that is consistent with his legal and ethical   obligations except to follow the direction of his client and   employer, the President of the United States. Accordingly,   Mr. Eisenberg will not be appearing for a deposition at this   time.  Now, that language, I think, is important. And it is telling. It  shows that President Trump's order left Mr. Eisenberg with ``no other  option that is consistent with his legal and ethical obligations.'' By  directing him to defy a lawful subpoena, President Trump created a  legal and ethical problem for Mr. Eisenberg.  I am sure you know, contempt of Congress can be punished as a  criminal offense. It carries the possible sentence of up to 12 months  in jail. No President has ever dared, during an impeachment inquiry, to  officially and explicitly order government witnesses to defy House  subpoenas. You don't have to consider high-minded constitutional  principles to understand why this was wrong. It is simple, really. By  ordering specific government officials to defy congressional subpoenas,  President Trump forced those officials to choose between submitting to  the demands of their boss or breaking the law. Nobody should abuse a  position of power in that way. But President Trump specifically ordered  all three of these senior White House officials--Mulvaney, Blair, and  Eisenberg--to defy the House's subpoenas and refuse to testify.  President Trump's efforts to conceal his actions didn't stop there,  and they didn't stop at the front door of the White House. No less than  12 other witnesses were specifically ordered not to testify. One of  those witnesses, Ulrich Brechbuhl, hasn't been highlighted much over  the past few days, but the way he fits into the story is worth noting.  Mr. Brechbuhl is a senior official at the State Department. Like  these other senior officials, he was ordered not to testify. In a  letter to the House, his attorney said: ``Mr. Brechbuhl has received a  letter of instruction from the State Department directing that he not  appear.'' Mr. Brechbuhl is still another person who could shed light on  President Trump's actions. He was kept updated on Rudy Giuliani's  broader efforts in Ukraine. He had firsthand knowledge of Secretary  Pompeo's involvement. For one thing, he handled Ambassador  Yovanovitch's recall from Ukraine, though he refused to meet with her  in the aftermath.  Also, messages by Ambassador Volker show that Mr. Brechbuhl knew  about Mr. Giuliani's efforts in Ukraine as they occurred. On July 10,  Ambassadors Taylor, Volker, and Sondland discussed Rudy Giuliani's push  abroad. While discussing the problems Rudy was creating by meddling in  official U.S. foreign policy, Ambassador Taylor noted that he ``briefed  Ulrich this afternoon.'' Also on August 11, Ambassador Sondland emailed  Mr. Brechbuhl to ask him to brief Secretary Pompeo in the statement he  was negotiating with President Zelensky, the aim of ``making the boss  happy enough to authorize an invitation.''  Ambassador Sondland wrote to him:  Kurt and I negotiated a statement from Z to be delivered   for our review in a day or two. The contents will hopefully   make the boss happy enough to authorize an invitation.  Now, State Department Executive Secretary Lisa Kenna answered  Ambassador Sondland several hours later, letting him know that she  passed that information on to Secretary Pompeo. Let's pause here and  consider why this message to Mr. Brechbuhl, which the State Department  continues to conceal, is important. In this exchange, Ambassador  Sondland told Brechbuhl that he had negotiated a deal to get President  Zelensky to make a statement and that Sondland hoped that the promised  statement would ``make the boss happy enough to authorize an  invitation.''  It shows that senior State Department leadership, including Secretary  Pompeo, was quite aware of the deal to trade an invitation to the White  House for a statement from President Zelensky.  Indeed, Ambassador Sondland confirmed that he kept them in the loop.  Here is his testimony:  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador SONDLAND. We kept the leadership of the State   Department and the NSC informed of our activities, and that   included communications with Secretary of State Pompeo; his   counselor, Ulrich Brechbuhl; his Executive Secretary, Lisa   Kenna; and also communications with Ambassador Bolton, Dr.   Hill, Mr. Morrison, and their staff at the NSC. They knew   what we were doing and why.  Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Eight other witnesses were also ordered not to  testify as part of the House's impeachment inquiry, but those eight  witnesses came forward anyway, despite the President's efforts to  prevent them from testifying. All of the following witnesses were told  not to testify: Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, Ambassador Gordon  Sondland, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, Ambassador  Bill Taylor, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper, Deputy  Associate Director at OMB Mark Sandy, State Department official  Catherine Croft, and State Department official Christopher Anderson.  Each of these eight witnesses followed the law. They obeyed House  subpoenas, and they testified before the House.  In all, we know that by issuing the blanket order and later specific  orders, President Trump prevented at least 12 current or former  administration officials from testifying during the House's impeachment  inquiry. He specifically forced nine of those witnesses to defy duly  authorized subpoenas.  The facts are straightforward, and they are not in dispute:  First, in the history of our Republic, no President ever dared to  issue an order to prevent even a single government witness from  testifying in an impeachment inquiry.  Second, President Trump abused the power of his office by using his  official power in an attempt to prevent every single person who works  in the executive branch from testifying before the House.  Finally, President Trump's orders, in fact, prevented the House from  obtaining key witness testimony from at least 12 current or former  government officials.  President Trump's orders were clear; they were categorical; they were  indiscriminate; and they were wrong. They prevented key government  witnesses from testifying. There is no doubt. That is obstruction,  plain and simple.  Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief Justice, now let us turn to some  final sets of facts. In a further effort to silence his administration,  President Trump engaged in a brazen effort to publicly attack and  intimidate the dedicated public servants who came forward to testify.  To be clear, these [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S550\">Page S550</a>, ] witnesses didn't seek the spotlight in this way. For years, they had  quietly and effectively performed their duties on behalf of our  national interest and on behalf of the American people.  Why would they seek the spotlight in this way, knowing that the  President of the United States would lead the chorus of attacks against  them. And he did. In response, the President issued threats, openly  discussed possible retaliation, attacked their character and  patriotism, and subjected them to mockery and other insults--the  President. The President's attacks were broadcast to millions of  Americans, including the witnesses, their families, their friends, and  their coworkers. This campaign of intimidation risked discouraging  witnesses from coming forward voluntarily or complying with mandatory  subpoenas for documents and testimony. And, as we all know, witness  intimidation is a Federal crime.  There is simply not enough time today to walk through each of the  President's attacks on the House's witnesses, but let's talk about a  few. As I am sure my colleagues recall, the House subpoenaed Ambassador  Marie Yovanovitch for public testimony. Ambassador Yovanovitch's first  tour was in Somalia, an increasingly dangerous place as that country's  civil war progressed. During a different tour, Ambassador Yovanovitch  helped to open a U.S. Embassy, during which time the Embassy was  attacked by a gunman who sprayed the Embassy building with gunfire.  Ambassador Yovanovitch has also served as an ambassador to Armenia and  served the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. As Chairman Schiff said earlier, she  has served in some dangerous places around the world on behalf of our  interests and the interests of the American people.  President Trump's Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs  described Ambassador Yovanovitch as ``an exceptional officer, doing  exceptional work at a critical embassy in Kyiv.'' But during Ambassador  Yovanovitch's public testimony, President Trump tweeted:  Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started   off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to   Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably   about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S.   President's absolute right to appoint ambassadors.  In that same hearing, Chairman Schiff asked Ambassador Yovanovitch  for her reactions to the President's attacks during her testimony  before the House. Let's listen to that exchange.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)    ", "Ms. SEWELL": " Ms. SEWELL. What do you think he meant by his   characterization of Giuliani as a hand grenade?  Ms. Hill. What he meant by this was pretty clear to me in   the context of all of the statements that Mr. Giuliani was   making publicly about the investigations that he was   promoting, that the story line he was promoting, the   narrative he was promoting was going to backfire. I think it   has backfired.  Mr. Manager NADLER. In June, as Ambassador Bolton became aware of Mr.  Giuliani's coordination with Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, he told  Dr. Hill and other members of the National Security Council staff that  ``nobody should be meeting with Giuliani.'' But, he, of course, did not  know of the President's plot as to why people were meeting with  Giuliani.  Dr. Hill also testified that Ambassador Bolton was ``closely  monitoring what Mr. Giuliani was doing and the messaging that he was  sending out.'' But Ambassador Bolton was keenly aware that Mr. Giuliani  was doing the President's bidding. That is also why the President fears  his testimony.  During a meeting on June 13, 2019, Ambassador Bolton made clear that  he supported more engagement with Ukraine by senior White House  officials but questioned that ``Mr. Giuliani was a key voice with the  president on Ukraine.'' He joked that every time Ukraine is mentioned,  Giuliani pops up.  Ambassador Bolton also communicated directly with Mr. Giuliani at key  junctures. According to call records obtained by the House, Mr.  Giuliani connected with Ambassador Bolton's office three times for  brief calls between April 23 and May 10, 2019, a time period that  corresponds with the recall of Ambassador Yovanovitch and the  acceleration of Mr. Giuliani's efforts on behalf of President Trump to  pressure Ukraine into opening investigations that would benefit his  reelection campaign.  For instance, on April 23, the day before the State Department  recalled Ambassador Yovanovitch from Ukraine, Mr. Giuliani had an 8- minute 28-second call from the White House. Thirty minutes later, he  had a 48-second call with a phone number associated with Ambassador  Bolton.  If he were called to testify, we could ask Ambassador Bolton directly  what transpired on that call and whether that phone call informed his  assessment that Mr. Giuliani was ``a hand grenade that was going to  blow everyone up.'' We can ask Mr. Bolton why, when there are  approximately 1.8 million companies in Ukraine--several hundred  thousand of which have been accused of corruption--the President was  focused on only one. He didn't care about anything else. He cared only  about the company on which the former Vice President's son had been a  board member. Can you believe that he was concerned with corruption and  only knew about one company, when there are hundreds of thousands that  were accused of corruption?  Although Ambassador Bolton did not listen in on the July 25 call  between President Trump and President [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S425\">Page S425</a>, ] Zelensky in which President Trump asked the Ukrainian President a  favor--a favor to investigate one company and Joe Biden's son--we have  learned from witness testimony that Ambassador Bolton was opposed to  scheduling the call in the first place. Why? Because he accurately  predicted, in the words of Ambassador Taylor, that ``there could be  some talk of investigations or worse on the call.'' In fact, he did not  want the call to happen at all because he ``thought it was going to be  a disaster.''  How did Ambassador Bolton know that President Trump would bring this  up? What made him so concerned that a call would be a disaster? I think  we know, but only Ambassador Bolton can answer these questions.  Based on extensive witness testimony, we also know that throughout  this period, multiple people on the National Security Council's staff  reported concerns to Ambassador Bolton about tying American foreign  policy to President Trump's ``domestic political errand,'' as Dr. Hill  so aptly put it.  After he abruptly ended the July 10 meeting--the meeting in which  Ambassador Sondland abruptly told the Ukrainians that a White House  meeting could be scheduled in exchange for the announced  investigations--Ambassador Bolton spoke to Dr. Hill and directed her to  report her concerns to National Security Council's legal adviser John  Eisenberg.  At the end of August, Ambassador Bolton advised Ambassador Taylor to  send a first-person cable to Secretary Pompeo to relay concerns about  the hold on the military aid.  Ambassador Bolton also advised Mr. Morrison--Dr. Hill's successor as  the top Russia and Ukraine official on the National Security Council-- on at least two different occasions to report what he had heard to the  National Security Council's lawyers, it sounding so suspicious.  On September 1, Ambassador Bolton directed Mr. Morrison to report to  the National Security Council's lawyers an explicit proposal from  Ambassador Sondland to a senior Ukrainian official that ``what could  help them move the aid was if the prosecutor general would go to the  mike and announce that he was opening the Burisma investigation.''  On September 7, Ambassador Bolton instructed Mr. Morrison to report  to the lawyers another conversation Mr. Morrison had with Ambassador  Sondland. This time, Ambassador Sondland had conveyed that the  administration would not release the military aid unless President  Zelensky announced the investigations demanded by President Trump--the  investigations of one company because the President was so concerned  about the corruption in Ukraine. It was one company that had had Vice  President Biden's son on the board, and the President just happened to  pick that company from hundreds of thousands to be concerned about  corruption. And the President also opposed funding for corruption aid  to Ukraine.  Why did Ambassador Bolton tell his subordinates to report these  issues to the national security lawyers? What does he know about how  the lawyers responded to the concerns of Dr. Hill or of Lieutenant  Colonel Vindman and Mr. Morrison? Again, only Ambassador Bolton can  answer these questions, and we must assume that the answers go to the  heart of the President's misconduct, given the President's attempt to  block his testimony. Why would the President oppose the testimony of  his own appointee as the National Security Advisor of the United States  unless he knew that testimony would be damming to him? Those are other  reasons the President fears Ambassador Bolton's testimony.  I would like to now turn to Ambassador Bolton's knowledge of and  concerns about President Trump's illegal withholding of the military  aid to Ukraine.  Of course, we all know that under the Anti-Impoundment Act of 1974-- passed to prevent President Nixon from refusing to spend money  appropriated by Congress--withholding money appropriated by Congress is  illegal; nonetheless, the President did it for obviously corrupt  motives.  By July of last year, Ambassador Bolton was well aware that President  Trump was illegally withholding security assistance to Ukraine, and he  and his subordinates tried to convince the President to pursue  America's national security interests and release the aid instead of  continuing to withhold vital military assistance to the President-- instead of holding that vital military assistance hostage to the  President's personal political agenda.  Throughout the rest of July, over the course of several interagency  meetings, the National Security Council repeatedly discussed the freeze  on Ukraine's security assistance. As National Security Advisor,  Ambassador Bolton supervised that process. These meetings worked their  way up to the level of Cabinet deputies, and every agency involved,  except for the Office of Management and Budget, supported releasing the  aid. OMB, meanwhile, said its position was based on President Trump's  express orders.  We know that a number of individuals at OMB and the Department of  Defense raised serious concerns about the legality of freezing the  funds, which we know is illegal. We now have an explicit ruling from  the Government Accountability Office, which we didn't need because we  knew that is why the law was passed in 1974, that the freeze ordered by  President Trump was illegal--and he was obviously told this--and  violated the Impoundment Control Act.  We also know that after the meeting of Cabinet deputies on July 26,  Tim Morrison talked to Ambassador Bolton, and according to Mr.  Morrison, Ambassador Bolton said that the entire Cabinet supported  releasing the freeze and wanted to get the issue to President Trump as  soon as possible.  When did Ambassador Bolton first become aware that President Trump  was withholding military aid to Ukraine and conditioning the release of  that aid on Ukraine announcing political investigations? What was he  told was the reason? What else did he learn about the President's  actions in these meetings? Again, only Ambassador Bolton can answer  these questions, and again we must presume that President Trump is  desperate for us not to hear those answers. I hope not too many of the  Members of this body are desperate to make sure that the American  people don't hear these same answers.  We know that Ambassador Bolton tried throughout August, without  success, to persuade the President that the aid to Ukraine had to be  released because that was in America's best interest and necessary for  our national security.  In mid-August, we know Lieutenant Colonel Vindman wrote a  Presidential decision memorandum recommending that the freeze be lifted  based on the consensus views of the entire Cabinet. The memo was given  to Ambassador Bolton, who subsequently had a direct, one-on-one  conversation with the President in which he tried but failed to  convince him to release the hold.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)    ", "Mr. SWALWELL": " Mr. SWALWELL. We don't have time to screw around.  Speaker PELOSI. It's about urgency.    ", "Mr. MORRISON": " Mr. MORRISON. Correct.  Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Everyone who knew something about it and who  testified agreed there was no malicious intent. The call was still  available to everyone who needed it as part of their job, and it  certainly wasn't covered up or deep-sixed in some way. The President  declassified it and made it public. So why we are even here talking  about these accusations about a coverup, when it is a transcript that  was preserved and made public, is somewhat absurd.  The other point I would like to turn to--another accusation from the  House managers--is that the whistleblower complaint was not forwarded  to Congress. They have said that lawyers at the Department of Justice,  this time, they accused OLC, the Office of Legal Counsel, of providing  a bogus opinion for why the Director of National Intelligence did not  have to advance the whistleblower's complaint to Congress.  Manager Jeffries said that OLC opined ``without any reasonable basis  that the Acting DNI did not have to turn over the complaint to  Congress.''  The way he portrayed this--now, there is a statute that says if the  inspector general of the intelligence community finds a matter of  urgent concern, it must be forwarded to Congress. And Manager Jeffries  portrayed this as if the only thing to decide was were these claims  urgent. He said: ``What can be more urgent than a sitting President  trying to cheat in an American election by soliciting foreign  interference?''  Except that is not the only question. The statute doesn't just say,  if it is urgent, you have to forward it. It talks about ``urgent  concern'' as a defined term. If the House managers want to come and  cast accusations that the political and career officials at the Office  of Legal Counsel, which we all know is a very respected office of the  Department of Justice, provides opinions for the executive branch on  what governing law is, they should come backed up with analysis.  So let's look at what the law actually says, and I think we have the  slide of that.  ``Urgent concern is defined as a serious or flagrant problem, abuse,  violation of law relating to the funding, administration, or operation  of an intelligence activity within the responsibility and authority of  the Director of National Intelligence involving classified  information.''  So the Office of Legal Counsel was consulted by the General Counsel  at [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S622\">Page S622</a>, ] the DNI's office, and they looked at this definition, and they did an  analysis. They determined that the alleged misconduct was not an urgent  concern within the meaning of the statute because they were not just  talking about ``Do we think it is urgent?'' ``Do we think it is  important?'' No. They were analyzing the law, and they looked at the  terms of the statute.  ``The alleged misconduct is not an urgent concern within the meaning  of the statute because it does not concern the funding, administration,  or operation of an intelligence activity under the authority of the  DNI.''  Remember, what we are talking about here is a head-of-state  communication between the President of the United States and another  head of state. This isn't some CIA operation overseas. This isn't the  NSA's doing something. This isn't any intelligence activity going on  within the intelligence community under the supervision of the DNI. It  is the head of the executive branch, in the exercising of his  constitutional authority, engaging in foreign relations with a foreign  head of state.  So, in reaching that conclusion, the Office of Legal Counsel looked  at the statute, case law, and the legislative history. It concluded  that this phrase ``urgent concern'' included matters relating to an  intelligence activity subject to the DNI's supervision, but it did not  include allegations of wrongdoing arising outside of any intelligence  activity or outside the intelligence community itself.  That makes sense. This statute was meant to provide for an ability of  the inspector general's of the intelligence community, in overseeing  the activities of the intelligence community, to receive reports about  what was going on at intelligence agencies, those who were members of  the intelligence community, and if there were fraud, waste, abuse-- something unlawful--in those activities. It was not meant to create an  inspector general of the Presidency, an inspector general of the Oval  Office, to purport to determine whether the President, in exercising  his constitutional authorities, had done something that should be  reported.  This law is narrow, and it does not cover every alleged violation of  law, the OSC explained, or other abuse that comes to the attention of a  member of the intelligence community. Just because you are in the  intelligence community and happen to see something else doesn't make  this law apply. The law does not make the inspector general for the  intelligence community responsible for investigating and reporting on  allegations that do not involve intelligence activities or the  intelligence community.  Nonetheless, the President, of course, released the July 25 call  transcript, and it was also not the end of the matter that the  whistleblower complaint and the ICIG's letter were not sent directly to  Congress. As the OLC explained, if the alleged complaint does not  involve an urgent concern but if there is anything else there that you  want to have checked out, the appropriate action is to refer the matter  to the Department of Justice, and that is what the DNI's office did.  They sent the ICIG's letter, with the complaint, to the Department of  Justice, and the Department of Justice looked at it. This was all made  public some time ago. The Department of Justice examined the exact  allegations of the whistleblower's and the exact framing and concern  raised by the inspector general, which had to do with the potential of,  perhaps, a campaign finance law violation. The DOJ looked at it--looked  at the statutes, analyzed it--and determined there was no violation,  and it closed the matter. It announced that months ago.  When something gets sent over to the Department of Justice to  examine, you can't call that a coverup. Everything here was done  correctly. The lawyers analyzed the law. The complaint was sent to the  appropriate person for review. It was not within the statute that it  required transmission to Congress. Everything was handled entirely  properly.  Again, actually extraneous to the matters before you, there is  nothing about these two points in the Articles of Impeachment, but it  merits a response when reckless allegations are made against those at  the White House and at the Department of Justice.  With that, Mr. Chief Justice, I yield my time to Mr. Sekulow.  Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Majority Leader  McConnell, Democratic Leader Schumer, House managers, Members of the  Senate.  What we are involved in here, as we conclude, is perhaps the most  solemn of duties under our constitutional framework--the trial of the  leader of the free world and the duly elected President of the United  States. It is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts. That is  politics, unfortunately, and Hamilton put impeachment in the hands of  this body--the Senate--precisely and specifically to be above that  fray. This is the greatest deliberative body on Earth.  In our presentation so far, you have now heard from legal scholars  from a variety of schools of thought, from a variety of political  backgrounds, but they do have a common theme with a dire warning-- danger, danger, danger. To lower the bar of impeachment based on these  Articles of Impeachment would impact the functioning of our  constitutional Republic and the framework of that Constitution for  generations.  I asked you to put yourselves--in quoting Mr. Schiff's statement that  his father made--in the shoes of someone else, and I said I would like  you to put yourselves in the shoes of the President. I think it is  important, as we conclude today, that we are reminded of that fact.  The President of the United States, before he was the President, was  under an investigation. It was called Crossfire Hurricane. It was an  investigation, led by the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  James Comey eventually told the President a little bit about the  investigation and referenced the Steele dossier. James Comey, the then- Director of the FBI, said it was salacious and unverified--so salacious  and unverified that they used it as a basis to obtain FISA warrants.  Members--managers here, managers at this table right here--said that  any discussions on the abuse from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Act, utilized to get the FISA warrants from the court, were conspiracy  theories.  At the very beginning, I asked you to put yourselves in the shoes of  not just this President but of any President who would have been under  this type of attack. FISA warrants were issued on people affiliated  with his campaign--American citizens affiliated with the people of his  campaign, citizens of the United States being surveilled pursuant to an  order that has now been acknowledged by the very court that issued the  order that it was based on a fraudulent presentation.  In fact, evidence specifically changed--changed by the very FBI  lawyer who was in charge of this, changed to such an extent that the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court--as I said earlier, and I will  not repeat it again--issued two orders, saying that when this agent-- this lawyer--made these misrepresentations to the National Security  Division, they also made a misrepresentation to a Federal court--the  Federal court--the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. This is a  court where there are no defense witnesses and is a court where there  is no cross-examination. It is a court based on trust. That trust was  violated.  Then the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James  Comey, decides he will leak a memo of a conversation he had with the  President of the United States. He is leaking the memo for a purpose,  he said--to obtain the appointment of a special counsel. Lo and behold,  a special counsel is appointed. It just so happens that that FBI  agent--lawyer--who committed the fraud on the FISA Court, became a  lawyer for the Mueller investigation, only to be removed because of  political animus and bias found by the inspector general.  Then we have a special counsel investigation. Lisa Page, Agent  Strzok--I am not going to go into the details. You know them. They are  not in controversy. They are uncontroverted. The facts are clear. But  does it bother your sense of justice even a little bit--even a little  bit--that Bob Mueller allowed the evidence on the phones of those  agents to be wiped clean while there was an investigation going on by  the inspector general? [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S623\">Page S623</a>, ]  Now, if you did it, or if you did it, Manager Schiff, or if you did  it, Manager Jeffries, or if I did that--destroyed evidence--if anyone  in this Chamber did this, we would be in serious trouble. Their serious  trouble is their getting fired. Bob Mueller's explanation for it is, I  don't know what happened. I don't know what happened. I can't recall  conversations.  You can't view this case in a vacuum. You are being asked--and I say  this with the utmost respect--to remove a duly elected President of the  United States. We have referenced the law school exams, and I love  that. I thought there was great analysis yesterday. I appreciate all of  that, but I want to focus today on my section, on what you are being  asked to do. You are being asked to remove a duly elected President of  the United States, and you are being asked to do it in an election  year--in an election year.  There are some of you in this Chamber right now who would rather be  someplace else, and that is why we will be brief. I understand. You  would rather be someplace else. Why would you rather be someplace else?  Because you are running for President, for the nomination of your  party. I get it, but this is a serious, deliberative situation. You are  being asked to remove a duly elected President of the United States.  That is what the Articles of Impeachment call for--removal.  So we had a special counsel, and we got the report. Just for a  moment, putting yourselves in the shoes of this President--or of any  President who would be under this situation--you are No. 4 at the  Department of Justice. His wife is working for the firm that is doing  the opposition research on him and is communicating with the foreign  former spy, Christopher Steele, who put together the dossier. It is  being handled by Christopher Steele, through Nellie Ohr, to her  husband--then, the fourth ranking member at the Department of Justice,  Bruce Ohr. All of this is going on, and he doesn't want to tell  everybody--and he has testified to this--what he is doing because he is  afraid he might have to stop.  Might have to stop?  How did this happen? This is the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And  then we ask why the President is concerned about advice he is being  given?  Put yourself in his shoes. Put yourself in his shoes.  We have given you--and our approach has been to give--an overview,  and to be very specific, to remove a duly elected President, which is  what you are being asked to do, for essentially policy disagreements-- you heard a lot about policy, although the one that I still--it still  troubles me, this idea that the President--it was said by several of  the managers--is only doing these things for himself.  Understanding what is going on in the world today, as we are here-- they raised it, by the way. I am not trying to be disrespectful. They  raised it: This President is only doing things for himself while the  leaders of opposing parties, by the way, at the highest level, to  obtain peace in the Middle East--to say you are only doing that for  yourself? I think the irony is that those statements were made while  all of that was going on and other acts that this body has passed, some  of them bipartisan, to help the American people.  Policy differences--those policy differences cannot be used to  destroy the separation of powers. House managers spoke for--I know we  have had disagreements on the time. It was 21 hours or 23 hours. They  spoke during their time--a lot of time--most of it attacking the  President, policy decisions. They didn't like what they heard. They  didn't like there was a pause on foreign aid.  I have laid out before that there were pauses on all kinds of foreign  aid. He is not the first President to do it.  But the one thing I am still trying to understand from the managers'  perspective--and maybe it is not fair to ask the managers because you  are not the leader of the House. But remember the whole idea that this  was a dire national security threat, a danger to our Nation, and we had  to get this over here right away. It had to be done before Christmas.  It was so important; it was so significant; the country was in such  jeopardy; the jeopardy was so serious that it had to be done  immediately.  Let's hold on to the Articles of Impeachment for a month to see if  the House could force the Senate to adopt rules that they wanted, which  is not the way the Constitution is set up.  But it was such a dire emergency, it was so critical for our Nation's  national interests, that we could hold them for 33 days. Danger,  danger, danger. That is politics.  As I said, you are being called upon to remove the duly elected  President of the United States. That is what these Articles of  Impeachment call for.  They never really answered the question of why they thought there was  such a national emergency. Maybe they will during questions; I don't  know. If there was such a national emergency, they never did explain  why it was that they waited. They certainly didn't wait to have the  proceedings, as my colleagues have laid out; I mean, those proceedings  moved in record time. I suspect that we have been here more than the  House actually considered the actual Articles of Impeachment.  Is that the way the Constitution is supposed to work? Is that the  design of the Constitution?  And then their question, of course, came up yesterday on the whole  situation with Burisma and the Bidens and that whole issue, and my  colleague went through that a great deal, and I am not going to do  that.  But do we have a--we used to call this, in free speech cases, like a  free speech zone. You could have your free speech activities over here;  you can't have them over there. Do you we have like a Biden-free zone?  Was that was this was? You mention someone or you are concerned about a  company, and it is now off limits? You can impeach the President of the  United States for asking a question? I think we significantly showed  the question.  I am not going to go through a detail-by-detail analysis of the  facts, but there are some that we just have to go through.  You heard a lot of new facts yesterday in our presentation. On  Saturday, what we were pointing to was a very quick overview, and then  yesterday we spent the day--and we appreciate everybody's patience on  that--going through the facts: They showed you this, but they didn't  show you that.  The facts are important, though, because facts have legal  ramifications; legal ramifications impact the decisions you make. So I  don't take facts lightly, and I certainly don't take the constitutional  mandate lightly, and we can't.  The facts we demonstrated yesterday and briefly on Saturday  demonstrate that there was, in fact, a proper governmental interest in  the questions that the President asked and the issues that the  President raised on that phone call.  A phone call--now, let's--again, put your feet in the shoes of the  President. Put yourself in the President's position. Do you think he  thought, when he was on the call, it was him and President Zelensky he  was talking to, and that was it? Or as I heard one commentator say it  was--people listening in on the call--the President and 3,000 of his  closest friends.  Let's be realistic. The President of the United States knew, when he  was on that call, there were a lot of people listening from our side  and from their side. So he knew what he was saying. He said it. We  released a transcript of it.  The facts on the call that have been kind of the focus of all of this  really focused on foreign policy initiatives both in Ukraine and around  the globe. They talked about other countries. The President has been  very concerned about other countries carrying some of the financial  load here, not just the United States. That is a legitimate position  for a President to take. If you disagree with it, you have the right to  do that, but he is the President. As my colleague Deputy White House  Counsel Philbin just said, that is the executive branch prerogative.  That is their constitutional, appropriate role.  So the call is well documented. There were lots of people on the  call. The person that would be on the other end of the quid pro quo, if  it existed, would have been President Zelensky. But President  Zelensky--and we already laid out the other officials from Ukraine--has  repeatedly said there was no pressure. It was a good call. They didn't  even know there was a pause in [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S624\">Page S624</a>, ] the aid. All of that is well documented. I am not going to go through  each and every one of those facts. We did that over the last several  days.  President Zelensky's senior adviser, Andriy Yermak, was asked if he  ever felt there was a connection between military aid and the request  for investigations, and he was adamant that ``We never had that  feeling'' and ``We did not have the feeling that this aid was connected  to any one specific issue.'' This is coming from the people who were  receiving the aid.  So we talk about this whole quid pro quo, and that was a big issue.  That is how this--actually, before it became an impeachment proceeding,  there was--as the proceedings were beginning in the House Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence under Chairman Schiff's role, there  were all these discussions: Is it a quid pro quo? Was it extortion? Was  it bribery? What was it?  And we are clear in our position that there was no quid pro quo. But  then yesterday, my cocounsel, Professor Alan Dershowitz, explained last  night that these articles must be rejected--he was talking about from a  constitutional framework--even if it was a quid pro quo, which we have  clearly established there was not.  And this is what he said, and I am going to quote it verbatim:  The claim that foreign policy decisions can be deemed   abuses of power based on subjective opinions about mixed or   sole motives that the President was interested only in   helping himself demonstrate the dangers of employing the   vague, subjective, and politically malleable phrase ``abuse   of power'' as a constitutionally permissible criteria for the   removal of a President.  He went on to say:  Now, it follows from this that if a President--any   President--were to have done what ``The Times'' reported   about the content of John Bolton's manuscript, that would not   constitute an impeachable offense.  I am quoting exactly from Professor Dershowitz. He said:  Let me repeat it. Nothing in the Bolton revelations, even   if true--  Even if true.  would rise to the level of abuse of power or an impeachable   offense. That is clear from history. That is clear from the   language of the Constitution. You cannot turn conduct that is   not impeachable into impeachable conduct simply by using   words like ``quid pro quo'' and ``personal benefit.''  It is inconceivable that the Framers would have intended so   politically loaded and promiscuously deployed a term as   ``abuse of power'' to be weaponized--  Again, Professor Dershowitz.  as a tool of impeachment. It is precisely the kind of vague,   open-ended, and subjective term Framers feared and rejected.  Now, to be specific: You cannot impeach a President on an unsourced  allegation. But what Professor Dershowitz was saying is that even if  everything in there is true, it constitutionally doesn't rise to that  level.  But I want to be clear on this because there is a lot of speculation  out there with regard to what John Bolton has said, which referenced a  number of individuals. We will start with the President. Here is what  the President said in response to that New York Times piece:  I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied   to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. In   fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very   public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to   sell a book.  The Department of Justice.  While the Department of Justice has not reviewed Mr.   Bolton's manuscript, the New York Times' account of his   conversation grossly mischaracterizes what Attorney General   Barr and Bolton discussed.  There was no discussion of ``personal favors'' or ``undue   influence'' on investigations, nor did Attorney General Barr   state that the President's conversations with foreign leaders   were improper.  The Vice President's chief of staff issued a statement:  In every conversation with the President and the Vice   President, in preparation for our trip to Poland--  Remember, that was the trip that was being planned for the meeting  with President Zelensky.  the President consistently expressed his frustration that the   United States was bearing the lion's share of responsibility   for aid to Ukraine and that European nations weren't doing   their part.  The President also expressed concerns about corruption in   Ukraine, and at no time did I hear him tie Ukraine aid to   investigations into the Biden family or Burisma.  That was the response responding to an unpublished manuscript that  maybe some reporters have an idea of maybe what it says. I mean, that  is what the evidence--if you want to call that evidence. I don't know  what you call that. I would call it inadmissible, but that is what it  is.  To argue that the President is not acting in our national interest  and is violating his oath of office, which the managers have put  forward, is wrong based on the facts and the way the Constitution is  designed.  When you look at the fullness of the record of their witnesses--their  witnesses--the witnesses' statements, the transcripts--there is one  thing that emerged: There is no violation of law. There is no violation  of the Constitution. There is a disagreement on policy decisions.  Most of those who spoke at your hearings did not like the President's  policy. That is why we have elections. That is where policy  differentials and differences are discussed. But to have a removal of a  duly elected President based on policy differences is not what the  Framers intended.  If you lower the bar that way, danger, danger, danger, because the  next President or the one after that--he or she would be held to that  same standard. I hope not. I pray that is not what happens, not just  for the sake of my client but for the Constitution. Professor  Dershowitz gave a list of Presidents, from Washington to where we are  today, who, under the standard that they are proposing, could be  subject to abuse of power or obstruction of Congress.  We know that this is not about a President pausing aid to Ukraine. It  is really not about the law. It is about a lot of attempts on policy  disagreements that are not being debated here. My goodness, how much  time--how much time has been spent in the House of Representatives  hoping? They were hoping that the Mueller probe would result in--I  mean, I am not going to play all the--I was thinking about it, playing  all the clips from all the commentators the day after Bob Mueller  testified. Bob Mueller was unable to answer, under his examination,  basic and fundamental questions. He had to correct himself, actually.  He had to correct himself before the Senate for something that he said  before the House. So that is what the President has been living with.  And we are today arguing about what? A phone call to Ukraine or  Ukraine aid being held or a question about corruption or a question  about corruption that happened to involve a high-profile public figure?  Is that what this is? Is that where we are?  Then what do we find out? The aid was released. It was released in an  orderly fashion. The reform President, President Zelensky, wins, but  there was a question on whether his party would take the Parliament. It  did. They worked late into the evening with the desire to put forward  reforms. So everybody was waiting, including--and you heard the  testimony from, I will say, their witnesses--you heard the testimony-- everybody was concerned about Ukraine. Everybody was concerned about  whether these reforms could actually take place. Everybody was  concerned about it. So you hold back.  It didn't affect anything that was going on in the field. We heard  Mr. Crow worrying about the soldiers. I understand that, I appreciate  that, but none of that aid was affecting what was going on in the  battlefield right then or for the next 4 months because it was future  aid. Are we having an impeachment proceeding because aid came out 3  weeks before the end of the fiscal year, for a 6-minute phone call? You  boil it down, that is what this is.  It is interesting to me that everybody said: Well, the aid was  finally released September 11 only because of the committee and the  whistleblower we have never seen. Mr. Philbin dealt with that in great  detail. I am not going to go over that again. But, you know, the new  high court, the anti-corruption court, wasn't established and did not  sit until September 5, 2019. So while the President of Ukraine was  trying to get reforms put in place, the court that was going to decide  corruption issues was not set until September 5.  I want you to think about this for a moment too. They needed a high  court of corruption for corruption. Think [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S625\">Page S625</a>, ] about that for a moment. Now, it is good that they recognized it, but  remember when I said the other day that you don't wave a magic wand and  now Ukraine doesn't have a corruption problem? The high court of  corruption, which they have to have because it is not just past  corruption--they are concerned about ongoing corruption issues.  You could put all of your witnesses back under oath in the next  hearings you will have when this is all over, and you are going to be  back in the House and you are going to be doing this again, putting  them all back under oath, and ask them, Mr. Schiff, is there a problem  with corruption in Ukraine? If they get up there and say: No.  Everything is great now, hallelujah--but I suspect they are going to  say: We are working really hard on it. But this idea that it has just  vanished and now we are back into ``everything is fine'' is absurd.  Mr. Morrison testified that while the developments were taking place,  the Vice President also met with President Zelensky in Warsaw. That was  the meeting of September 1--the one, by the way, where the Vice  President's Office said in response to this New York Times article that  nobody told him about aid being held or linked to investigations.  Are you going to stop--are you going to allow proceedings on  impeachment to go from a New York Times report about someone that says  what they hear is in a manuscript? Is that where we are? I don't think  so. I hope not.  What did Morrison say? You heard firsthand that the new Ukraine  administration was taking concrete steps to address corruption. That is  good. He advised the President that the relationship with Zelensky is  one that could be trusted. Good.  President Zelensky also agreed with Vice President Pence--this is  interesting--that the Europeans should be doing more and related to  Vice President Pence conversations he had been having with European  leaders about getting them to do more.  In sum, the President raised two issues he was concerned with to get  them addressed.  Now I have already gone over--again, this is just the closing moments  here of our portion of this proceeding. Aid was withheld or paused, put  on a pause button not just for Ukraine but for Afghanistan, South  Korea, El Salvador, Guatemala, Lebanon, and Pakistan. I am sure I am  leaving countries out. But do you think the American people are  concerned if the President says: You know, before we give a country, I  don't know, $550 million--some countries, only $400 million--we would  like to know what they are doing with it. You are supposed to be the  guardians of the trust here. It is the taxpayers' money we are  spending.  There was a lot of testimony from Dr. Fiona Hill, John Bolton's  deputy. Here is what she said about aid that was being held. This was  her testimony: There was a freeze put on all kinds of aid and  assistance because it was in the process at the time of an awful lot of  reviews of foreign assistance.  Oh, you mean there was a policy within the administration to review  foreign assistance and how we are doing it because we spend a lot of  money?  By the way, I am not complaining about the money. I don't think  anybody doesn't want to help. But we do need to know what is going on,  and those are valid and important questions.  Manager Crow told you that the President's Ukraine policy was not  strong against Russia, but Ambassador Yovanovitch stated the exact  opposite. She said in her deposition that our country's Ukraine policy  under President Trump actually--her words--``got stronger'' than it was  under President Obama.  So, again, policy disagreements. Disagreements on approach. Have  elections. That is what we do in our Republic.  For 3 long days, House managers presented their case by selectively  showing parts of testimony. Good lawyers show parts of testimony. You  don't have to show the whole thing. But other good lawyers show the  rest of the testimony. And that is what we sought to do to give you a  fuller view of what we saw as the glaring omissions by my colleagues,  the House managers.  The legal issues here are the constitutional ones, and I have been I  think pretty clear over the last week, starting when we had the motions  arguments, in my concern about the constitutional obligations that we  are operating under. I have been critical of Manager Nadler's  ``executive privilege and other nonsense.''  I want you to look at it this way. Take out executive privilege;  First Amendment free speech and other nonsense; the free exercise of  religion and other nonsense; the right to due process and other  nonsense; the right of equal protection under the law and other  nonsense. You can't start doing that. You would not do that. No  administration has done that, in fact, since the first administration,  George Washington. They wanted information. He thought it was  privileged. He said it was executive privilege.  Let's not start calling constitutional rights ``other nonsense'' and  lumping them together. This is from the House of Representatives that  actually believes the attorney/client privilege doesn't apply, which  should scare every lawyer in Washington, DC, but more scary for their  clients. They say that in writing, in letters. They don't hide it.  I would ask them--I am not going to; it is not my privilege to do  that--do you really believe that? Do you really believe that the  attorney/client privilege does not apply in a congressional hearing? Do  you really believe that? Because if that is what is believed or  implied, then there is no attorney/client privilege--or is that the  attorney/client privilege and other nonsense? Danger, danger, danger.  We believe that article I fails constitutionally. The President has  constitutional authority to engage in and conduct foreign policy and  foreign affairs. It is our position legally--the President at all times  acted with perfect legal authority, inquired of matters in our national  interest, and, having received assurances of those matters, continued  his policy that his administration put forward of what really is  unprecedented support for Ukraine, including the delivery of a military  aid package that was denied to the Ukrainians by the prior  administration.  Some of the managers right here, my colleagues at the other table,  voted in favor of those--wanted Javelin anti-tank missiles for Ukraine.  Some of the Members here did not, didn't want to do that, voted against  that. I am glad we gave it to them. I am glad we allowed them to  purchase Javelins.  I never served in the military. I have tremendous, tremendous respect  for the men and women who protect our freedom. I have tremendous  respect for what they are doing and continue to do.  This President actually allowed the Javelins to go. Some of you liked  that idea; some of you did not. Policy difference. Were you going to  impeach President Obama because he did not give them lethal aid? No.  Nor should you. You should not do that. It is a policy difference.  Policy differences do not rise to the level of constitutionally  mandated or constitutional applications for removal from office. It is  policy differences.  By the way, it is not just on lethal weapons; President Obama, as I  said, withheld aid. He had the right to do that. You have allowed him  to do that.  Oh, but we don't like that this President did it, so the rules  change. So this President's rules are different than--he has a  different set of standards he has to apply than what you allowed the  previous administrations to apply. And you know what--or the future  administrations to apply. That is the problem with these articles.  We have laid out, I believe, a compelling case on what the  Constitution requires. When they were in the House of Representatives  putting this together, did they go through a constitutionally mandated  accommodation process to see if there was a way to come up with  something? No, they did not. Did they run to court? No. And the one  time it was about to happen, they ran the other way.  Separation of powers means something. It is not separation of powers  and other nonsense. If we have reached now, at this very moment in the  history of our Republic, a bar of impeachment because you don't like  the President's policies or you don't like the [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S626\">Page S626</a>, ] way he undertook those policies--because we heard a lot about policy.  If partisan impeachment is now the rule of the day, which these Members  and Members of this Senate said should never be the rule of the day--my  goodness, they said it--some of them--5 months ago, but then we had the  national emergency, a phone call. It is an emergency, except we will  just wait.  But if partisan impeachment based on policy disagreements, which is  what this is, and personal presumptions or newspaper reports and  allegations in an unsourced--maybe this is in somebody's book who is no  longer at the White House--if that becomes the new norm, future  Presidents, Democrats and Republicans, will be paralyzed the moment  they are elected, before they can even take the oath of office. The bar  for impeachment cannot be set this low.  Majority Leader McConnell, Democratic Leader Schumer, House managers,  Members of the Senate--danger, danger, danger. These articles must be  rejected. The Constitution requires it. Justice demands it.  We would ask the majority leader for a short recess, if we can, about  15 minutes.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.  Recess    ", "Mr. TRUMP": " Mr. TRUMP. Russia, if you are listening, I hope you're able   to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will   probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's see if that   happens.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Following Special Counsel Mueller's testimony,  during which he warned against future interference in our elections,  did the President recognize the threat posed to our democracy and  renounce Russian interference in our democracy? Did he choose to stand  with his own intelligence agencies, both Houses of Congress, and the  special counsel's investigation in affirming that Russia interfered in  our last election?  He did not.  Instead, only one day after Special Counsel Mueller testified before  Congress, empowered in the belief that he had evaded accountability for  making use of foreign support in our last election, President Trump was  on the phone with the President of Ukraine, pressing him to intervene  on President Trump's behalf in the next election.  Let's take a moment to let that sink in.  On July 24, Bob Mueller concludes a lengthy investigation. He comes  before the Congress. He testifies that Russia systemically interfered  in our election to help elect Donald Trump, that the campaign  understood that, and that they willfully made use of that help. On July  24, that is what happens.  On the very next day--the very next day--President Trump is on the  phone with a different foreign power, this time Ukraine, trying to get  Ukraine to interfere in the next election--the next day.  That should tell us something. He did not feel chained by what the  special counsel found. He did not feel deterred by what the special  counsel found. He felt emboldened by escaping accountability, for the  very, very next day, he is on the phone, soliciting foreign  interference again.  Now, that July 25 phone call between President Trump and President  Zelensky was a key part of President Trump's direct and corrupt  solicitation of foreign help in the 2020 election.  The question likely sounded familiar to President Zelensky, who had  been swept into office in a landslide victory on a campaign of rooting  out just the type of corruption he was being asked to undertake on this  call with our President.  Zelensky campaigned as a reformer, as someone outside of politics who  would come up and clean up corruption, who would end the political  prosecutions, end the political investigations. And what is his most  important and powerful patron asking him to do? To do exactly what he  campaigned against. No wonder he resisted this pressure campaign.  Now, President Trump had been provided talking points for discussion  by the National Security Council staff beforehand, including  recommendations to encourage President Zelensky to continue to promote  anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine. So the National Security staff  understood what was in the U.S. national security interests, and that  was rooting out corruption, and they encouraged the President to talk  about it.  But as you see from the record of the call--and I join the President  in saying ``read the call''--that topic was never [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S449\">Page S449</a>, ] addressed. The word ``corruption'' never escapes his lips.  Instead, President Trump openly pressed President Zelensky to pursue  the two investigations that would benefit him personally.  In response to President Zelensky's gratitude for the significant  military support the United States had provided to Ukraine, President  Trump said:  I would like you to do us a favor though because our   country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about   it. I would like you to find out what happened with this   whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike . . . I   guess you have one of your wealthy people . . . The server,   they say Ukraine has it.  That is that crazy conspiracy theory I talked about earlier that  there is this server somewhere in Ukraine that shows that, in fact, it  was Ukraine that hacked the DNC, not the Russians. That is a Russian  propaganda conspiracy theory, and here it is being promulgated by the  President of the United States. And more than promulgated, he is  pressuring an ally to further this Russian propaganda because he was  referring to this extensively discredited conspiracy theory that  Ukraine was the one that really hacked the DNC--the Democratic National  Committee--servers in 2016.  And that reference to CrowdStrike--well, that is an American cyber  security firm. And the theory--this kooky conspiracy theory--is that  CrowdStrike moved the DNC servers to Ukraine to prevent U.S. law  enforcement from getting it.  If Ukraine announced an investigation into this fabrication,  President Trump could remove what he perceived to be a cloud over his  legitimacy--legitimacy of his last election, Russia's assistance with  his campaign--and suggest that it was the Democratic Party that was the  real beneficiary of that.  On the call, President Trump told Zelensky: ``Whatever you can do,  it's very important that you do it if that's possible.''  President Zelensky agreed that he would do the investigation saying:  ``Yes it is very important for me and everything that you just  mentioned earlier.''  President Trump then turned to his second request, asking President  Zelensky to look into the sham allegation into former Vice President  Biden. President Trump said to President Zelensky:  The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son,   that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want   to find out about that so whatever you can do with the   Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging   that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it .   . . It sounds horrible to me.  There is no question what President Trump intended in pressing the  Ukrainian leader to ``look into'' his political rival. Even after the  impeachment inquiry began, he confirmed his desire on the south lawn of  the White House, declaring not only that Ukraine should investigate  Biden but that China should do the same.  Let's see what he said.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  NEWS REPORTER. What exactly did you hope Zelensky would do   about the Bidens after your phone call? Exactly.  PRESIDENT TRUMP. Well, I would think that, if they were   honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the   Bidens. It's a very simple answer.  They should investigate the Bidens, because how does a   company that is newly formed--and all these companies, if you   look at--  And, by the way, likewise, China should start an   investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China   is just about as bad as what happened with--with Ukraine.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The day after that July 25 phone call, President  Trump sought confirmation that President Zelensky understood his  request to announce the politically motivated investigations and that  he would follow through.  After meeting with Ukranian officials, including President Zelensky  and his top aide, the President's handpicked Ambassador to the European  Union, Gordon Sondland, called President Trump from an outdoor  restaurant in Kyiv to report back. This was the second conversation  between the two about Ukraine in as many days.  David Holmes, an American diplomat dining with Sondland, overheard  the call, including the President's voice through the cell phone. I  described part of that call last night.  Holmes testified that President Trump asked Sondland: ``So he's going  to do the investigation?'' Sondland replied that he is going to do it,  adding that President Zelensky will do ``anything you ask him to do.''  After the phone call, Holmes ``took the opportunity to ask Ambassador  Sondland for his candid impression of the President's views on  Ukraine.'' According to Holmes:  (Text of Videotape presentation:)    ", "Mr. KARL": " Mr. KARL. Let's be clear. What you just described is a quid   pro quo. It is funding will not flow unless the investigation   into the Democratic server happened as well.    ", "Ms. YOVANOVITCH": " Ms. YOVANOVITCH. She said that there was great concern on   the seventh floor of the State Department. That's where the   leadership at the State Department sits. There was great   concern. They were worried. She just wanted to give me a   heads up about this. And, you know, things seemed to be going   on, and so she just wanted to give me a heads up.  Mr. Manager NADLER. Confused, the Ambassador asked for more  information from Washington. Three hours later they spoke again.  Ambassador Yovanovitch learned that there were concerns about her ``up  the street''; that is, at the White House. The Ambassador was told to  get on the first plane home.  Why was this respected career diplomat abruptly removed from her  post? Why was she, in fact, urged by the State Department to catch the  first plane home, that she was in danger, she shouldn't wait?  At the time, the White House would not say, but today we know the  truth. The truth is that Ambassador Yovanovitch was the victim of a  smear campaign organized by Rudy Giuliani, amplified by President  Trump's allies, and designed to give President Trump the pretext he  needed to recall her without warning. Mr. Giuliani has admitted as much  to the press.  In order to understand Mr. Giuliani's smear campaign against  Ambassador Yovanovitch, you need to know about a few additional  characters who Mr. Giuliani drew into his scheme.  The first of these characters is Viktor Shokin, the disgraced former  prosecutor general of Ukraine, who was fired by the Ukrainian  Government for gross corruption. In 2016, at the urging of the European  Union, the International Monetary Fund, and the U.S. Government, the  Parliament of Ukraine voted to remove Mr. Shokin as prosecutor general  because he was corrupt and refused to prosecute corruption cases. The  United States, the European Union, and the International Monetary Fund  all urged the Ukraine Government to dismiss Mr. Shokin.  The second character is Yuriy Lutsenko, who succeeded Mr. Shokin as  prosecutor general. Mr. Lutsenko also proved reluctant to prosecute  corruption cases, and several witnesses testified that he also had a  reputation for dishonesty and corruption. Ambassador Yovanovitch and  Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent both testified that the U.S.  Embassy in Kyiv eventually stopped working with Mr. Lutsenko  altogether.  Shokin, Lutsenko, and Giuliani--the goals of all three characters  were aligned. Shokin had it out for Vice President Biden because of the  role that the Vice President played in his 2016 firing. The Vice  President, carrying out U.S. policy, urged the Ukrainian Government to  dismiss the corrupt Shokin.  I note that the Vice President--the former Vice President--has been  criticized for urging that he be fired.  Lutsenko found his career trajectory fading and wanted President  Trump's support to boost his political prospects in Ukraine. Giuliani  needed partners in Ukraine willing to announce two sham investigations  meant to boost President Trump's own campaign. All three wanted  Ambassador Yovanovitch out of the way.  So in early 2019, the smear campaign began. Mr. Lutsenko became the  primary vector for false allegations against Ambassador Yovanovitch.  Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent testified that Lutsenko's  allegations against Ambassador Yovanovitch were motivated by revenge.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)    ", "Mr. MALONEY": " Mr. MALONEY. Thank you, sir. I yield back. [applause].  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Imagine. He had to tell his father: Do  not worry; I will be fine for telling the truth. It was his duty  because, in America, right matters.  President Trump has suggested that all of the witnesses are Never  Trumpers. That couldn't be further from the truth. As we just saw,  these U.S. officials are brave public servants. It is wrong--just flat  wrong--to suggest they were doing anything other than testifying out of  a sense of duty, as Lieutenant Colonel Vindman testified.  But it wasn't just U.S. officials whose reactions show us that this  was wrong; it is also clear how corrupt this scheme was because Ukraine  resisted it. President Zelensky was elected as a reformer. His first  few months in office lived up to this promise.  Here is Ambassador Taylor testifying on this point. Let's see it.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador TAYLOR. But once I arrived in Kyiv, I discovered   a weird combination of encouraging, confusing, and ultimately   alarming circumstances.  First, the encouraging. President Zelensky was reforming   Ukraine in a hurry. He appointed reformist ministers and   supported long-stalled anti-corruption legislation. He took   quick executive action, including opening Ukraine's High   Anti-Corruption Court. With a new parliamentary majority   stemming from snap elections, President Zelensky changed the   Ukraine Constitution to remove absolute immunity from Rada   deputies, the source of raw corruption for two decades. The   excitement in Kyiv was palpable. This time could be   different, a new Ukraine finally breaking from its corrupt,   post-Soviet past.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. So we know that President Zelensky was a  reformer, fighting corruption, fighting for reform, and he got started  early, as soon as he was sworn in. We know that President Zelensky's  agenda was in our U.S. national interest. In fact, every witness  testified that President Zelensky deserved America's support and that  they told President Trump that.  So keeping that in mind, it is extremely telling what President  Zelensky and his aides were saying behind closed doors. They were  concerned about being dragged into President Trump's scheme. They  recognized the political peril of going along with the President's  corrupt scheme. We know that was the case for many reasons, but let's  look at some of the evidence showing that now.  First, the Ukrainians made their concerns clear directly to U.S.  officials. On July 20, just days ahead of the July 25 call, Ambassador  Taylor spoke with President Zelensky's national security advisor. He  then conveyed to Ambassadors Sondland and Volker that the Ukrainian  leader ``did not want to be used as a pawn in a U.S. reelection  campaign.''  Here is Ambassador Taylor explaining what he understood that to mean.  Let's watch.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)    ", "Mr. VINDMAN": " Mr. VINDMAN. To the best of my recollection, Ambassador   Sondland said that in order to get a White House meeting, the   Ukrainians would have to provide a deliverable, which is   investigations, specific investigations.  Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Ambassador Volker separately confirmed this  recollection during his testimony.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador VOLKER. I participated in the July 10 meeting   between National Security Advisor Bolton and then-Ukrainian   Chairman of the National Security and Defense Council, Alex   Danyliuk. As I remember, the meeting was essentially over   when Ambassador Sondland made a general comment about   investigations. I think all of us thought it was   inappropriate.  Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Ambassador Bolton also found Ambassador  Sondland's reference to be inappropriate, and he abruptly ended the  meeting. However, Ambassador Sondland was not deterred. He convened a  second meeting where he discussed what needed to happen before an Oval  Office meeting. Apparently, Ambassador Sondland had received his  marching orders from the President, and he was determined to carry them  out.  Bolton sent Dr. Hill to join that meeting and report back. This is  what Dr. Hill had to say:  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Dr. HILL. And so when I came in, Gordon Sondland was   basically saying, well, look, we have a deal here that there   will be a meeting--I have a deal here with Chief of Staff   Mulvaney. There will be a meeting if the Ukrainians open up   or announce these investigations into 2016 and Burisma. And I   cut it off immediately there. Because by this point,   having heard Mr. Giuliani over and over again on the   television and all of the issues that he was asserting, by   this point it was clear that Burisma was code for the   Bidens because Giuliani was laying it out there.  Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. After the meeting, Dr. Hill followed up with  Ambassador Bolton and relayed what transpired. Bolton was alarmed. In  other words, Ambassador Bolton didn't want any part of it. He directed  Dr. Hill to brief the NSC's top attorney, John Eisenberg, as she  explained during her hearing.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  GOLDMAN. What was that specific instruction?  Dr. HILL. The specific instruction was that I have to go to   the lawyers, to John Eisenberg, our senior counsel for the   National Security Council, to basically say, you tell   Eisenberg, Ambassador Bolton told me, that I am not part of   this whatever drug deal that Mulvaney and Sondland are   cooking up.  GOLDMAN. What did you understand him to mean by the drug   deal that Mulvaney and Sondland were cooking up?  Dr. HILL. I took it to mean investigations for a meeting. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S467\">Page S467</a>, ]  GOLDMAN. Did you go speak to the lawyers?  Dr. HILL. I certainly did.  Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. As a former chief of police, I think it is  quite interesting that Ambassador Bolton categorized the corrupt  scheme--the pressure campaign--as a ``drug deal.'' I think Ambassador  Bolton was trying to send us a very powerful message that not only  would the lawyers, the top lawyer understand, but that every person  would understand--every Member of the House, every Member of the  Senate, every member of our great country, every citizen.  And Ambassador Bolton also wanted to make clear, especially to the  top attorney, that he did not want to have anything to do with the drug  deal in progress. But we do know now, of course, that Ambassador Bolton  can testify directly about this. He can testify directly for himself  about this meeting if he appears before this body, as he has indicated  that he is prepared to do if this body is willing to issue a subpoena.  We need to hear from Ambassador Bolton, and I know the American people  want to hear from Ambassador Bolton as well.  Dr. Hill testified that she spoke to Mr. Eisenberg twice. Dr. Hill  also indicated that Mr. Eisenberg took notes of their meeting, which  we, to no surprise now, do not have. We have not received them because  of the President's obstruction.  It is clear that Ambassador Sondland was not operating a rogue  operation. He testified that everyone was in the loop. Let's listen  once again.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador SONDLAND. Everyone was in the loop. It was no   secret. Everyone was informed via email on July 19th, days   before the Presidential call. As I communicated to the team,   I told President Zelensky in advance that assurances to run a   fully transparent investigation and turn over every stone   were necessary in his call with President Trump.  Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. In the email reference, Ambassador Sondland  wrote the following to Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Perry, and Mr.  Mulvaney regarding President Zelensky.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  He is prepared to receive POTUS' call. Will assure him that   he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will   ``turn over every stone.''  Both Mulvaney and Perry responded to the email noting that the head- of-state call would be scheduled right away. Now, you may be asking:  What did Mulvaney know about these investigations, and did he have any  conversations with President Trump about them?  Senators, this body is entitled to see all of the evidence, and do  you know what? The American people are entitled to hear all of the  evidence. And while the nature of the ``drug deal'' we have talked  about was uncontested, it is important for the country to know that  everyone was involved because we have heard that everyone was in the  loop.  Now, later this day, July 19, Ambassador Sondland texted Ambassadors  Volker and Taylor about the upcoming head-of-state telephone call, and  the text said:  Looks like Potus call tomorrow. I [spoke] directly to   Zelensky and gave him a full briefing. He's got it.  Ambassador Volker replied to Sondland's text: ``Most [important] is  for Zelensky to say that he will help investigations.''  The evidence shows that the Ukrainians understood what they needed to  do to earn a White House meeting with the President.  On July 20, the day after Ambassador Sondland's phone call with  President Zelensky, Ambassador Taylor spoke with the Ukrainian national  security advisor. Ukraine's national security advisor conveyed that the  Ukrainian President did not want to become an instrument in U.S.  politics.  Here is how Ambassador Taylor explained that concern:  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  GOLDMAN. What did you understand it to mean when--that   Zelensky had concerns about being an instrument in Washington   domestic reelection politics?  Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Danyliuk understood that these   investigations were pursuant to Mr. Giuliani's request to   develop information, to find information about Burisma and   the Bidens. This was very well known in public. Mr. Giuliani   made his point clear in several instances in the beginning--  in the springtime.  And Mr. Danyliuk was aware that that was a problem.  GOLDMAN. And would you agree that, because President   Zelensky is worried about this, they understood, at least,   that there was some pressure for them to pursue these   investigations? Is that fair?  Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Danyliuk indicated that President   Zelensky certainly understood it, that he did not want to get   involved in these types of activities.  Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. The next day, Ambassador Taylor relayed the  Ukrainian leader's concerns to Volker and Sondland, but Ambassador  Sondland did not back down.  Specifically, Ambassador Sondland texted in response to Ambassador  Taylor's worry: ``Absolutely, but we need to get the conversation  started and the relationship built, irrespective of the pretext.''  Again, Ambassador Sondland had his marching orders, and he was  determined to carry them out.  A call between President Trump and President Zelensky was scheduled  for July 25.  Before the call, President Trump spoke to Sondland and reiterated his  expectation that the Ukrainian leader would commit to the  investigations.  Ambassador Sondland subsequently contacted Ambassador Volker and  relayed the message to him.  Volker then texted Zelensky's top aide with President Trump's  instruction: ``[A]ssuming President Z convinces trump he will  investigate / `get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will  nail down the date for a visit to Washington.''  Senators, in other words, even before the July 25 phone call with  President Zelensky, before it ever took place, Ukraine understood that  it needed to initiate the investigation into the debunked conspiracy  theory about the 2016 election as a condition for President Zelensky,  the newly elected Ukrainian President, to visit the White House.  Ambassador Sondland testified that acting on President Trump's direct  orders, he and Ambassador Volker prepped President Zelensky for the  telephone call.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  GOLDMAN. And you would agree that the message in this--that   is expressed here is that President Zelensky needs to   convince Trump that he will do the investigations in order to   nail down the date for a visit to Washington, D.C. Is that   correct?  Ambassador SONDLAND. That's correct.  Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. By this time, nonpartisan career officials  involved with Ukraine policy had become aware of this quid pro quo.  Here is what three of them said during their testimony:  Ambassador Taylor: ``. . . the meeting President Zelensky wanted was  conditioned on investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian  influence in the 2016 elections . . .''  Ambassador David Holmes: ``. . . it was made clear that some action  on a Burisma/Biden investigation was a precondition for an Oval Office  visit.''  Dr. Hill: ``There seems to be an awful lot of people involved in, you  know, basically turning a White House meeting into some kind of asset''  that was ``dangled out to the Ukrainian Government.''  A White House visit--a visit to the Oval Office--was dangled out to  the Ukrainian Government.  Senators, I ask you to think about those words as we decide--as you  decide--what action you will take. Think about those words. There was  no doubt the direction came from the President of the United States.  The President was at the center of this scheme.  Ambassador Sondland testified: ``Mr. Giuliani was expressing the  desires of the President of the United States, and we knew these  investigations were important to the President.''  Ambassador Sondland added that Mr. Giuliani ``followed the direction  of the President'' and ``we followed the President's orders.''  However, as Ambassador Taylor testified, ``Ambassador Bolton was not  interested in having--did not want to have the call because he thought  it was going to be a disaster.'' He thought that there could be some  talk of investigations or even worse than that, he thought.  I ask you today, Senators: What was Ambassador Bolton so afraid that  President Trump would say to the newly elected Ukrainian President? [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S468\">Page S468</a>, ] What was the National Security Advisor so afraid that President Trump  would say to President Zelensky?  This is another topic we would like to ask Ambassador Bolton about if  and when he appears before this body.  Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished Members of the  Senate, I thank you, once again, for your indulgence and for your  courtesy as we all undertake our solemn constitutional responsibilities  during this Senate trial.  George Washington once observed in his Farewell Address to the Nation  that the Constitution was sacredly obligatory upon all. That means  everyone. In fact, that is what makes our great country so distinct  from authoritarian regimes and enemies of democracy. Vladimir Putin is  above the law in Russia; Erdogan is above the law in Turkey; Kim Jong  Un is above the law in North Korea, but in the United States of  America, no one is above the law, not even the President of the United  States. That is what this moment is all about.  As we all know, Congress is a separate and coequal branch of  government. We don't work for this President or any President. We, of  course, work for the American people. We have a constitutional  responsibility to serve as a check and balance on an out-of-control  executive branch. That is not from the Democratic Party's playbook, and  that is not from the Republican Party's playbook. That is from the  playbook of a democratic republic.  James Madison once observed in Federalist No. 51 that the Congress  should serve as a rival to the executive branch.  In my humble opinion, why would Madison use the word ``rival''?  It is that the Framers of the Constitution, I think, did not want a  King; they did not want a dictator; they did not want a Monarch. They  wanted a democracy. The Constitution is sacredly obligatory upon all.  It is through that lens that we proceed today.  For the next few moments, I would like to discuss President Trump's  July 25 phone call with Ukraine's newly elected leader.  The President claims that his call was perfect. Nothing can be  further from the truth. The call is direct evidence of President  Trump's solicitation of foreign interference in the 2020 election as  part of a corrupt scheme. It is important, of course, to remember the  context of this call.  New Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was in a vulnerable  position and viewed American and diplomatic military support as  critical to his standing and to Ukraine's fragile future as a  democracy. Equally significant, as outlined by my colleagues, America  has a strong national security interest in supporting Ukraine against  Russia's continued aggression.  William Taylor, a West Point graduate, a Vietnam war hero, and  Ambassador to Ukraine, appointed by Donald Trump, testified: ``Ukraine  is a strategic partner of the United States--important for the security  of our country as well as Europe.''  LTC Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council officer, a Trump  appointee, a Purple Heart recipient, an Iraq war veteran, testified:  ``A strong and independent Ukraine is critical to our national security  interests.''  Ukraine remains under attack by Russian-backed separatists in Crimea.  It is an ongoing hot war. Ukraine is a friend. Russia is a foe. Ukraine  is a democracy. Russia is a dictatorship. The United States may very  well be one of the other things standing between Russia and Ukraine's  being completely overrun. As part of that, Vladimir Putin continues  aggression against the free world. That is why this Congress allocated  $391 million in military and security aid to a vulnerable Ukraine on a  bipartisan basis. It is that it is in America's national security  interests.  On the July 25 call, Mr. Trump could have endeavored to strengthen  the relationship with this new Ukrainian leader. Instead, President  Trump focused on securing a personal favor. He wanted Ukraine to  conduct phony investigations, designed to enhance his political  standing and solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election.  On the July 25 call, President Trump maligned a highly respected  American Ambassador, known as an anti-corruption crusader. At the same  time, he praised a corrupt former Ukrainian prosecutor, and on multiple  occasions, President Trump directed Ukraine's new leader to speak with  his personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, on an official call.  Mr. Giuliani is not a member of the Trump administration. For these  and other reasons, the July 25 call warrants our close scrutiny. It  presents significant and shocking evidence of President Trump's corrupt  intent. The call lays bare the President's willingness to do whatever  it takes to get what he wants even if his behavior undermines the  national security interests of the United States of America.  At the beginning of the call, President Zelensky mentioned U.S.  military aid, and he states: ``I would also like to thank you for your  great support in the area of defense.'' The great support in the area  of defense includes the security assistance passed by this Congress, on  a bipartisan basis, that Donald Trump held up in violation of the law.  Immediately after President Zelensky raised the issue of defense  support, President Trump responded: ``I would like you to do us a  favor, though.''  These words will live in infamy.  First, President Trump said to President Zelensky, as part of the two  demands that he requested:  I would like you to find out what happened with this whole   situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike . . . I guess   you have one of your wealthy people. . . . The server, they   say, Ukraine has it.''  President Trump continued:  I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your   people, and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As   you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor   performance by a man named Robert Mueller--  A Vietnam war hero, by the way--  a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an   incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started   with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it's very important that   you do it if that's possible.  Who is the ``they'' referred to by President Trump putting forth the  baseless conspiracy theory that the Ukrainians, not the Russians, were  behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee server in 2016?  ``They'' means Russia. ``They'' means Putin. ``They'' are enemies of  the United States.  Not a single witness who testified before the House knew of any  factual basis for President Trump's belief in the CrowdStrike Ukraine  fairytale. To the contrary, the U.S. intelligence community and this  Senate Intelligence Committee assessed that Russia interfered in the  2016 election.  As Dr. Fiona Hill testified, the theory that Ukraine interfered in  the 2016 election ``is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated  and propagated by the Russian security services.''  The conspiracy theory that President Trump advanced on the July 25  phone call is stone-cold Russian propaganda.  As early as February 2017, Vladimir Putin began to promote this lie  during a press conference saying:  The Ukrainian Government adopted a unilateral position in   favor of one candidate. More than that, certain oligarchs,   certainly with the approval of the political leadership,   funded this candidate, or female candidate, to be more   precise.  Those are the words of Vladimir Putin--a script apparently adopted by  President Donald John Trump.  If there was any doubt about who benefits from this unfounded,  Russian-inspired conspiracy theory advanced by Donald Trump, Vladimir  Putin made it clear when he said in November of 2019:  Thank God no one is accusing us anymore of interfering in   U.S. elections. Now they're accusing Ukrainians.  Unfortunately, this is not the first time President Trump tried to  capitalize on Russian propaganda and misinformation for his own  political benefit.  On July 24, just one day before this call, Special Counsel Robert  Mueller testified before Congress that the ``Russian government  interfered in the 2016 election in sweeping and systematic fashion'' in  order to support the Trump campaign and divide America.  Mr. Mueller also found that the Trump campaign welcomed Russian  interference in the 2016 election and utilized it as part of its  campaign messaging.  Despite the clear and overwhelming conclusion of U.S. intelligence  agencies, as well as the distinguished Senate Intelligence Committee,  that Russia, not Ukraine interfered in the 2016 [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S469\">Page S469</a>, ] election, President Trump continued to press the new Ukrainian leader  to announce an investigation into the CrowdStrike Ukraine conspiracy  theory.  Why? President Trump sought a political favor--that is why--as part  of a scheme to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election.  The second demand made by President Trump on the July 25 call related  to the campaign of Vice President Joe Biden, who announced his  intention to run for the Office of the Presidency last April.  Throughout the spring and early summer of last year, public polling  consistently showed that Biden would decisively defeat President Trump.  In fact, on June 16 of last year--June 16--a FOX News poll showed that  President Trump would lose to Joe Biden by 10 points.  The concern with Joe Biden's candidacy provides motive for President  Trump's demand that the Ukrainian Government investigate the former  Vice President and his son Hunter.  Here is what President Trump said on that call:  The other thing, there's a lot of talk about Biden's son,   that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want   to find out about that so whatever you can do with the   Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging   that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it .   . . It sounds horrible to me.  Now, the Trump administration officials who participated in the  impeachment inquiry unanimously testified that there was no factual  support for the allegation that Vice President Biden did anything wrong  or misused his authority when he pressed for the removal of Ukraine's  corrupt former prosecutor general. Joe Biden did nothing wrong. The  witnesses testified that Vice President Biden was in fact carrying out  official U.S. policy to clean up the prosecutor general's office in  Ukraine.  This policy, of course, aligned with the perspective of many in this  very distinguished body, as well as our European allies throughout the  world, as well as the International Monetary Fund.  Vice President Biden did not remove Yuriy Lutsenko, the corrupt  prosecutor. The Ukrainian Government did with the support of the free  world.  Nonetheless, on October 3, 2019, when a reporter asked President  Trump, ``What exactly did you hope Zelensky would do about the Bidens  after your phone call,'' President Trump responded as follows.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  News Reporter. What exactly did you hope Zelensky would do   about the Bidens after your phone? Exactly?  President TRUMP. Well, I would think that, if they were   honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the   Bidens. It's a very simple answer.  Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Start a major investigation into the Bidens.  The evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump is hiding in plain sight.  During the July 25 call, President Trump also repeatedly pressed the  Ukrainian President to coordinate with his personal attorney, Rudolph  Giuliani.  Why was Rudolph Giuliani's name mentioned multiple times during the  July 25 phone call? Giuliani is not the Secretary of State. He is not  an ambassador. He is not a member of the diplomatic corps.  Rudolph Giuliani is a cold-blooded political operative for President  Trump's reelection campaign. That is why he was referenced multiple  times on that July 25 phone call, and it is evidence of corrupt intent  by President Trump.  By the time the call took place, President Zelensky understood  Giuliani's connection to the shakedown scheme. He recognized Giuliani's  role as the President's political operative on matters related to  Ukraine.  Zelensky informed President Trump that one of his aides spoke with  Mr. Giuliani ``just recently'' and ``we are hoping very much that Mr.  Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he  comes.''  The Ukrainian leader knew Giuliani represented President Trump's  political interests in his country and could help unlock the long- sought-after Oval Office meeting that President Zelensky desired.  The phony investigations sought by President Trump on the July 25  call were not designed to bolster the national security interests of  the United States of America--quite the contrary. President Trump  sought to benefit himself and his own reelection prospects.  On the July 25 call, President Trump also suggested that President  Zelensky speak with the Attorney General William Barr about the two  fake investigations that the President sought.  This is important to keep in mind. At no time during this entire  sordid scheme was there an ongoing American law enforcement  investigation into the phony slander related to Joe Biden or the  conspiracy theory related to Ukrainian interference in the 2016  election. At no time was there an ongoing American law enforcement  investigation.  America is the leader of the free world. We do not urge other  sovereign countries to target American citizens absent any legitimate  basis whatsoever, absent any scintilla of evidence.  Apparently, President Trump does not play by those rules. During the  July 25 call, President Trump didn't raise legitimate corruption  concerns as it relates to the Ukraine. President Trump did not mention  the word ``corruption'' once. The President did, however, viciously  malign former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, a  distinguished anticorruption advocate whom he abruptly removed because  she was seen as an obstacle to his geopolitical shakedown.  Ambassador Yovanovitch joined the diplomatic corps under President  Ronald Reagan and subsequently served three other Republican  Presidents. She is a highly respected diplomat and Foreign Service  professional. Yet President Trump told the new Ukrainian leader the  former Ambassador from the United States, ``the woman,'' was bad news,  and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news. ``So  I just want to let you know that.''  He didn't stop there. Later in the call, President Trump ominously  added, ``Well, she's going to go through some things.'' These are the  words of the President of the United States of America.  Ambassador Yovanovitch did not know of President Trump's disparaging  remarks at the time. She didn't learn them until the call record became  public in September. Asked whether she felt ``threatened'' by President  Trump's statement that ``she's going to go through some things,''  Ambassador Yovanovitch answered that she did. Here is what she said.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)    ", "Mr. GERHARDT": " Mr. GERHARDT. No. It plainly does not. Everything we know   about the history of impeachment reinforces the conclusion   that impeachable offenses do not have to be crimes. And,   again, not all crimes are impeachable offenses. We look,   again, at the context of the gravity of the misconduct.  Mr. Manager NADLER. This position was echoed by the Republicans'  expert witness, Professor Turley, in his written testimony.  There, he stated: ``It is possible to establish a case for  impeachment based on a non-criminal allegation of abuse of power.''  He also stated: ``It is clear that high Crimes and Misdemeanors can  encompass non-criminal conduct.''  More recently, Professor Turley--again, the Republican witness at our  hearing--wrote an opinion piece in the Washington Post entitled ``Where  the Trump defense goes too far.'' In this piece, he stated that the  President's argument ``is as politically unwise as it is  constitutionally shortsighted.'' He added: ``If successful, it would  also come at a considerable cost for the Constitution.'' Although I  disagree with Professor Turley on many, many issues, here, he is  clearly right.  I might say the same thing of then-House Manager Lindsey Graham, who,  in President Clinton's trial, flatly rejected the notion that  impeachable offenses are limited to violations of established law.  This is what he said:  (Text of Videotape presentation:)    ", "Mr. EISEN": " Mr. EISEN. Professor Gerhardt, do you agree that abuse of   power is impeachable?    ", "Ms. KARLAN": " Ms. KARLAN. Yes, they do.    ", "Mr. DERSHOWITZ": " Mr. DERSHOWITZ. If a President does something which he   believes will help him get elected--in the public interest--  that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in   impeachment. The fact that he has announced his candidacy is   a very good reason for upping the interest in this son. If he   wasn't running for President, he's a has-been. He is the   former Vice President of the United States. OK, big deal. But   if he is running for President, that is an enormous big deal.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So it is certainly true that when public  officials take actions, they may have in mind, when they make a policy  judgment, what is the impact on my political career going to be, or,  what is the impact going to be on my reelection prospects, but that is  a very different question than whether they can engage in a corrupt act  to help their election--in this case, to get foreign help to cheat in  an election.  I think we can distinguish between the fact that political actors  have political interests and what the President's defense would argue,  and that is, if he believes it is in his reelection interest, then no  quid pro quo is too corrupt. If we go down that road, there is no limit  to what this or any other President can do. There is no limit to what  foreign powers will feel they can offer a corrupt President to help  their reelection if that is the precedent we intend to establish.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel. Thank you, Mr. Manager.  The Senator from New Jersey.    ", "Mr. FELDMAN": " Mr. FELDMAN. The Framers reserved impeachment for   situations where the President abused his office, that is,   used it for his personal advantage. And, in particular, they   were specifically worried about a situation where the   President used his office to facilitate corruptly his own   reelection. That's, in fact, why they thought they needed   impeachment and why waiting for the next election wasn't good   enough.  Professor Feldman's testimony is grounded in the records of the  Constitutional Convention.  There, William Davie warned that a President who abused his office  might spare no efforts or means whatever to get himself reelected and,  thus, to escape justice.  George Mason built on Davie's position, asking: ``Shall the man who  has practiced corruption, and by that means procured his appointment to  the first instance, be suffered to escape punishment by repeating his  guilt?'' Mason's concern was straightforward. He feared that Presidents  would win election by improperly influencing members of the electoral  college.  Gouverneur Morris later echoed this point, urging that the Executive  ought therefore to be impeachable for corrupting his electors.  Taken together, these debates demonstrate an essential point: The  Framers knew that a President who abused power to manipulate elections  presented the greatest possible threat to the Constitution. After all,  the beating heart of the Framers' project was a commitment to popular  sovereignty.  At a time when democratic self-government existed almost nowhere on  Earth, the Framers imagined a society where power flowed from and  returned to the people. That is why the President and Members of  Congress must stand before the public for reelection on fixed terms,  and if the President abuses his power to corrupt those elections, he  threatens the entire system.  As Professor Karlan explained in her testimony:  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Professor KARLAN. [D]rawing a foreign government into our   elections is an especially serious abuse of power because it   undermines democracy itself. Our Constitution begins with the   words ``We the people'' for a reason. Our government, in   James Madison's [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S492\">Page S492</a>, ]  words, derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the   great body of the people, and the way it derives these powers   is through elections. Elections matter, both to the   legitimacy of our government and to all of our individual   freedoms, because, as the Supreme Court declared more than a   century ago, voting is preservative of all rights.  Mr. Manager NADLER. Professor Karlan is right--elections matter. They  make our government legitimate, and they protect our freedom. A  President who abuses his power in order to kneecap political opponents  and spread Russian conspiracy theories--a President who uses his office  to ask for or, even worse, to compel foreign nations to meddle in our  elections--is a President who attacks the very foundations of our  liberty. That is a grave abuse of power. It is an unprecedented  betrayal of the national interest. It is a shocking corruption of the  election process, and it is without a doubt a crime against the  Constitution, warranting, demanding his removal from office.  The Framers expected that free elections would be the usual means of  protecting our freedoms, but they knew that a President who sought  foreign assistance in his campaign must be removed from office before  he could steal the next election.  In a last-ditch legal defense of their client, the President's  lawyers argue that impeachment and removal are subject to statutory  crimes or to offenses against established law, that the President  cannot be impeached because he has not committed a crime. This view is  completely wrong. It has no support in constitutional text and  structure, original meaning, congressional precedents, common sense, or  the consensus of credible experts. In other words, it conflicts with  every relevant consideration.  Professor Gerhardt succinctly captured the consensus view in his  testimony.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  COUNSEL. Now, Professor Gerhardt, does a high crime and   misdemeanor require an actual statutory crime?    ", "Mr. GRAHAM": " Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, it  is my honor to speak on the floor about this nomination, which I think  is historic in many facets and all positive from my point of view.  We have before the committee the nomination of Judge Barrett, who  currently sits on the Seventh Judicial Circuit. She is one of the most  impressive people I have ever met. Two days of hearings; answering  every question thrown to her with grace and judicial demeanor. I think  it should be the gold standard for every other nominee.  I want to thank my staff, beginning with Lee Holmes, the director.  Lee has done such a great job on the Judiciary Committee and has done a  lot of things--some contentious and some not. I want to thank Lee for  shepherding this nomination and the fine work he has done.  Mike Fragoso--Mike, I got your first name right anyway. He is just  outstanding. He has done a terrific job.  The permanent nominations unit for the Judiciary Committee includes  Lauren Mehler, Raija Churchill, Tim Rodriguez, Watson Horner, and Akhil  R-A-J-A-S-E-K-A-R--I don't want to butcher your name. They all worked  incredibly hard for 135 article III judges, not just this one.  In addition, Lucas Croslow joined my staff to lead the team of  special counsels assisting with the Barrett nomination. That included  Sidd Dadhich, D-A-D-H-I-C-H, Joe Falvey, Abby Hollenstein, Eric Palmer,  and Robert Smith. They went through the entire record presented by  Judge Barrett to make sure we would be prepared for the confirmation  process.  The law clerks were Matt Simpson, Emily Hall, Megan Cairn, and Peter  Singhal. I would like to thank the Judiciary Committee's press  secretary, Taylor Reidy. They did a great job, along with George  Hartmann, as well as our deputy staff director, Joe Keeley.  The bottom line is, all of them worked really hard. They made  history. They should be proud and tell [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6583\">Page S6583</a>, ] their grandkids about all this. Well done.  To my Democratic colleagues, I know you didn't like what we did, but  I do appreciate the way you conducted yourselves in the hearing. It  wasn't a circus. I think you challenged the judge appropriately during  your time. We had 4 days of hearings. We heard from a variety of people  about Judge Barrett.  In terms of the process, it was well within what we have done in the  past. In every Judiciary Committee markup regarding a Supreme Court  Justice, we have done the same thing. The first day is opening  statements, then 2 days of questions, and the final day is input from  outside groups. That is what we were able to do here. So she went  through the process like every other nominee since I have been here.  But let me just say this to my Democratic colleagues. It is not about  the process. You will find ways to make sure that most of you can't  vote for anybody we nominate. It really does break my heart.  With Roberts, 78 to 22, that was sort of the norm. I think Alito got  96 and Ginsburg got 97. Maybe I got the numbers right. I can't remember  who got what, but one got 96 and one got 97. It used to not be this  way. It used to be different.  We looked at the qualifications and said: OK, you are good to go. You  are a person of integrity. You are smart. You are well rounded. You are  knowledgeable in the law. You may have a different philosophy than I  have, but we understand elections matter. And everybody accepted the  election outcome. Those days are over, absolutely completely over and  destroyed. There is nobody any Republican President can ever nominate,  I think, who is not going to face a hard time. That is too bad. That is  the way it is.  Alito, 58 to 42--Judge Alito was well known on our side of the aisle.  He was the kind of person you would be looking at to promote to the  Supreme Court. President Bush nominated him. Well within the  mainstream. Roberts and Alito were well known in the conservative  world, being ver bright court of appeals judges whom any Republican  President would be looking at to put on the Court if they ever had an  opportunity. There is no difference between Alito and Roberts, but  Alito went through hell. But he made it, and he got 58 votes.  So then along comes President Obama. He gets two picks--Sotomayor, 68  votes to 31. I think she deserved more, but 68 is pretty darn good. I  was glad to vote for her. I saw that she was qualified. Then we had  Elena Kagan, 63 votes. You can see the trend here. Both of them were  Obama nominees, 68 and 63, and I thought Elena Kagan was highly  qualified. She had a different judicial philosophy. She was a dean of  the law school at Harvard but worked for the Solicitor General's  Office. Both of them had been with the liberal side of the Court most  every case but not all. I am not surprised the way they decided cases.  I think they are tremendously well-qualified women and should be  sitting on the Court. That is exactly who you would expect a Democratic  President to pick--Sotomayor and Kagan.  So now we come back. Trump wins. Nobody thought he would win,  including me. I voted for somebody in 2016 I wouldn't know if he walked  through the door--Evan McMullin. I think I met him once. I had my  challenge for President Trump during the 2016 primary. He beat me like  a drum. I accepted my defeat. I have been trying to help him ever  since, and I think he has done a really good job of sending to the  Senate highly qualified judges. He has gotten input from a lot of  different people--the Federalist Society, you name it--a lot of  different people.  Gorsuch and Kavanaugh had one thing in common: They were in my top  three recommendations. Any Republican President looking to nominate  somebody to the Supreme Court would be looking at Gorsuch and  Kavanaugh. These are not exotic picks. They are in the mold of  Sotomayor and Kagan in terms of qualifications.  So what happened? Gorsuch was the first attempt at a partisan  filibuster. We had three votes to get 60, and we couldn't, so we  changed the rules for the Supreme Court like they changed the rules in  2013 for the district court and court of appeals. If we had not,  Gorsuch wouldn't be on the Court. And to say he is not qualified is a  joke. It is an insult to him and says more about you than it does Judge  Gorsuch. If you can't see he is qualified, you are blinded by your  hatred of Trump. So he made it, but we had to change the rules. We  hated to do it but had to do it because in any other time, Gorsuch  would have gotten the same type votes as Roberts because he is just  highly qualified.  Then comes along Kavanaugh. Nothing about process there. There was no  process argument. Right at the very end, the last day of the hearing  when we thought it was all over, you give us a letter that you had for  weeks, an allegation against the judge. It would have been nice to  share it with him so he could tell his side of the story, but you chose  not to do that. You had it precooked with the press outlets, and  everything blew up.  So all of us on the committee had to decide what to do. I sat down  with Senator Flake and Senator Collins, and we felt like the  allegations had to be heard. They are made. I know a lot of people on  our side thought it was unfair, dirty pool, but we had the opportunity  to have the hearing, and the rest is history. It was high drama.  All I can say is that something happened to the person who accused  Judge Kavanaugh, but I don't believe Judge Kavanaugh had anything to do  with it. This was a party in high school. Ms. Ford couldn't remember  where it was and who was there. The people who were said to have been  there said they don't remember anything like it happened.  Judge Kavanaugh hasn't lived a life like what was being described. He  was accused by four or five people. Three of them actually made it up.  I hope some of them go to jail for lying to the committee and the  country. They were trying to make him a rapist and drugging women in  high school, and what was his annual all about? It was the most  sickening episode in my time in the Senate. They were hell-bent on  destroying this guy's life based on a bunch of manufactured lies and  evidence that wouldn't get you out of the batter's box in any court of  law in the land.  And here we are, 50 to 48. What I saw there was a turning point for  me. We cannot continue to do this. You are going to drive good people  away. And I am hoping that the Barrett hearings, which were far more  civil and far more traditional, will be a turning point because I don't  know who the next President will be, but there will be an opening, I am  sure, on the Court. I am hoping that the next hearing is more like  Barrett's and less like Kavanaugh's, no matter who wins.  Now, Barrett. I understand the concern about the process. This is the  latest we have ever confirmed somebody. You heard all the arguments  about when the President is of one party and the Senate of a different  party; you have had one confirmation in 100-some years; that most of  the time, when the President is of the same party as the Senate, they  go through. I understand.  The bottom line is, we gave her the same type hearing that Alito,  Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh had. My Democratic colleagues  showed up at the hearing, they participated, they pushed her hard, but  I don't think they went across the line. They decided not to show up  for markup. I hate that, but that is the way it is.  I would like to spend a few minutes talking about the person who is  going onto the Court in about an hour.  If you are looking for somebody a Republican would be picking,  regardless of the process, it would be Judge Barrett. She would be on  anybody's list.  I listened to Senator Durbin, who is a good friend, and we will work  on whatever comes our way after the election. I find that he is  somebody you can work on hard things like immigration with. But his  description of Judge Barrett simply doesn't pass scrutiny.  He is trying to make a character of this person that doesn't exist.  There is nothing exotic about Judge Barrett. She is very mainstream in  our world. All I can say is that after 2 days of hearings, the American  people, by 51 percent--it is pretty hard to figure that in this  country, you get 51 percent agreement on anything--felt like she should  be going onto the Court.  Here is what Dean O'Hara said, the dean of Notre Dame Law School, who [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6584\">Page S6584</a>, ] hired Amy Barrett to be a professor at Notre Dame:  I have only communicated with this august committee on two   occasions. The first was ten years ago when I wrote a strong   letter in support of now-Justice Elena Kagan, whose term as   dean of Harvard Law School overlapped with my own. The second   is today introducing and endorsing Amy Coney Barrett in   equally strong terms. Some might find these recommendations   to be in juxtaposition, but I find them entirely consistent.  To anybody wondering about Judge Barrett, I would highly recommend  that you look at the ABA's recommendations and the process they used to  find her ``well qualified.'' Not one person uttered a negative word  about her character, according to the ABA. Someone said to the ABA: The  myth is real. She is a staggering academic mind. She is incredibly  honest and forthright. She is exactly who you think she is. Nothing  about her is fake. She is good, she is decent, she is selfless, and she  is sincere. She is an exemplar of living an integrated life.  The Standing Committee would have been hard-pressed to come up with  any conclusion other than that Judge Barrett has demonstrated  professional competence that is exceptional. Then they had a committee  to look at her writings--all of her writings. They accepted input from  944 people she has interacted with in her professional life. Not one  negative comment.  So forget about what politicians say about Judge Barrett. Forget  about what people who don't recognize President Trump as being a  legitimate President say about Judge Barrett. Forget about what I say  if you want to. Look at what people who worked with her said, who are  in the law business, who know her individually and have worked with her  as a judge, as a professor, and they conclude without any doubt that  she is one of the most gifted people to ever be nominated to the  Supreme Court.  There is nothing exotic about Judge Barrett. She is going onto the  Court in about an hour. That is exactly where she needs to be. She is  the type of person who has lived a life worthy of being nominated. She  is the type of person who is worthy of receiving a large vote in the  Senate, but she won't get it.  She is not going to get one Democratic vote. Write her out of the  process if you want to. That is fine. But what about the others? All I  can say is that we are going to have an election here in about a week,  and whatever happens, I am going to acknowledge the winner when it is  all said and done.  It may go to the Supreme Court. I don't know. But there will be a day  that we know who won, and I am going to accept those results, and I am  going to do with the next President what I have tried to do with this  one and every other one--try to find a way forward on things that are  hard to keep the country moving forward.  To the majority leader and the minority leader, it is a tough place  around here now. This, too, shall pass. But this is about Judge  Barrett. This is about her time, her moment. She has done everything  you would expect of her. She has exceeded every challenge put in her  way. She has impressed everybody she has worked with. She has impressed  the country. She is going onto the Court because that is where she  deserves to be.  As to us in the Senate, maybe down the road we can get back to the  way we used to be. I don't know. But I do know this. There is nothing  exotic about Judge Barrett. She is as mainstream as it gets from our  side of the aisle.  When it comes to people outside of politics looking at her, it was  universal: ``highly qualified,'' ``highly competent,'' ``ready to serve  this country as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.''  My last thought: It is hard to be a conservative person of color.  That is a very difficult road to hoe in modern American politics. My  good friend Tim Scott is a great voice for conservatism. And Tim--a lot  of things were said about Tim that were said about nobody else on our  side of the aisle. He is tough. He can handle it. The same for  conservative women.  Judge Barrett did not abandon her faith. She embraces it. But she  said: I embrace my faith. But as a judge, it will not be the rule of  Amy. It will be the rule of law. It will be the facts. It will be the  law and the outcome dictated by the law, not by anything I personally  believe.  I will say this. For the young, conservative women out there who are  pro-life and embrace your faith, there is a seat at the table for you.  This is historic. This nomination is different. This is a breakthrough  for conservative young women.  I was honored to be the chair of the committee that reported out  Judge Barrett to the floor of the Senate, and I am going to be honored  to cast my vote to put her on the Supreme Court, exactly where she  deserves to be.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. HIMES": " Mr. HIMES. Exactly.    ", "Mr. BOSSERT": " Mr. BOSSERT. It's not only a conspiracy theory, it is   completely debunked. You know, I don't know want to be glib   about this matter, but last year, retired former Senator Judd   Gregg wrote a piece in The Hill magazine saying the three   ways or the five ways to impeach oneself. And the third way   was to hire Rudy Giuliani.  And at this point, I am deeply frustrated with what he and   the legal team is doing in repeating that debunked theory to   the president. It sticks in his mind when he hears it over   and over again. And for clarity here, George, let me just   again repeat that it has no validity. The United States   government reached its conclusion on attributing to Russia   the DNC hack in 2016 before it even communicated it to the   FBI and long before the FBI ever knocked on the door at the   DNC. So a server inside the DNC was not relevant to our   determination to the attribution. It was made upfront and   beforehand. And so while servers can be important in some of   the investigations that followed, it has nothing to do with   the U.S. government's attribution of Russia to the DNC hack.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. The theory ``has no validity.'' That is  what he said.  Dr. Hill, too, testified that White House officials, including Mr.  Bossert and former National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster spent a lot  of time refuting the CrowdStrike conspiracy theory to President Trump.  Let's hear it.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Daniel GOLDMAN. Now, Dr. Hill, is this a reference to this   debunked conspiracy theory about Ukraine interference in the   2016 election that you discussed in your opening statement as   well as with Chairman Schiff?  Fiona HILL. The reference to CrowdStrike and the server,   yes, that's correct.  Daniel GOLDMAN. And it is your understanding that there is   no basis for these allegations, is that correct?  Fiona HILL. That's correct.  Daniel GOLDMAN. Now, isn't it also true that some of   President Trump's most senior advisors had informed him that   this theory of Ukraine interference in the 2016 election was   false?  Fiona HILL. That's correct.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. When she was asked if it is false, she  said: ``That's correct.''  If Vladimir Putin's goals, as Dr. Hill testified, were to deflect  from Russia's systematic interference in our election and to drive a  wedge between the United States and Ukraine, he has succeeded beyond  his wildest dreams. The alternative narrative of Ukrainian interference  in the 2016 election has now been picked up by the President's  defenders and the conservative media. It has muddied the waters  regarding Russia's own interference in our elections--efforts that  remain ongoing, as we have learned this week from reporting that Russia  hacked Burisma. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S498\">Page S498</a>, ]  If there were any doubt about how President Putin feels about the  President's conduct, you need only look to Putin's own words. His  statement on November 20 tells it all. He said:  Thank God nobody is accusing us anymore of interfering in   U.S. elections. Now they're accusing Ukraine.  That is a short quotation from Putin, but it speaks volumes. Even  though President Trump knew there was no factual basis for the theory  that it was Ukraine that interfered in the 2016 election rather than  Russia and knew that Russia was perpetuating this theory, he still  wanted President Zelensky to pursue the investigation. Why? Because,  while Putin and Russia clearly stood to gain by promoting this  conspiracy theory about Ukraine, so did Donald Trump. He knew it would  be politically helpful to his 2020 election.  An announcement of an investigation by Ukraine would have breathed  new life into a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukrainian election  interference was there in 2016, and it lent it great credibility. It  would have cast doubt on the conclusions of the Intelligence Committee  and Special Counsel Mueller that Russia interfered in the 2016 election  to help President Trump. And it would have helped eliminate a perceived  threat to the legitimacy of Donald Trump's Presidency, that he was only  elected because of the help he received from President Putin.  I now yield to Mr. Schiff.    ", "Mr. GIULIANI": " Mr. GIULIANI. I am not going to go because I think I'm   walking into a group of people that are enemies of the   President.  Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. It appears Giuliani's statement influenced  President Trump's view of Ukraine, as well. At an Oval Office meeting  on May 23, U.S. officials learned of Giuliani's influence. Ambassador  Volker testified that President Trump ``didn't believe'' the positive  assessment government officials gave the new Ukrainian President.  Instead, President Trump told them that Giuliani ``knows all of these  things'' and said that President Zelensky has ``some bad people around  him.'' At this point, the scheme had stalled. Mr. Giuliani and the  President knew that they were going to have [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S510\">Page S510</a>, ] trouble with President Zelensky fulfilling his corrupt demand for  investigations that would benefit President Trump's reelection  campaign.  That brings us to the next phase of this scheme. Although his corrupt  scheme was in trouble due to the unexpected results of the Ukrainian  election--the election which yielded an anti-corruption reformer-- President Trump doubled down on his scheme to solicit investigations  for his personal benefit.  In May of 2019, with a gap in American leadership in Ukraine after  Ambassador Yovanovitch was removed, President Trump enlisted U.S.  officials to help to do his political work. The scheme grew from false  allegations by disgruntled, corrupt Ukrainian prosecutors to a plot by  the President of the United States to extort the new Ukrainian  President into announcing his political investigations. During the May  23 Oval Office meeting, President Trump directed Ambassador Sondland,  Ambassador Volker, and Secretary Perry to work with Mr. Giuliani on  Ukraine. Giuliani had made clear he was pursuing investigations for  President Trump in a personal capacity. He said publicly, on numerous  instances, that he was only working for the President in a personal  capacity and not on foreign policy. Yet President Trump still told  White House officials that they had to work with Mr. Giuliani to get  anywhere on Ukraine. We heard significant testimony on this point. For  example, Ambassador Volker recalled that at the Oval Office meeting on  May 23, President Trump directed the U.S. officials to ``talk to  Rudy.'' Ambassador Sondland testified that President Trump directed  them to ``talk to Rudy.'' In that moment, the U.S. diplomats saw the  writing on the wall and concluded ``that if we did not talk to Rudy,  nothing would move forward, nothing would move forward on Ukraine.''  Pay attention to Ambassador Sondland's testimony.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador SONDLAND. In response to our persistent efforts   in that meeting to change his views, President Trump directed   us to, quote, ``talk with Rudy.'' We understood that ``talk   with Rudy'' meant, talk with Mr. Rudy Giuliani, the   President's personal lawyer.  Let me say again, we weren't happy with the President's   directive to talk with Rudy. We did not want to involve Mr.   Giuliani. I believe then, as I do now, that the men and   women of the State Department, not the President's   personal lawyer, should take responsibility for Ukraine   matters.  Nonetheless, based on the President's direction, we were   faced with a choice. We could abandon the efforts to schedule   the White House phone call and the White House visit between   Presidents Trump and Zelensky, which was unquestionably in   our foreign policy interest, or we could do as President   Trump had directed and talk with Rudy. We chose the latter,   of course, not because we liked it, but because it was the   only constructive path open to us.  Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. And just like that, U.S. officials charged with  advancing U.S. foreign policy--U.S. officials who were supposed to act  in our country's interest--were directed to, instead, advance President  Trump's personal interests. From that point on, they worked with the  President's personal agent on political investigations to benefit the  President's reelection.  Their work on President Trump's behalf to solicit foreign  interference in our elections continued throughout all of June. For  instance, on June 21, Mr. Giuliani tweeted that President Zelensky had  not yet publicly committed on two politically motivated investigations  designed to benefit President Trump. And when Mr. Giuliani's public  efforts and his tweets didn't move President Zelensky to announce the  investigations, he used U.S. diplomats as directed by President Trump.  This is important.  After Giuliani canceled his trip to Ukraine in May and commented that  President-elect Zelensky had enemies of President Trump around him,  Giuliani had minimal access to the new Ukrainian leader's inner circle.  His primary Ukraine connection, Prosecutor General Lutsenko, had  already been informed that he would be removed as soon as the new  Parliament convened. So President Trump gave him U.S. diplomats and  directed them to work with Mr. Giuliani on his scheme. As you heard,  President Trump told Ambassadors Sondland and Volker to talk with Rudy  and work with Rudy on Ukraine. And what did that mean? Well, Mr.  Giuliani tried to use Ambassador Sondland and Volker to gain access to  President Zelensky and his inner circle through their official State  Department channels and made clear to President Zelensky that he had to  announce the investigations.  On June 27, Ambassador Sondland brought Ambassador Taylor up to speed  on Ukraine since Ambassador Taylor had just arrived in the country a  few weeks beforehand. Ambassador Sondland explained that President  Zelensky needed to make clear that he was not standing in the way of  the investigations that President Trump wanted--that President Zelensky  needed to make clear that he was not standing in the way of the  investigations that President Trump wanted. And here is his testimony.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador TAYLOR. On June 27th, Ambassador Sondland told   me during a phone conversation that President Zelensky needed   to make clear to President Trump that he, President Zelensky,   was not standing in the way of investigations.  Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Ambassador Taylor relayed this conversation to  one of his deputies, U.S. Diplomat David Holmes, who testified that he  understood the investigations to mean the ``Burisma-Biden  investigations that Mr. Giuliani and his associates had been speaking  about'' publicly.  Let's listen to Mr. Holmes.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)    ", "Ms. BREAM": " Ms. BREAM. You are not going to go?    ", "Ms. COOPER": " Ms. COOPER. Russia.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Russia was not only emboldened on the  battlefield. Ambassador Taylor testified that President Trump's corrupt  withholding of military assistance and his failure to host President  Zelensky in the Oval Office was a ``sign of weakness'' to Moscow. It  harmed Ukraine's negotiating position, even as recently as December 9  when Zelensky and Putin met to discuss the conflict in the east shown  in this photo.  Ambassador Taylor explained:  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  The CHAIRMAN. I think you also testified that Russia was   watching closely to gauge the level of American support for   the Ukrainian government. Why is that significant?  Ambassador TAYLOR. This is significant, Mr. Chairman,   because the Ukrainians, in particular under this new   administration, are eager to end this war, and they were   eager to end it in a way that the Russians leave their   territory. These negotiations, like all negotiations, are   difficult. Ukrainians would like to be able to negotiate from   a position of strength or at least more strength than they   now have. Part of that strength, part of the ability of the   Ukrainians to negotiate against the Russians with the   Russians for an end to the war in Donbas, depends on United   States and other international support. If we withdraw or   suspend or threaten to withdraw our security assistance,   that's a message to the Ukrainians, but it's at least as   important, as your question indicates, Mr. Chairman, to the   Russians, who are looking for any sign of [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S540\">Page S540</a>, ]  weakness or any sign that we are withdrawing our support for   Ukraine.  The CHAIRMAN. And so, when the Ukrainians learned of the   suspension of the military aid, either privately or when   others learned publicly, the Russians would be learning also,   and they would take that as a lack of robust U.S. support for   Ukraine. Is that right?  Ambassador TAYLOR. That's correct, sir.  The CHAIRMAN. And that would weaken Ukraine in negotiating   an end to the war in Donbas.  Ambassador TAYLOR. It would.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Indeed, the aid doesn't just supply much needed  weapons to Ukraine. It is a symbol of support, a signal of strength, a  signal of the backing of the United States. Withholding that aid, even  for a period of time, undermined all of those things.  President Trump's actions toward Ukraine also undercut worldwide  confidence in the United States as a reliable security partner.  Maintaining that confidence is crucial to the strength of our alliances  in Europe to deterring Russia and ultimately protecting and projecting  democracy around the world.  The United States has roughly 68,000 troops stationed in Europe. They  serve alongside troops from 28 other countries that comprise the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO. They are holding the line  against further Russian aggression. It was U.S. leadership that led to  the creation of NATO 70 years ago as the Iron Curtain was descending  across the heart of Europe, and it is American leadership that makes  NATO work today.  NATO is also affected because other countries, friends and foes  alike, know that we are committed to our collective defense; that an  attack against one nation is an attack against all of us. That  principle deterred a Russian invasion of Europe during the Cold War. It  has only been invoked once by NATO in the aftermath of the September 11  terrorist attacks. New York is a long way from the frontlines with  Russia, but our European allies stood with us after that dark day.  They deployed tens of thousands of troops to Afghanistan and joined  us in fighting the al-Qaida terrorists who attacked the Twin Towers and  the Pentagon.  Now, Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but Russia's invasion of  Ukraine was a threat to the peace and security of Europe. Moscow's  aggression threatened the rules of the road that have kept the peace in  Europe since World War II, the sacrosanct idea that borders cannot be  changed by military force.  If we had not supported Ukraine in 2014, if Members of this body had  not voted overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis for military assistance  to rebuild Ukraine's military, there is no question it would have  invited further Russian adventurism in Ukraine and perhaps elsewhere in  the heart of Europe. It would have weakened our allies and exposed U.S.  troops stationed in Europe to greater danger.  Deterring Russia requires persistence--not just one military aid  package or one Oval Office meeting but a sustained policy of support  for our partners. We only deter Russia by consistently demonstrating  support for our friends--friends like Ukraine.  George Shultz, who served as Ronald Reagan's Secretary of State,  understood this. He compared diplomacy and alliance management to  gardening. He said:  If you plant a garden and go away for six months, what have   you got when you come back? Weeds. Diplomacy is kind of like   that. You go around, talk to people, you develop a   relationship of trust and confidence, and then if something   comes up, you have that base to work from.  President Trump's decision to transform the military aid and Oval  Office meeting into leverage was the equivalent of trampling all over  George Shultz's garden, crushing Ukraine's confidence in the United  States as a partner. He also caused our NATO allies to question whether  we would stand with them against Russia. Leaders in European capitals  now wonder whether personal political favors and not treaty obligations  guide our foreign policy.  Colleagues, this is how alliances wither and die and how Russia wins.  Ambassador Taylor made clear that is why it is so important to our  security that we stand with Ukraine.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Chairman, as my colleague, Deputy   Assistant Secretary George Kent, described, we have a   national security policy, a national defense policy that   identifies Russia and China as adversaries. The Russians are   violating all of the rules, treaties, understandings that   they committed to that actually kept the peace in Europe for   nearly 70 years. Until they invaded Ukraine in 2014, they had   abided by sovereignty of nations, of inviolability of   borders. That rule of law, that order that kept the peace in   Europe and allowed for prosperity as well as peace in Europe   was violated by the Russians. And if we don't push back on   that, on those violations, then that will continue. And that,   Mr. Chairman, affects us. It affects the world that we live   in, that our children will grow up in, and our grandchildren.   This affects the kind of world that we want to see abroad. So   that affects our national interest very directly. Ukraine is   on the front line of that conflict.  We understood that in 2017, the first year of the Trump  administration, and it appeared the Trump administration understood it  as well. We understood it in 2018, and the Trump administration  understood that as well. We understood that in 2019, and the Trump  administration appeared to as well--at least it did until it didn't. It  did until something of greater importance and significance came along.  That event of greater significance to the Oval Office was the emergence  of Joe Biden as a candidate for President, and then that military  support, which had increased during the Trump administration, was  suddenly put on hold for inexplicable reasons.  Ukraine got the message. It wasn't very inexplicable to Ukraine. What  is more, Russia got the message. It wasn't very inexplicable to Russia,  which had pushed out the whole propaganda theory that it was Ukraine  that had interfered in our election and not Russia.  So that consensus among the Congress and the administration, among  the right and the left and the center, that, as Ambassador Taylor  explained, this is not only vital to Ukraine's security and the post- World War II order that has kept the peace in Europe for 70 years, but  it is vital to us and our security as well, that all broke down. That  all broke down over an effort led by the President and his agent Rudy  Giuliani and his agents Parnas and Fruman to overturn all of that-- overturn a decades-long commitment to standing up to Russian  aggression.  We have so tremendously benefited. No country has benefited more from  the international rules of the road, the international order, than the  United States. It gave us the peace and stability to prosper like no  other nation has before, and we are throwing it away. We are throwing  it away. We are undermining the rule of law. We are undermining the  principle that you don't invade your neighbor. We are undermining the  key to our own success. And for what? For help with a political  campaign. To quote Bill Taylor, that is crazy. That is crazy.  If our allies can't trust us to stand behind them in a time of need,  we will soon not have a single ally left. I know it is painful to see  some of our allies and how they talk about this President because when  they talk about this President, they are also talking about the United  States. It is painful to see our allies distance themselves from the  United States. It is more than painful; it is dangerous. It is  dangerous to us. I think it was Churchill who once said there is  nothing worse than allies except having no allies.  If we are going to condition our support for our allies on their  willingness to be dragged kicking and screaming into our politics, if  we are going to condition the strength of our alliance on whether they  will help us cheat in an election, we are not going to have a single  ally left, and not a single one of us in this Chamber is ever going to  be able to say to one of our counterparts to respect the rule of law  without it being thrown in our face.  Promoting the rule of law and fighting corruption is central to our  foreign policy. It distinguishes U.S. global leadership from the  transactional approach favored by authoritarian adversaries.  The inherently corrupt nature of the President's demand that Ukraine  investigate his political opponent undermined the credibility of  efforts to promote the rule of law and combat corruption in Ukraine and  around the world. Indeed, the President engaging in the very conduct at  home that our policy fights abroad sabotages longstanding bipartisan  pillars of American diplomacy. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S541\">Page S541</a>, ]  This was a problem, not least because the pervasive corruption within  Ukraine leaves its politics and economy susceptible to Russian  influence and subterfuge.  Ambassador Yovanovitch emphasized that U.S. policy in Ukraine has  long recognized that the struggle against corruption and defending  against Russia are, in fact, two sides of the very same coin.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. Corruption makes Ukraine's leaders   ever vulnerable to Russia, and Ukraine people understand   that. That's why they launched the Revolution of Dignity in   2014, demanding to be a part of Europe, demanding   transformation of the system, demanding to live under the   rule of law.  Ukrainians wanted the law to apply equally to all people,   whether the individual in question is the President or any   other citizen. It was a question of fairness, of dignity.  Here, again, there is a coincidence of interests. Corrupt   leaders are inherently less trustworthy while an honest and   accountable Ukrainian leadership makes a U.S.-Ukrainian   partnership more reliable and more valuable to the United   States.  A level playing field in this strategically located   country, bordering four NATO allies, creates an environment   in which U.S. business can more easily trade, invest, and   profit.  Corruption is also a security issue, because corrupt   officials are vulnerable to Moscow.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. During that conversation that we related in the  past, when Ambassador Volker urged his Ukrainian counterpart, Andriy  Yermak, not to investigate the past President of Ukraine and Yermak  threw it back in his face--you remember the conversation: Oh, you mean  like the investigation you want us to do of the Clintons and the  Bidens. They taught us something in that conversation. They taught us  that we had forgotten, for that moment, our own values.  Just listening to the Ambassador right now, I was thinking how  interesting it is that Ukrainians chose to describe their revolution as  a Revolution of Dignity. Maybe that is what we need here--a revolution  of dignity at home, a revolution of civility here at home. Maybe we can  learn a lot more from our Ukrainian ally.  In short, it is in America's national security interest to help  Ukraine transform into a country where the rule of law governs and  corruption is held in check.  As we heard yesterday, anti-corruption policy was a central part of  the talking points provided to President Trump before his phone calls  with President Zelensky on April 21 and July 25. President Trump, of  course, didn't mention corruption, but, importantly, those same foreign  policy goals remained intact following the call, as Tim Morrison  testified. Anti-corruption reforms--institutional reforms--remain a top  priority to help Ukraine fight corruption.  President Zelensky was swept into office on an anti-corruption  platform. Immediately, he kept his promise and introduced numerous  bills in Ukraine's Parliament. In a sign that he intended to hold  himself accountable, Zelensky even introduced a draft law on  Presidential impeachment. He also introduced a bill to restore  punishment of top officials found guilty of ``illicit enrichment.''  President Trump's self-serving scheme threatened to undermine  Zelensky's anti-corruption work. Zelensky's successful anti-corruption  reforms would have advanced U.S. security. Instead, President Trump's  demands undermined that effort to bring about reform to Ukraine.  Here is George Kent, a rule of law and corruption expert at the State  Department.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)    ", "Ms. CARSON": " Ms. CARSON. In 2014, were there concerns in Washington,   here in Washington, and European capitals that Russia might   not stop in Ukraine?    ", "Mr. CARSON": " Mr. CARSON. And which country stands to benefit the most--  would stand to benefit the most from such a withdrawal?    ", "Mr. QUIGLEY": " Mr. QUIGLEY. But has any of the documents that you turned   over, to your knowledge, been turned over to the committee?  Ambassador TAYLOR. No.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Senators, I will confirm. The committees  have not seen not one of these documents--none.  Finally, if it could be any worse--well, it is--a Trump  administration official, Ambassador Sondland, informed us that he was  not even permitted to review his own relevant records in preparation  for their testimony. Again, this would be his own records so that he  could prepare to testify.  Let's watch.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ambassador SONDLAND. I have not had access to all of my   phone records, State Department emails, and many, many other   State Department documents. And I was told I could not work   with my EU staff to pull together the relevant files and   information. Having access to the State Department materials   would have been very helpful to me in trying to reconstruct   with whom I spoke and met and when and what was said.  My lawyers and I have made multiple requests to the State   Department and the White House for these materials. Yet these   materials were not provided to me, and they have also refused   to share these materials with this committee. These documents   are not classified and, in fairness--and, in fairness--should   have been made available.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Of course, we agree.  At President Trump's order, agencies and offices refused to produce  documents in response to the committee's requests, and they refused to  allow individual witnesses to do so either.  So let's recap. No documents--zero, goose egg, nada--in response to  over 70 requests--70 requests and 5 subpoenas. There was no attempt to  negotiate, no genuine attempt to accommodate. There was categorical,  indiscriminate, and unprecedented stonewalling.  Again, never in my time as a lawyer or as a judge have I seen this  kind of total disrespect in defiance of a lawfully issued subpoena--and  all on President Trump's orders. And it could continue because this  obstruction of Congress is real, and it is beyond--beyond--comparison.  This President should be removed.  Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, let's turn to  President Trump's efforts to stop witnesses from testifying.  No other President facing impeachment has taken the extreme step to  prohibit executive branch witnesses from testifying before Congress.  Even President Nixon, who famously attempted to defy a subpoena for  tape recordings of his conversations, let his most senior staff testify  before Congress.  I remember listening on TV as John Dean testified before the Senate  Watergate Committee. He was the President's lawyer. President Nixon  didn't block him. Not only did President Nixon allow his staff to  testify before Congress; he publicly directed them to testify and  without demanding a subpoena.  Actually, with the Senate Watergate investigation, President Nixon  said:  All members of the White House staff will appear   voluntarily when requested by the committee. They will   testify under oath, and they will answer fully all proper   questions.  Now compare that to President Trump. He publicly attacked the House's  impeachment inquiry, calling it ``constitutionally invalid,'' and he  ordered every single person working in the executive branch to defy the  House impeachment inquiry.  As just discussed, in the letter to the Speaker of the House, the  White House Counsel said that President Trump ``cannot permit his  administration to participate.''  No President ever used the official power of his office to prevent  witnesses from giving testimony to Congress in such a blanket and  indiscriminate manner. There is no telling how many government  officials would have come forward if the President hadn't issued this  order.  Let's look at some of the witnesses who followed the President's  orders.  The House issued subpoenas to compel the testimony of three officials  at the Office of Management and Budget: Acting Director Russell Vought,  Associate Director Michael Duffey, and Associate Director, Brian  McCormack.  According to testimony in the House, which was reinforced by emails  recently revealed through the Freedom of Information Act lawsuits, OMB  was just central to the President's hold on security assistance to  Ukraine. Its officials served as conduits for the White House to  implement the hold without directly engaging the agencies that actually  supported release of the aid. President Trump directed these three OMB  officials to violate their legal obligation by defying lawful  subpoenas, and they followed his orders.  This isn't just an argument. It is a fact. In response to House  subpoenas, OMB sent a letter to Chairman Schiff refusing to comply.  This is what the letter said: ``As directed by the White House  Counsel's October 8, 2019, letter, OMB will not participate in this  partisan and unfair impeachment inquiry.''  In that simple statement, OMB admitted several key points. First, Mr.  Cipollone's letter of October 8 was an official directive from the  White House.  Second, President Trump's blanket order applied to OMB and the three  officials subpoenaed by the House.  Third, President Trump's blanket order not only directed them to  refuse to participate voluntarily; it also directed them to defy House  subpoenas.  Fourth, President Trump's blanket order directly prevented the three  OMB officials from providing testimony to the House.  There is no question about the scope of President Trump's order. It  was total. There is no question about the intent of the order. It was  clearly understood by administration officials, as shown by OMB. And  there is no question the order had an impact. It directly prevented the  House from getting testimony from the three senior officials at OMB.  So here we are. The President of the United States issued an official  order forbidding every single person who works for the executive branch  of our government from giving testimony to the House as part of an  impeachment investigation. That order prevented the House from getting  testimony from witnesses who knew about the President's conduct.  The matter is simple. It is plain to see. The question we here in  Congress must ask is whether we are prepared to turn a blind eye to a  President's obstruction--obstruction not only of oversight but also the  power to determine whether Congress may gather evidence in an  impeachment proceeding.  If the Senate is prepared to accept that, it will mean that not only  President Trump but all Presidents after him will have veto power over  Congress's ability to conduct oversight and the power of impeachment.  The House was not prepared to accept that, and that is why the House  approved article II.  As you consider what you think about this, please know that President  Trump's blanket order was not the end of his campaign to obstruct the  impeachment inquiry. Actually, it was just the beginning.  In addition to his total ban of government witnesses, President Trump  also sent specific explicit orders. He directed key witnesses to defy  subpoenas and to refuse to testify as part of the House's impeachment  inquiry.  As you know, the House subpoenaed Acting White House Chief of Staff  Mick Mulvaney. We wanted his testimony.  At a White House press briefing in October--I know you have seen it  before--Mr. Mulvaney confirmed what we had suspected. Mr. Mulvaney  admitted that President Trump withheld the aid to pressure Ukraine into  announcing an investigation into the conspiracy theory that Ukraine  interfered in the 2016 elections. Here are his words.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)    ", "Mr. GOWDY": " Mr. GOWDY. I can just tell you in the private interviews   there is never any of what you saw Thursday. It is one hour   on the Republican side, one hour on the Democrat side--which   is why you are going to see the next two dozen interviews   done privately. Look at the other investigations being done   right now. The Lois Lerner investigation that was just   announced, was that public or private?  Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. If this process was good enough for other  Presidents, why isn't it good enough for President Trump?  Representative Gowdy finished that statement by saying: ``The private  ones have always produced the best results.'' ``The private ones,''  according to Trey Gowdy, ``have always produced the best results.''  President Trump complained that his counsel was not afforded the  opportunity to participate during the Intel Committee's proceedings.  But neither President Nixon nor President Clinton were permitted to  have counsel participate in the initial fact-gathering stages [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S558\">Page S558</a>, ] when they were investigated by special counsel, independent counsel.  President Nixon certainly had no attorney present when the  prosecutors and grand juries began collecting evidence about Watergate  and related matters. President Nixon did not have an attorney present  in this distinguished body when the Senate Select Committee on  Watergate began interviewing witnesses and holding public hearings. Nor  did President Clinton have an attorney present when prosecutors from  the Office of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr deposed witnesses and  elicited their testimony before a grand jury.  President Trump's attorney could have cross-examined the Intel  Committee's counsel during his presentation of evidence before the  House Judiciary Committee. That would have functioned as the equivalent  opportunity afforded to President Clinton to have his counsel cross- examine Kenneth Starr, which he did, at length.  President Trump was provided a level of transparency and the  opportunity to participate consistent with the highest standards of due  process and fairness given to other Presidents who found themselves in  the midst of an impeachment inquiry.  The President--and I am winding down--the President's next procedural  complaint is that it was unconstitutional to exclude agency counsel  from participating in congressional depositions. The basis for the rule  excluding agency counsel is straightforward. It prevents agency  officials who are directly implicated in the abuses Congress is  investigating from trying to prevent their own employees from coming  forward to tell Congress and the American people the truth. It is  common sense. The rule protects the rights of witnesses by allowing  them to be accompanied in depositions by personal counsel, a right that  was afforded to all of the witnesses who appeared in this matter.  Agency attorneys have been excluded from congressional depositions of  executive branch officials for decades under both Republicans and  Democrats, including Republican Chairman Dan Burton, Republican  Chairman Darrell Issa, Republican Chairman Jason Chaffetz, Republican  Chairman Trey Gowdy, Republican Chairman Kevin Brady, and Republican  Chairman Jeb Hensarling, just to name a few.  Again, the Constitution provides the House with the sole power of  impeachment and the sole authority to determine the rules of its  proceedings, which were fair to all involved. Given the Constitution's  clarity on this point, the President's argument that he can engage in  blanket obstruction is just dead wrong.  President Trump also objects that the House minority lacked  sufficient subpoena rights. But the subpoena rules that were applied in  the Trump impeachment inquiry were put into place by my good friends  and colleagues on the other side of the aisle, House Republicans, when  they were in the majority. We are playing by the same rules devised by  our Republican colleagues.  President Nixon did not engage in blanket obstruction. President  Clinton did not engage in blanket obstruction. No President of the  United States has ever acted this way.  Lastly, we should reject President Trump's suggestion that he can  conceal all evidence of misconduct based on unspecified confidentiality  interests. Those are his exact words, ``confidentiality interests.''  Not once in the entire impeachment inquiry did he ever actually invoke  executive privilege.  Perhaps that is because executive privilege cannot be invoked to  conceal evidence of wrongdoing. Perhaps that is because executive  privilege does not permit blanket obstruction that includes blocking  documents and witnesses from the entire executive branch. Perhaps  President Trump didn't invoke executive privilege because it has never  been accepted as a sufficient basis for completely and totally defying  all impeachment inquiries and subpoenas. Or perhaps President Trump  didn't invoke executive privilege because when President Nixon did so,  he lost decisively, unanimously, clearly before the Supreme Court.  Whatever the explanation, President Trump never invoked executive  privilege. So it is not a credible defense to his obstruction of  Congress.  President Trump has lastly suggested that his obstruction is  justified because his top aides are ``absolutely immune'' from being  compelled to testify before Congress. Every Federal court to consider  the so-called doctrine of ``absolute immunity'' has rejected it.  In 2008, a Federal court rejected an assertion by the 43rd President  of the United States that White House Counsel Harriet Miers was immune  from being compelled to testify, noting that the President had failed  to point to a single judicial opinion to justify that claim.  And on November 25 of last year, another Federal judge rejected  President Trump's claim of absolute immunity for former White House  Counsel Don McGahn. The court concluded:  Executive branch officials are not absolutely immune from   compulsory congressional process--no matter how many times   the Executive branch has asserted as much over the years--  even if the President expressly directs such officials [not   to comply].  The court added: ``[Simply stated], the primary takeaway from the  past 250 [-some-odd] years of recorded American history is that  Presidents are not kings.''  The President is not a King.  President Trump tried to cheat. He got caught, and then he worked  hard to cover it up. He must be held accountable for abusing his power.  He must be held accountable for obstructing Congress. He must be held  accountable for breaking his promise to the American people.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  My foreign policy will always put the interests of the   American people and American security above all else. Has to   be first, has to be. That will be the foundation of every   single decision that I will make.  Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. What does it mean to put America First? America  is a great country, but, above all else, I think America is an idea--a  precious idea. It is an idea that has withstood the test of time--an  enduring idea--year after year, decade after decade, century after  century, as we continue a long, necessary, and majestic march toward a  more perfect Union. America is an idea: one person, one vote; liberty  and justice for all; equal protection under the law; government of the  people, by the people, and for the people; the preeminence of the rule  of law. America is an idea. We can either defend that idea or we can  abandon it. God help us all if we choose to abandon it.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.  RECESS    ", "Mr. TURNER": " Mr. TURNER. Did the Ukrainians ever tell you that they   understood that they would not get a meeting with the   President of the United States, a phone call with the   President of the United States, military aid, or foreign aid   from the United States unless they undertook investigations   of Burisma, the Bidens, or the 2016 elections?  Ambassador VOLKER. No, they did not.  Mr. Counsel PURPURA. The House managers never told you any of this.  Why not? Why didn't they show you this testimony? Why didn't they tell  you about this testimony? Why didn't they put Ambassador Sondland's  testimony in its full and proper context for your consideration?  Because none of this fits their narrative, and it wouldn't lead to  their predetermined outcome.  Thank you for your attention.  I yield to Mr. Sekulow.  Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Majority Leader McConnell,  Democratic Leader Schumer, House managers, Members of the Senate, let  me begin by saying that you cannot simply decide this case in a vacuum.  Mr. Schiff said yesterday--I believe it was his father who said it-- you should put yourself in someone else's shoes. Let's, for a moment,  put ourselves in the shoes of the President of the United States right  now.  Before he was sworn into office, he was subjected to an investigation  by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, called Crossfire Hurricane. The  President, within 6 months of his inauguration, found a special counsel  being appointed to investigate a Russia collusion theory. In their  opening statement, several Members of the House managers tried to, once  again, relitigate the Mueller case.  Here is the bottom line: This is part 1 of the Mueller report. This  part alone is 199 pages. The House managers, in their presentation, a  couple of times referenced a ``this for that.'' Let me tell you  something. This cost $32 million. This investigation took 2,800  subpoenas. This investigation had 500 search warrants. This had 230  orders for communication records. This had 500 witness interviews--all  to reach the following conclusion.  I am going to quote from the Mueller report itself--it can be found  on page 173--as relates to this whole matter of collusion and  conspiracy: ``Ultimately,'' in the words of Bob Mueller in his report,  ``the investigation did not establish that the campaign coordinated or  conspired with the Russian Government in its election interference  activities.''  Let me say that again. This, the Mueller report, resulted in this-- that for this: ``Ultimately, the investigation did not establish that  the campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian Government in  its election [-related] interference activities''--this for that.  In his summation on Thursday night, Manager Schiff complained that  the President chose not to go with the determination of his  intelligence agencies regarding hard interference and instead decided  that he would listen to people he trusted and he would inquire about  the Ukraine issue himself. Mr. Schiff did not like the fact that the  President did not apparently blindly trust some of the advice he was  being given by the intelligence agencies.  First of all, let me be clear. Disagreeing with the President's  decision on foreign policy matters or whose advice he is going to take  is in no way an impeachable offense.  Second, Mr. Schiff and Mr. Nadler, of all people--because they  chaired significant committees--really should know this, and they  should know what is happening.  Let me remind you of something: Just six-tenths of a mile from this  Chamber sits the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, also known as  the FISA Court. It is the Federal court established and authorized  under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to oversee requests by  Federal agencies for surveillance orders against foreign spies inside  the United States, including American citizens.  Because of the sensitive nature of its business, the court is a more  secret [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S573\">Page S573</a>, ] court. Its hearings are closed to the public. In this court, there are  no defense counsel, no opportunity to cross-examine witnesses, and no  ability to test evidence. The only material the court ever sees are  those materials that are submitted on trust--on trust--by members of  the intelligence community, with the presumption that they would be  acting in good faith.  On December 17, 2019, the FISA Court issued a scathing order in  response to the Justice Department inspector general's report on the  FBI's Crossfire Hurricane investigation into whether or not the Trump  campaign was coordinating with Russia. We already know the conclusion.  That report detailed the FBI's pattern of practice, systematic abuses  of obtaining surveillance order requests, and the process they  utilized.  In its order--this is the order from the court. I am going to read  it. ``This order responds to reports that personnel of the Federal  Bureau of Investigation provided false information to the National  Security Division of the Department of Justice, and withheld material  information from the NSD which was detrimental to the FBI's case in  connection with four applications to the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Court.''  When the FBI personnel misled NSD in the ways that are described in  these reports, they equally misled the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Court.  This order has been followed up. There has been another order. It was  declassified just a couple of days ago.  Thanks in large part--  The court said--  to the . . . Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department   of Justice, the Court has received notice of material   misstatements and omissions in the applications filed by the   government in the above-captioned documents. . . . DOJ   assesses that with respect to the applications in--  And it lists two specific docket numbers--  . . . 17-375 and 17-679, ``if not earlier, there was   insufficient predication to establish probable cause to   believe that [Carter] Page was acting as an agent of a   foreign power.''  The President had reason to be concerned about the information he was  being provided. Now, we could ignore this. We could make believe this  did not happen. But it did.  As we begin introducing our arguments, I want to correct a couple of  things in the record as well. That is what we are doing today. We  really intend to show for the next several days that the evidence is  actually really overwhelming that the President did nothing wrong.  Mr. Schiff and his colleagues repeatedly told you about the  intelligence community assessment that Russia was acting alone,  responsible for the election interference, implying that this somehow  debunked the idea that there might be, you know, interference from  other countries, including Ukraine. Mr. Nadler deployed a similar  argument, saying that President Trump thought ``Ukraine, not Russia,  interfered in our last Presidential election.'' And this is basically  what we call a straw man argument.  Let me be clear. The House managers, over a 23-hour period, kept  pushing this false dichotomy that it was either Russia or Ukraine but  not both. They kept telling you that the conclusion of the intelligence  community and Mr. Mueller was Russia alone with regard to the 2016  elections.  Of course, that is not--the report that Bob Mueller wrote focused on  Russian interference, although there is some information in letters  regarding Ukraine, and I am going to point to those in a few moments.  In fact, let me talk about those letters right now.  This is a letter dated May 4, 2018, to Mr. Yuriy Lutsenko, the  general prosecutor for the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine.  It was a letter requesting that his office cooperate with the Mueller  investigation involving issues involving the Ukraine Government and law  enforcement officials. It is signed by Senator Menendez, Senator Leahy,  and Senator Durbin.  I am doing this to put this in an entire perspective. House managers  tried to tell you that the importance--remember the whole discussion-- and my colleague Mr. Purpura talked about this--between President  Zelensky and President Trump and the bilateral meeting in the Oval  Office of the White House, as if an Article of Impeachment could be  based upon a meeting not taking place in the White House but taking  place someplace else, like the United Nations General Assembly, where  it, in fact, did take place.  Dr. Fiona Hill was quite clear in saying that a White House meeting  would supply the new Ukrainian Government with the ``legitimacy it  needed, especially vis-a-vis the Russians,'' and that Ukraine viewed  the White House meeting as a recognition of their legitimacy as a  sovereign state. But here is what they did not play. Here is what they  did not tell you. And I am going to quote from Dr. Hill's testimony on  page 145 of her transcript. These are her words. This is what she said  under oath:  It wasn't always a White House meeting per se, but   definitely a Presidential-level, you know, meeting with   Zelensky and the President. I mean, it could've taken place   in Poland, in Warsaw. It could have been, you know, a proper   bilateral in some other context. But, in other words, a White   House-level Presidential meeting.  That can be found on page 145.  Contrary to what Manager Schiff and some of the other managers told  you, this meeting did, in fact, occur. It occurred at the U.N. General  Assembly on September 25, 2019.  Those were the words of Dr. Hill's that you did not hear.  This case is really not about Presidential wrongdoing. This entire  impeachment process is about the House managers' insistence that they  are able to read everybody's thoughts, they can read everybody's  intentions even when the principal speakers, the witnesses themselves,  insist that those interpretations are wrong.  Manager Schiff, Managers Garcia and Demings relied heavily on  selected clips from Ambassador Sondland's testimony. I am not going to  replay those. My colleague Mr. Purpura played those for you. It is  clear. We are not going to play the same clips seven times. He said it.  You saw it. That is the evidence.  Ms. Lofgren said that, you know, numerous witnesses testified that-- and this is the quote--``that they were not provided with any reason  for why the hold was lifted on September 11,'' again suggesting that  the President's reason for the hold--Ukrainian corruption and burden- sharing--were somehow created after the fact. But, again, as my  colleague just showed you, burden-sharing was raised in the transcript  itself.  Mr. Schiff stated here that, just like the implementation of the  hold, President Trump provided no reason for the release. This also is  wrong.  In their testimony, Ambassadors Sondland and Volker said that the  President raised his concerns about Ukrainian corruption in the May 23,  2019, meeting with the Ukraine delegation.  Deputy Defense Secretary Laura Cooper testified that she received an  email in June of 2019 listing followups from a meeting between the  Secretary of Defense Chief of Staff and the President relating  specifically to Ukrainian security assistance, including asking about  what other countries are contributing. Burden-sharing. That can be  found in Laura Cooper's deposition, pages 33 and 34.  The President mentioned both corruption and burden-sharing to Senator  Johnson, as you already heard.  It is also important to note that, as Ambassador David Hale  testified, foreign aid generally was undergoing a review in 2019. From  page 84 of his November 6, 2019, testimony, he said the administration  ``did not want to take a, sort of, business-as-usual approach to  foreign assistance, a feeling that once a country has received a  certain assistance package, it's a--it's something that continues  forever.''  They didn't talk about that in the 23-hour presentation.  Dr. Fiona Hill confirmed this review and testified on November 23,  2019--I am going to again quote from page 75 of her testimony--that  ``there had been a directive for a whole-scale review of our foreign  policy--foreign policy assistance, and the ties between our foreign  policy objectives and that assistance. This had been going on actually  for many months.''  So multiple witnesses testified that the President had longstanding  concerns and specific concerns about Ukraine. The House managers  understandably--understandably--ignore the testimony that took place  before their own committees. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S574\">Page S574</a>, ]  In her testimony of October 14, 2019, Dr. Hill testified at pages 118  and 119 of her transcript that she thinks the President has actually  quite publicly said that he was very skeptical about corruption in  Ukraine. And then she said, again in her testimony, ``And, in fact,  he's not alone, because everyone has expressed great concerns about  corruption in Ukraine.''  Similarly, Ambassador Yovanovitch testified that they all had  concerns about corruption in Ukraine, and, as noted on page 142 of her  deposition transcript, when asked what she knew about the President's  deep-rooted skepticism about Ukraine's business environment, she  answered that President Trump delivered an anti-corruption message to  former Ukrainian President Poroshenko in their first meeting in the  White House on June 20, 2017.  NSC Senior Director Morrison confirmed on November 19, 2019, at page  63 in his testimony transcript, that--this was during the Volker,  Morrison public hearing--that he was aware that the President thought  Ukraine had a corruption problem--his words, again--and he continued,  ``as did many others familiar with Ukraine.''  According to her October 30, 2019, testimony, Special Advisor for  Ukraine Negotiations at the State Department, Catherine Croft, also  heard the President raise the issue of corruption directly with then  President Poroshenko of Ukraine during a bilateral meeting at the  United Nations General Assembly, this time in September of 2017.  Special Advisor Croft testified she also understood the President's  concern that ``Ukraine is corrupt'' because she has--these are her  words--tasked to write a paper to help then NSA head McMaster, General  McMaster, make the case to the President in connection with prior-- prior--security assistance.  These concerns were entirely justified. When asked--again, a quote  from Dr. Hill's October 14, 2019 hearing transcript, `` . . . certainly  eliminating corruption in Ukraine was one of if not the central goal of  [U.S.] foreign policy?''  Does anybody think that one election of one President that ran on a  reform platform who finally gets a majority in their legislative body  that corruption in Ukraine just evaporates?  That is like looking at this--it goes back to the Mueller report. You  can't look at these issues in a vacuum. Virtually every witness agreed  that confronting corruption is at the forefront of U.S. policy.  Now, I think there is some other things we have to understand about  the timing. This again is according to the testimony of Tim Morrison in  his testimony. This is when President Zelensky was first elected, and  these are his words. There was real ``concern about whether [he] would  be a genuine reformer'' and ``whether he would genuinely try to root  out corruption.''  It was also at this time, before the election, unclear whether  President Zelensky's party would actually be able to get a workable  majority. I think we are all glad that they did, but to say that that  has been tested or determined that corruption in Ukraine has been  removed, the Anticorruption Court of Ukraine did not commence its work  until September 5, 2019, 121 days ago--4 months ago. We are acting as  if there was a magic wand, that there was a new election and everything  was now fine.  I will not--because we are going to hear more about it--get into some  of the meetings the Vice President had. You will hear that in the days  ahead.  Manager Crow said this. What is most interesting to me about this was  that President Trump was only interested in Ukraine's aid--nobody else.  The U.S. provides aid to dozens of countries around the world, lots of  partners and allies. He didn't ask about any of them, just Ukraine.  I appreciate your service to our country, I really do. I didn't serve  in the military, and I appreciate that, but let's get our facts  straight.  That is what Manager Crow said. Here is what actually happened.  President Trump has placed holds on aid a number of times. It would  just take basic due diligence to figure this out. In September 2019,  the administration announced that it was withholding over $100 million  in aid to Afghanistan over concerns about government corruption. In  August 2019, President Trump announced that the administration and  Seoul were in talks to substantially increase South Korea's share-- burden sharing--of the expenses of U.S. military aid support for South  Korea.  In June, President Trump cut or paused over $550 million in foreign  aid to El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala because those countries  were not fairly sharing the burden of preventing mass migrations to the  United States.  In June, the administration temporarily paused $105 million in aid to  Lebanon. The administration lifted that hold in December, but one  official explained that the administration continually reviews and  thoroughly evaluates the effectiveness of all U.S. foreign assistance  to ensure that funds go toward activities that further U.S. foreign  policy and also further our national security interests, like any  administration would.  In September 2018, the administration canceled the $300 million in  military aid to Pakistan because it was not meeting its  counterterrorism obligations.  You didn't hear about any of that from my Democratic colleagues, the  House managers. None of that was discussed.  Under Secretary Hale, again, in his transcript said that, quote, aid  has been withheld from several countries ``across the globe'' for  various reasons.  Dr. Hill similarly explained that there was a freeze put on all kinds  of aid, also a freeze put on assistance because, in the process at the  time, there were an awful lot of reviews going on, on foreign  assistance. That is the Hill deposition transcript.  She added--this was one of the star witnesses of the managers--she  added that, in her experience, stops and starts are sometimes common in  foreign assistance and that the Office of Management and Budget holds  up dollars all the time, including the path for dollars going to  Ukraine in the past. Similarly, Ambassador Volker confirmed that aid  gets held up from time to time for a whole assortment of reasons.  Manager Crow told you that the President's Ukraine policy was not  strong against Russia, noting that we help our partner fight Russia  over there so we don't have to fight Russia over here. Our friends are  on the frontlines in trenches and with sneakers. This was following the  Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, ``the United States has stood by  Ukraine,'' and those are your words.  Well, it is true that the United States has stood by Ukraine since  the invasion of 2014. Only one President since then took a very  concrete step. Some of you supported it. That step included actually  providing Ukraine with lethal weapons including Javelin missiles. That  is what President Trump did. Some of you in this very room--some of you  managers--actually supported that.  Here is what Ambassador Taylor said that you didn't hear in the 23  hours. You didn't hear this. Javelin missiles are `` . . . serious  weapons. They kill Russian tanks.''  Ambassador Yovanovitch agreed, stating that Ukraine policy under  President Trump actually got stronger, stronger than it was under  President Obama.  There were talks about sanctions. President Trump has also imposed  heavy sanctions on Russia. President Zelensky thanked him.  The United States has imposed heavy sanctions on Russia. President  Zelensky thanked him.  Manager Jeffries said that the idea that Trump cares about corruption  is laughable. This is what Dr. Hill said. They didn't play this--`` . .  . eliminating corruption in Ukraine was one of, if the central goal of  U.S. foreign policy'' in Ukraine.  Let me say that again. Dr. Hill testified that ``eliminating  corruption in Ukraine was one of, if [not] the central goal of U.S.  foreign policy [in Ukraine].'' If you are taking notes, you can find  that in the Hill deposition transcript 34:7 through 13.  Dr. Hill also said that she thinks:  . . . [T]he President has actually quite publicly said that   he was very skeptical about corruption in Ukraine. And, in   fact, he's not alone, because everyone has expressed great   concerns about corruption in Ukraine.  Ambassador Yovanovitch--they didn't play this. She also said ``we all  had concerns.'' [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S575\">Page S575</a>, ]  National Security Director Morrison confirmed that he ``was aware  that the President thought Ukraine had a corruption problem, as did  many other people familiar with it.''  I am not going to continue to go over and over and over again the  evidence that they did not put before you because we would be here for  a lot longer than 24 hours, but to say that the President of the United  States was not concerned about burden sharing, that he was not  concerned about corruption in Ukraine, the facts from their hearing  established exactly the opposite.  The President wasn't concerned about burden sharing? Read all of the  records.  And then there was Mr. Schiff saying yesterday, maybe we can learn a  lot more from our Ukrainian ally.  Let me read you what our Ukrainian ally said. President Zelensky,  when asked about these allegations of quid pro quo, he said:  I think you read everything. I think you read the text. We   had a good phone call.  These are his words.  It was normal. We spoke about many things. And so, I think,   and you read it, that nobody pushed me.  They think you can read minds. I think you look at the words.  I would yield the balance of my time to my colleague, the deputy  White House counsel Pat Philbin. He is going to address two issues.  We are going to try to do this in a very systematic way in the days  ahead. No. 1, involving issues related to obstruction--because this  came at the end of theirs, so I want to do this in a sequence, as it  relates to some of the subpoenas that were issued. He is also going to  touch on some of the due process issues, since it was at the end of  theirs and is fresh in everybody's minds.  Mr. Chief Justice.  Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, Majority Leader  McConnell, Democratic Leader Schumer: Good morning. As Mr. Sekulow  said, I am going to touch upon a couple of issues related to  obstruction and due process, just to hit on some points before we go  into more detail in the rest of our presentation.  I would like to start with one of the points that Manager Jeffries  focused a lot on toward the end of the presentation yesterday relating  to the obstruction charge in the second Article of Impeachment because  he tried to portray a picture of what he called ``blanket defiance,''  that there was a response from the Trump administration that was  simply: We won't cooperate with anything, we won't give you any  documents, we won't do anything, and it was blanket defiance really  without explanation. That was all there was. It was just an assertion  that we wouldn't cooperate.  And he said, and I pulled this from the transcript, that President  Trump's objections are not generally rooted in the law and are not  legal arguments.  That is simply not true. That is simply not true. In every instance,  when there was resistance to a subpoena, resistance to a subpoena for a  witness or for documents, there is a legal explanation and  justification for it.  For example, they focused a lot on an October 8 letter from the  Counsel for the President, Pat Cipollone, but they didn't show you the  October 18 letter, which is up on the screen now, that went through in  detail why subpoenas that had been issued by Manager Schiff's  committees were invalid because the House had not authorized their  committees to conduct any such inquiry or to subpoena information in  furtherance of it. That is because the House had not taken a vote to  authorize the committee to exercise the power of impeachment to issue  any compulsory process. I am going to get into that issue in just a  moment.  Not only was there a legal explanation--a specific reason for every  resistance, not just blanket defiance--every step that the  administration took was supported by an opinion from the Department of  Justice in the Office of Legal Counsel. Those are explained in our  brief, and the major opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel is  actually attached in our trial memorandum as an appendix.  Mr. Jeffries and other managers also suggested that the Trump  administration took the approach of no negotiation, a blanket refusal,  and no attempt to accommodate. That is also not true. That is also not  true. In the October 8 letter that Mr. Cipollone sent to Speaker  Pelosi, it said explicitly: ``If the Committees wish to return to the  regular order of oversight requests, we stand ready to engage in that  process as we have in the past, in a manner consistent with well- established bipartisan constitutional protections and a respect for the  separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution.''  It was Manager Schiff and his committees that did not want to engage  in any accommodation process. We had said that we were willing to  explore that.  The House managers have also asserted a number of times--this came up  in the first long night when we were here until 2 as well--that the  Trump administration never asserted executive privilege--never asserted  executive privilege. I explained at the time that that is technically  true but misleading--misleading because the rationale on which the  subpoenas were resisted never depended on an assertion of executive  privilege.  Each of the rationales that we have offered--and I will go into one  of them today: that the House subpoenas were not authorized--does not  depend on making that formal assertion of executive privilege. It is a  different legal rationale. The subpoenas weren't authorized because  there was no vote, or the subpoenas were to senior advisers to the  President who are immune from congressional compulsion, or the  subpoenas were forcing executive branch officials to testify without  the presence of agency counsel, which is a separate legal infirmity  again supported by an opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel at the  Department of Justice.  Let me turn to the specific issue of the invalidity of the subpoenas  because they weren't supported by a vote of the House authorizing  Manager Schiff's committee to exercise the power of impeachment to  issue compulsory process.  Manager Jeffries said that there were no Supreme Court precedents  suggesting such a requirement and that every investigation into a  Presidential impeachment in history has begun without a vote from the  House, and those statements simply aren't accurate.  There is Supreme Court precedent explaining very clearly the  principle that a committee of either House of Congress gets its  authority only by a resolution from the parent body. United States v.  Rumely and Watkins v. United States make this very clear. And it is  common sense. The Constitution assigns the sole power of impeachment to  the House of Representatives--to the House, not to any Member and not  to a subcommittee--and that authority can be delegated to a committee  to use only by a vote of the House.  It would be the same here in the Senate. The Senate has the sole  power to try impeachments. But if there were no rules that had been  adopted by the Senate, would you think that the majority leader himself  could simply decide that he would have a committee receive evidence,  handle that, submit a recommendation to the Senate, and that would be  the way the trial would occur, without a vote from the Senate to give  authority to that committee? I don't think so. It doesn't make sense.  That is not the way the Constitution assigns that authority, and it is  the same in the House.  Here, there was no vote to authorize the committee to exercise the  power of impeachment. And this law has been boiled down by the DC  Circuit in Exxon Corp. v. FTC to explain it this way: ``To issue a  valid subpoena, . . . a committee or subcommittee must conform strictly  to the resolution establishing its investigatory powers.''  There must be a resolution voted on by the parent body to give the  committee that power. And the problem here is, there is no standing  rule. There was no standing authority giving Manager Schiff's committee  the authority to use the power of impeachment to issue compulsory  process. Rule X of the House discusses legislative authority. It  doesn't mention impeachment. That is why, in every Presidential  impeachment in history, the House has initiated the inquiry by voting  to give a committee the authority to pursue that inquiry.  Contrary to what Manager Jeffries suggested, there has always been,  in [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S576\">Page S576</a>, ] every Presidential impeachment inquiry, a vote from the full House to  authorize the committee, and that is the only way the inquiry begins.  There were three different votes for the impeachment of President  Andrew Johnson--in January 1867, in March 1867, and in February 1868.  For President Nixon, Chairman Rodino of the House Judiciary Committee  explained--there was a move to have them issue subpoenas after the  Saturday Night Massacre, and they determined that they did not have  that authority in the House Judiciary Committee without a vote from the  House, and he determined, as he explained, that ``such a resolution has  always been passed by the House. . . . It is a necessary step if we are  to meet our obligations.''  There has been reference to investigatory activities starting in the  House Judiciary Committee in the Nixon impeachment prior to the vote  from the House, but all that the committee was doing was assembling  publicly available information and information that had been gathered  by other congressional committees. There was never an attempt to issue  compulsory process until there had been a vote by the House to give the  House Judiciary Committee that authority.  Similarly, in the Clinton impeachment, there were two votes from the  full House to give the House Judiciary Committee authority to proceed:  first a vote on resolution 525 just to allow the committee to examine  the independent counsel report and make recommendations on how to  proceed and then a separate resolution, \", H. Res. 581, \", that gave the  House Judiciary Committee subpoena authority.  At the time, in the House report, the House Judiciary Committee  explained:  Because the issue of impeachment is of such overwhelming   importance, the committee decided that it must receive   authorization from the full House before proceeding on any   further course of action. Because impeachment is delegated   solely to the House of Representatives by the Constitution,   the full House of Representatives should be involved in   critical decisionmaking regarding various stages of   impeachment.  Here, the House Democrats skipped over that step completely. What  they had instead was simply a press conference with Speaker Pelosi  announcing that she was directing committees to proceed with an  impeachment inquiry against the President of the United States.  Speaker Pelosi didn't have the authority to delegate the power of the  House to those committees on her own. So why does it matter? It matters  because the Constitution places that authority in the House and ensures  that there is a democratic check on the exercise of that authority and  that there will have to be a vote by the full House before there can be  a proceeding to start inquiring into impeaching the President of the  United States.  One of the things that the Framers were most concerned about in  impeachment was the potential for a partisan impeachment--a partisan  impeachment that was being pushed merely by a faction--and a way to  ensure a check on that is to require democratic accountability from the  full House, to have a vote from the entire House before any impeachment  can proceed. That didn't happen here. It was only after 5 weeks of  hearings that the House decided to have a vote.  What that meant, at the outset, was that all of the subpoenas that  were issued under the law of the Supreme Court cases I discussed--all  those subpoenas were invalid, and that is what the Trump administration  pointed out specifically to the House. That was the reason for not  responding to them, because under long-settled precedent, there had to  be a vote from the House to give authority, and the administration  would not respond to subpoenas that were invalid.  The next point I would like to touch on briefly has to do with due  process because we heard from the House managers that they offered the  President due process at the House Judiciary Committee. Manager Nadler  described it as that he sent the President a letter--the President's  counsel a letter--offering to allow the President to participate, and  the President's counsel just refused, as if that was the only exchange,  and there was just a blanket refusal to participate.  Let me explain what actually happened. I should note before I get  into those details that there was a suggestion also that due process is  not required in the House proceeding and that it is simply a privilege,  but that wasn't the position Manager Nadler has taken in the past. In  2016, he said:  The power of impeachment is a solemn responsibility,   assigned to the House by the Constitution, and to this   committee by our peers. That responsibility demands a   rigorous level of due process.  In the Clinton impeachment in 1998, he explained:  What does due process mean? It means, among other things,   the right to confront the witnesses against you, to call your   own witnesses, and to have the assistance of counsel.  Now, I think we all know that all of those rights were denied to the  President in the first two rounds of hearings--the first round of  secret hearings in the basement bunker where Manager Schiff had three  committees holding hearings and then in a round of public hearings to  take the testimony that had been screened in the basement bunker and  have it in a public televised setting, which was totally unprecedented  in any Presidential impeachment inquiry--in both the Clinton and the  Nixon inquiries. For every public hearing, the President was allowed to  be represented by counsel and cross-examine witnesses.  But the House managers say that is all right because when we got to  the third round of hearings, after people had testified twice, then we  were going to allow the President to have some due process. But the way  that played out was this: First, they scheduled a hearing for December  4 that was going to hear solely from law professors. By the time they  wanted the President to commit whether he would participate, it was  unclear--they couldn't specify how many law professors or who the law  professors were going to be, and the President's counsel wrote back and  declined to participate in that.  But at the same time, Manager Nadler had asked what other rights  under the \", House Resolution 660, \"--the rules governing the House inquiry-- the President would like to exercise. The President's counsel wrote  back asking specific questions in order to be able to make an informed  decision and asked whether you intend to allow fact witnesses to be  called, including the witnesses who had been requested by HPSCI Ranking  Member Nunes; whether you intend to allow members of the Judiciary  Committee and the President's counsel a right to cross-examine fact  witnesses; and whether your Republican colleagues on the Judiciary  Committee will be allowed to call witnesses of their choosing. Manager  Nadler didn't respond to that letter. There wasn't information  provided.  We had discussions with the staff on the Judiciary Committee to try  to find out what were the plans and what were the hearings going to be  like. The way the week played out, on December 4, there was the hearing  with the law professors--the first hearing before the Judiciary  Committee--and on December 5, the morning of December 5, Speaker Pelosi  announced the conclusion of the entire Judiciary Committee process  because she announced that she was directing Chairman Nadler to draft  Articles of Impeachment. So the conclusion of the whole process was  already set.  Then, after the close of business on the 5th, we learned from the  staff that the committee had no plans, other than a hearing on December  9, to hear from staffers who had prepared HPSCI committee reports. They  had no plans to have other hearings, no plans to hear from fact  witnesses, and no plans to do any factual investigation.  So the President was given a choice of participating in a process  that was going to already have the outcome determined--the Speaker had  already said Articles of Impeachment were going to be drafted--and  there were no plans to hear from any fact witnesses. That is not due  process. That is why the President declined to participate in that  process, because the Judiciary Committee had already decided they were  going to accept an ex parte record developed in Manager Schiff's  process, and there was no point in participating in that. So the idea  that there was due process offered to the President is simply not  accurate.  The entire proceedings in the House, from the time of the September 4  press conference until the Judiciary Committee began marking up  Articles of [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S577\">Page S577</a>, ] Impeachment on December 11, lasted 78 days. It is the fastest  investigatory process for a Presidential impeachment in history.  For 71 days of that process, for 71 days of the hearing and taking of  depositions and hearing testimony, the President was completely locked  out. He couldn't be represented by counsel. He couldn't cross-examine  witnesses. He couldn't present evidence. He couldn't present witnesses  for 71 of the 78 days. That is not due process.  It goes to a point that Mr. Cipollone raised earlier. Why would you  have a process like that? What does that tell you about the process?  As we pointed out a couple of times, cross-examination in our legal  system is regarded as the greatest legal engine ever invented for the  discovery of truth. It is essential. The Supreme Court has said in  Goldberg v. Kelly, for any determination that is important, that  requires determining facts, cross-examination has been one of the keys  for due process.  Why did they design a mechanism here where the President was locked  out and denied the ability to cross-examine witnesses? It is because  they weren't really interested in getting at the facts and the truth.  They had a timetable to meet. They wanted to have impeachment done by  Christmas, and that is what they were striving to do.  Now, as a slight shift in gears, I want to touch on one last point  before I yield to one of my colleagues, and that relates to the  whistleblower--the whistleblower, whom we haven't heard that much  about--who started all of this. We know from a letter that the  inspector general of the intelligence community sent that he thought  the whistleblower had political bias. We don't know exactly what the  political bias was because the inspector general testified in the House  committee in an executive session, and that transcript is still secret.  It wasn't transmitted up to the House Judiciary Committee. We haven't  seen it. We don't know what is in it. We don't know what he was asked  and what he revealed about the whistleblower.  Now, you would think that before going forward with an impeachment  proceeding against the President of the United States, that you would  want to find out something about the complaint that had started this,  because motivations, bias, reasons for wanting to bring this complaint  could be relevant. But there wasn't any inquiry into that.  Recent reports, public reports suggest that, potentially, the  whistleblower was an intelligence community staffer who worked with  then-Vice President Biden on Ukraine matters, which, if true, would  suggest an even greater reason for wanting to know about potential bias  or motive for the whistleblower.  At first, when things started, it seemed like everyone agreed that we  should hear from the whistleblower, including Manager Schiff.  I think we have what he said.

", "Ms. STEFANIK": " Ms. STEFANIK. Defensive lethal aid.  Ambassador TAYLOR. Yes.  Ambassador VOLKER. President Trump approved each of the   decisions made along the way, providing lethal defensive   equipment.  Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. And the Trump administration   strengthened our policy by approving the provision to Ukraine   of antitank missiles known as Javelins.  They are obviously tank busters. And so, if the war with   Russia all--all of a sudden accelerated in some way and tanks   come over the horizon, Javelins are a very serious weapon to   deal with that.  Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Ukraine is better positioned to fight Russia  today than it was before President Trump took office. As a result, the  United States is safer too. The House managers did not tell you about  this testimony from Ambassadors Taylor, Volker, and Yovanovitch. Why  not?  These are the facts, as drawn from the House managers' own record on  which they impeached the President. This is why the House managers'  first Article of Impeachment must fail, for the six reasons I set forth  when I began on Saturday:  There was no linkage between investigations and security assistance  or a meeting on the July 25 call. The Ukrainians said there was no quid  pro quo and they felt no pressure. The top Ukrainians did not even know  that security assistance was paused until more than a month after the  July 25 call. The House managers' record reflects that anyone who spoke  with the President said that the President made clear that there was no  linkage. The security assistance flowed, and the Presidential meeting  took place, all without any announcement of investigations. And  President Trump has enhanced America's support for Ukraine in his 3  years in office.  These facts all require that the first Article of Impeachment fail.  You have already heard and will continue to hear from my colleagues on  why the second article must fail. Once again, this is the case that the  House managers chose to bring. This is the evidence they brought before  the Senate.  The very heavy burden of proof rests with them. They say their case  is overwhelming and uncontested. It is not. They say they have proven  each of the articles against President Trump. They have not. The facts  and evidence of the case the House managers have brought exonerate the  President.  Thank you for your attention.  Mr. Chief Justice, I think we are ready for a break.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.  Recess    ", "Mr. CASTOR": " Mr. CASTOR. To the best of your knowledge, there was no   malicious intent in moving the transcript to the   compartmented server?    ", "Mr. HURD": " Mr. HURD. It wasn't until the POLITICO article?

The principle of fair burden-sharing by allies   and other like-minded states is an important element of the   foreign assistance review.  Mr. Counsel PURPURA. The President expressed these precise concerns  to Senator Ron Johnson, who wrote:  He reminded me how thoroughly corrupt Ukraine was and again   conveyed his frustration that Europe doesn't do its fair   share of providing military aid.  The House managers didn't tell you about this. Why not? And President  Trump was right to be concerned that other countries weren't paying  their fair share. As Laura Cooper testified, U.S. contributions to  Ukraine are far more significant than any individual country, and she  also said EU funds tend to be on the economic side rather than for  defense and security. Senator Johnson also confirmed that other  countries refused to provide the lethal defensive weapons that Ukraine  needs in its war with Russia.  Please keep in mind also that the pause of the Ukraine security  assistance program was far from unusual or out of character for  President Trump. The American people know that the President is  skeptical of foreign aid and that one of his top campaign promises and  priorities in office has been to avoid wasteful spending of American  taxpayer dollars abroad.  Meanwhile, the same people who today claimed that President Trump was  not genuinely concerned about burden-sharing were upset when, as a  candidate, President Trump criticized free-riding by NATO members.  This past summer, the administration paused, reviewed, and in some  cases canceled hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid to  Afghanistan, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Lebanon. These are  just some of the reviews of foreign aid undertaken at the very same  time that the Ukraine aid was paused.  So what happened during the brief period of time while the Ukraine  security assistance was paused? People were gathering information and  monitoring the facts on the ground in Ukraine as the new Parliament was  sworn in and began introducing anti-corruption legislation.  Notwithstanding what the House managers would have you believe, the  reason for the pause was no secret within the White House and the  agencies. According to Mr. Morrison, in a July meeting attended by  officials throughout the executive branch agencies, the reason provided  for the pause by a representative of the Office of Management and  Budget was that the President was concerned about corruption in Ukraine  and he wanted to make sure Ukraine was doing enough to manage that  corruption. In fact, as Mr. Morrison testified, by Labor Day, there had  been definitive developments to demonstrate that President Zelensky was  committed to the issues he campaigned on: anti-corruption reforms.  Mr. Morrison also testified that the administration was working on  answering the President's concerns regarding burden-sharing. Here is  Mr. Morrison.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)    ", "Ms. ROBACH": " Ms. ROBACH. If your last name wasn't Biden, do you think   you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma?  Mr. Hunter BIDEN. I don't know. Probably no. I don't think   there are a lot of things that would have happened in my life   if my last name wasn't Biden.  Mr. Counsel HERSCHMANN. And as if to confirm how suspect this conduct  was that it should be a concern to our country, Hunter Biden and his  lawyer could not even keep their story straight. Compare the press  release that was issued by Burisma on May 12, 2014, with Hunter Biden's  lawyer's statement on October 13 of 2019. The May 2014 press release  begins: ``R. [Robert] Hunter Biden will be in charge of holding's legal  unit.'' He was going to be in charge of a Ukrainian gas company owned  by an oligarch's legal unit. However, in his lawyer's statement in  October of 2019, after his involvement with Burisma came under renewed  public scrutiny, he now claims: ``At no [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S600\">Page S600</a>, ] time was Hunter in charge of the company's legal affairs.''  Which is it? What was Hunter Biden doing at Burisma in exchange for  millions of dollars? Who knows? What were they looking to hide so much  for his corporate governance and transparency?  But let's take a step back and realize what actually transpired,  because the House managers would have us believe this had nothing at  all to do with our government, nothing at all to do with our country's  interests, nothing at all to do with our Vice President, nothing at all  to do with the State Department. It was simply private citizen Hunter  Biden doing his own private business. It was purely coincidental that  it was in his father's portfolio in Ukraine, in the exact sector--the  energy sector--that his father said was corrupt.  But we have a document here--again, something that House managers did  not show you or even put before the House before voting on these  baseless Articles of Impeachment. If you look at that email, it is an  email from Chris Heinz. And as Attorney Bondi already told you, he is  the stepson of the then-Secretary of State John Kerry, and he was the  other business partner with Hunter Biden and Devon Archer. Our  Secretary of State's stepson and our Vice President's son are in  business together.  It was sent on May 13, 2014, to the official government email  addresses of two senior people at the State Department. These two  people are the Chief of Staff to the Secretary of State and the Special  Adviser to the Secretary of State. The subject line in the email is not  ``corporate transparency.'' It is not ``corporate governance.'' It is  not ``here's a heads-up.'' The subject line is ``Ukraine.''  Chris Heinz certainly understood the sensitivity to our U.S. foreign  policy. What does the Secretary of State's stepson say about Hunter  Biden and Devon Archer? He says this:  Apparently Devon and Hunter both joined the board of   Burisma and a press release went out today. I can't speak to   why they decided to, but there was no investment by our firm   in their company.  What is the most telling thing about this? It is clear that the Chief  of Staff and the Special Assistant to the Secretary already knew who  Devon was because Mr. Heinz did not include his last name. It is just  ``Devon.'' They obviously knew who Hunter was because, again, it is  Hunter Biden. This is Chris Heinz saying: ``I can't speak to why they  decided to join the board of Burisma.'' He is their business partner-- not that there were good corporate reasons that they are going there  for corporate governance, not that they are there to enhance corporate  transparency, not that they are there to further U.S. policy, not that  they are there to help fight corruption in Ukraine, not that they are  there to ensure boards of directors' compensation and benefits are  publicly disclosed--nothing like that. He cannot say those things  because he knows Devon and Hunter well and he knows they have no  particular qualifications, whatsoever, to do those things, especially  for a Ukrainian gas company.  Instead, Mr. Heinz is planning to go on the record to report what  Hunter and Devon were doing through official channels to take pains to  disassociate himself from what they were doing. And what did the State  Department do with this information that the Secretary of State's  stepson thought they needed to know? Apparently, nothing. They did not  tell Mr. Heinz to stay away. They did not tell Mr. Heinz there is no  problem--nothing. But all this, the House managers want us to believe,  does not even merit any inquiry. Anyone asking for one, anyone  discussing one is now corrupt.  Does it matter in an inquiry why a corrupt company in a corrupt  country would be paying our Vice President son's a million dollars per  year, plus, it appears, some additional expenses, and paying his  business partner an additional million dollars per year? Secretary of  State Kerry's stepson thought it was important enough to report. Why  aren't the House managers concerned?  And I ask you, why would it not merit an investigation? You know  something else about Vice President Biden? Well, back in January of  2018, as you heard, former Vice President Biden bragged that he had  pressured the Ukrainians--threatened them, indeed, coerced them--into  firing the state prosecutor who reportedly was investigating the very  company that paid millions of dollars to his son. He bragged that he  gave them 6 hours to fire the prosecutor or he would cut off $1 billion  in U.S. loan guarantees.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Vice President BIDEN. I said: We're not going to give you   the billion dollars.  They said: You have no authority. You're not the President.   The President said--  I said: Call him. I said: I'm telling you, you're not   getting the billion dollars. I said: You're not getting the   billion. I'm going to be leaving here in--I think it was,   what--6 hours. I looked at him and said: I'm leaving in 6   hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the   money.  Well, son of a bitch, he got fired, and they put in place   someone who was solid at the time.  Mr. Counsel HERSCHMANN. Are we really to believe it was the policy of  our government to withhold $1 billion of guarantees to Ukraine unless  they fired a prosecutor on the spot? Was that really our policy? We  have all heard continuously from the managers and many agree about the  risks to the Ukrainians posed by the Russians. We have heard the  managers say that a slight delay in providing funding to Ukraine  endangers our national security and jeopardizes our interests and,  therefore, the President must immediately be removed from office. Yet,  they also argue that it was the official policy of our country to  withhold $1 billion unless one individual was fired within a certain  matter of hours. Was that really or could it ever be our United States  policy?  According to the House managers' theory, we were willing to  jeopardize Ukrainians unless somebody who happened to be investigating  Burisma was promptly fired. Are we going to jeopardize a Ukrainian  economy because a prosecutor was not fired in the 6-hour time period  Vice President Biden demanded? Does anyone really believe that was or  ever could be our U.S. foreign policy? And, just in case, the managers  or others tried to argue: No, no, no, he wasn't serious about that; he  was just bluffing. What kind of message would that send to the Russians  about our support for the Ukrainians that we would bluff and bluff with  the Ukrainian economy?  From 2014 to 2017, Vice President Biden claimed to be on a crusade  against corruption in Ukraine. He repeatedly spoke about how the cancer  of corruption was endemic in Ukraine, hobbled Ukraine, how Ukraine  faced no more consequential mission than confronting corruption, and he  encouraged Ukraine to close the space for corrupt middlemen who rip off  the Ukrainian people. The Vice President railed against monopolistic  behavior where a select few profit from so many sweetheart deals that  has characterized that country for so long.  On his last official visit to Ukraine, 4 days before he left office,  he spoke out against corruption and oligarchy, that eats away like a  cancer, and against corruption, which continues to eat away at  Ukraine's democracy within. Why was Vice President doing this? Was he  so concerned about corruption in Ukraine--even singling out that  country's energy sector--because corruption in Ukraine is a critical  policy concern for our country?  But during this whole time, what else was happening? His son and his  son's business partner were raking in over $1 million a year from what  was regarded as one of the most corrupt Ukrainian companies in the  energy sector, owned and controlled by one of the most corrupt  oligarchs. Were Vice President Biden's words and advice to Ukraine just  hollow? According to the House managers, the answer apparently is yes,  they were empty words, at least when it came to anyone questioning his  son's own sweetheart deal, his own son's deal with Ukraine's corruption  and oligarchy.  Again, to raise Manager Schiff's own question: What kind of message  did this send to future U.S. Government officials? Your family can  accept money from foreign corrupt companies? No problem. You can pay  family members of our highest government officials, and no one is  allowed to even ask questions.  What was going on? We have to just accept now the House managers'  conclusory statements, like ``sham,'' ``discrediting,'' even though no  one has [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S601\">Page S601</a>, ] ever investigated why. And can you imagine what House Manager Schiff  and his fellow Democratic Representatives would say if it were  President Trump's children on an oligarch's payroll?  And when it finally appeared that a true Ukrainian corruption fighter  had assumed the country's Presidency, President Trump was not supposed  to--he was not permitted to--- follow up on Vice President Biden's own  words about fighting corruption and try to make those words something  other than empty?  According to the House managers, Ukrainian corruption is now only a  private interest. It no longer is a serious important concern for our  country.  Now I want to take a moment to cover a few additional points about  the July 25 telephone call in which the House managers believe that the  President of the United States, in their words, was shaking down and  pressuring the President of Ukraine to do his personal bidding.  First of all, this was not the first telephone call that the  President of the United States had with other foreign leaders. Think  about this for a moment. The call was routed through the Situation  Room. It was a scheduled call. There were other people on the call.  There were other people taking notes. Obviously, the President was  aware of that fact.  The House managers talked about the fact that the President did not  follow the approved talking points as if the President--any President-- is obligated to follow approved talking points. The last time I  checked--and I think this is clear to the American people--President  Trump knows how to speak his mind.  Do you remember the fake transcript that Manager Schiff read when he  was before the Intelligence Committee--his mob, gangster-like, fake  rendition of the call? Well, I prosecuted organized crime for years.  The type of description of what goes on--what House Manager Schiff  tried to create for the American people--is completely detached from  reality. It is as if we were supposed to believe that mobsters would  invite people they do not know into an organized crime meeting to sit  around and take notes to establish their corrupt intent.  Manager Schiff, our jobs as prosecutors--and I know you were one-- would have been a lot easier if that were how it worked.  Think about what he is saying. Think about the managers' position:  that our President decided with corrupt intent to shake down, in their  words, another foreign leader, and he decided to do it in front of  everyone, in a documented conversation, in the presence of people he  did not even know, just so he could get this personal benefit that was  not in our country's interest. This logic is flawed--it is completely  illogical--because that is not what happened, and that is why Manager  Schiff ran away from the actual transcript. That is why he created his  own, fake conversation.  I would like to just address another point, for the transcript, of  the July 25 phone call.  The House managers alleged that an Oval Office meeting with the  President was critical to the newly elected Ukrainian President because  it would signal to Russia, which had invaded Ukraine in 2014 and still  occupied Ukrainian territory, that Ukraine could count on American  support. They actually argued that it was a quid pro quo, that the  President withheld this critical Oval Office meeting that would deter  the Russians and save the Ukrainians because he wanted something  personal.  Now, if that were, in fact, critical to President Zelensky for the  safety of his own citizens, he would have immediately jumped at the  opportunity to come to the Oval Office, especially when President Trump  offered him that invitation during the July 25 call. Let's see what  President Zelensky actually said when he was invited to Washington on  that call.  He does not say: Oh, this is what I would like to do. It is critical  for my people. We will arrange it in a meeting.  His response is:  I would be very happy to come and would be happy to meet   you personally and get to know you better . . . On the other   hand, I believe that, on September 1, we will be in Poland,   and we could meet in Poland, hopefully.  If an Oval Office meeting were critical to President Zelensky, that  was the time to say so, not to suggest another venue.  When we look at the evidence that is before us, it is clear that the  only people who talked about having an Oval Office meeting were lower  level government employees who thought it was a good idea. But for the  principals involved, those who actually make the decisions--President  Zelensky, President Trump--to them, it was not critical, it was not  material, and it was definitely never a quid pro quo. What was  important to President Zelensky was not an Oval Office meeting but the  lethal weapons that President Trump supplied to Ukraine and the  sanctions that President Trump enforced against the Russians. That is  what the transcript of the July 25 call demonstrates.  Let us now consider what President Zelensky knew about the support  that President Trump had provided to Ukraine compared to the support-- or more accurately, the lack thereof--that the prior administration had  provided to Ukraine.  In February 2004, Russia began its military campaign against Ukraine.  Against the advice and urgings of Congress and of many in his own  administration, President Obama refused then and throughout the  remainder of his Presidency to provide lethal assistance to Ukraine.  In the House, Manager Schiff joined many of his colleagues in a  letter-writing campaign to President Obama, urging ``the U.S. must  supply Ukraine with the means to defend itself'' against Russian  aggression, urging President Obama to quickly approve additional  efforts to support Ukraine's efforts to defend the sovereign territory,  including the transfer of lethal defense weapons to the Ukraine  military.  On March 23, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a  resolution urging President Obama to immediately exercise the authority  by Congress to provide Ukraine with a lethal defensive weapons system.  The very next day, this Senate passed a unanimous resolution urging  the President to prioritize and expedite the provision of defensive  lethal and nonlethal military assistance to Ukraine, consistent with  U.S. national interests and policies.  As one Senator here stated in March 2015, ``Providing nonlethal  equipment like night vision goggles is all well and good, but giving  the Ukrainians the ability to see the Russians coming but not the  ability to stop them is not the answer.''  Yet President Obama refused. He refused even in the face of support  by senior career professionals recommending he provide lethal weapons  to the Ukrainians.  By contrast, what did President Zelensky and the Russians know? They  knew that President Trump did--did--provide that support. That,  clearly, was the most material thing to him, much more important than a  meeting in the Oval Office.  The House managers also made much of the contention that President  Trump supposedly wanted President Zelensky only to announce an  investigation, not conduct it, but that contention makes no sense.  President Trump's call with President Zelensky was in July of 2019-- almost a year and a half before our next election. Would only a bare  announcement so far in advance, with no followup, really have had any  effect on the election, as the managers claim? Would anyone have  remembered the announcement a year or more later?  Ironically, it is the House managers who have put Burisma and its  connection to the Bidens front and center in this proceeding, and now  the voters will know about it and probably will remember it. Be careful  what you wish for.  Manager Schiff--well, there he goes again. He is putting words in the  President's mouth that were never there. Again, look at the transcript  of the July call. President Trump never asked about any announcement of  any type of investigation, and President Zelensky told President Trump:  I guarantee, as the President of Ukraine, that all the   investigations will be done openly and candidly. That I can   assure you.  What happened next?  The House managers say President Zelensky did not want to get mixed  up [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S602\">Page S602</a>, ] in U.S. politics, but it is precisely the Democrats who politicized the  issue.  Last August, they began circling the wagons in trying to protect Vice  President Biden, and they are still doing it in these proceedings. They  contend that any investigation into the millions of dollars of payments  by a corrupt Ukraine company--owned by a corrupt Ukraine oligarch--to  the son of the second highest officeholder in our land, who was  supposed to be in charge of fighting corruption in Ukraine, to be a  sham, debunked. But there has never been an investigation, so how could  it be a sham--simply because the House managers say so?  Which brings me to yet another one of the House managers' baseless  contentions--that President Trump raised the matter with President  Zelensky because Vice President Biden had just announced his candidacy  for President. But, of course, it was far from a secret that Vice  President Biden was planning to run.  What had, in fact, changed?  First, President Zelensky had been elected in April on an anti- corruption platform. In July, running on the same platform, his party  took control of the Ukrainian Parliament. That made it the opportune  time to raise the issue because finally there was a receptive  government in Ukraine that was committed to fighting precisely the kind  of highly questionable conduct displayed by Burisma in its payments to  Hunter Biden and his partner, just as Joe Biden had raised years  before.  There are two other things.  In late June, ABC News ran a story entitled ``Hunter   Biden's foreign deals. Did Joe Biden's son profit off of his   father's position as Vice President?''  Then, just a couple of weeks before President Trump's telephone call  with President Zelensky, the New Yorker magazine--not exactly a  supporter of President Trump's--ran an expose--``Will Hunter Biden  Jeopardize His Father's Campaign?''--and went through some of the facts  that we do know about Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma and his  involvement with the Chinese company.  The New Yorker reporter--again, this was in July, just a couple of  weeks before the phone call--said that some of Vice President Biden's  advisers were worried that Hunter would expose the Vice President to  criticism.  A former senior White House aide told the New Yorker reporter that  Hunter's behavior invited questions about whether he was ``leveraging  access for his benefit.'' The reporter wrote: ``When I asked members of  Biden's staff whether they did raise their concern with the Vice  President, several of them said they had been too intimidated to do  so.''  ``Everyone who works for him has been screamed at,'' a former adviser  told the reporter. ``I don't know whether anyone has been intimidated  by Vice President Biden or has been screamed at by him about Burisma or  his son's involvement.''  Do we want the type of government where questions about facially  suspect conduct are suppressed or dismissed as illegitimate because  someone is intimidating or screams or is just too important? No. That  is precisely when an investigation is most important.  Last Thursday night, Manager Jeffries provided us with the Democrats'  standard for abuse of power.  He said: ``Abuse of power occurs when the President exercises his  official power to obtain a corrupt personal benefit while ignoring or  injuring the national interest.''  Mr. Jeffries and the House managers contend that, under this  standard, President Trump has committed an impeachable offense and must  be immediately removed from office. But if Manager Jeffries' standard  applies, then where were these same Democrats' calls for impeachment  when uncontroverted, smoking-gun evidence emerged that President Obama  had violated their standard?  The American people understand this basic notion as equal justice  under the law. It is as American as apple pie. Yet the House managers  want to apply their own version of selective justice here, which  applies only to their political opponents. They want one system of  justice for Democrats and another system of justice for everyone else.  You do not need to take my word for it; let's walk through the facts.  On March 26, 2012, on the eve of the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit in  Seoul, South Korea, President Obama met with Russian President Dmitry  Medvedev to discuss one of the pressing issues in the U.S. national  security interests--missile defense.  How important was the issue of missile defense to the strategic  relationship between the United States and Russia?  As President Obama's Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in June  2010, upgraded missile interceptors in development ``would give us the  ability to protect our troops, our bases, our facilities and our allies  in Europe.''  Gates continued:  There is no meeting of the minds on missile defense. The   Russians hate it. They have hated it since the late 1960s.   They will always hate it, mostly because we will build it,   and they won't.  During the Nuclear Security Summit, President Obama had a private  exchange with Russian President Medvedev that was picked up on a hot  microphone.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  President OBAMA. This is my last election. After my   election, I have more flexibility.  President MEDVEDEV. I understand. I will transmit this   information to Vladimir, and I stand with you.  President Obama said:  On all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this   can be solved, but it's important for him to give me space.  President Medvedev responded:  Yeah, I understand. I understand your message about space.   Space for you.  President Obama:  This is my last election. After my election, I will have   more flexibility.  President Medvedev responds:  I understand. I will transmit this information to Vladimir.  As we all know, it is Vladimir Putin.  As you just saw in 2012, President Obama asked the Russians for space  until after the upcoming 2012 election, after which he would have more  flexibility.  Now, let me apply Mr. Jeffries' and the House managers' three-part  test for abuse of power.  One, the President exercises his official power. President Obama's  actions clearly meet the test for exercising official power because in  his role as head of state during the nuclear security summit, after  asking President Medvedev for space, he promised him that ``missile  defense can be solved.'' What else did that mean but solved in a way  favorable to the Russians, who were dead set against the expansion of a  U.S. missile defense system in Europe?  Two, to obtain a corrupt personal benefit. President Obama's actions  were clearly for his own corrupt personal benefit because he was asking  an adversary for space for the express purpose of furthering his own  election chances.  Again, President Obama said:  This is my last election. After my election, I have more   flexibility.  President Obama knew the importance of missile defense in Europe but  decided to use that as a bargaining chip with the Russians to further  his own election chances in 2012.  Three, while ignoring or injuring our national interest. As President  Obama's Defense Secretary said, ``Missiles would give us the ability to  protect our troops, our bases, our facilities, and our allies in  Europe.''  Surely, sacrificing the ability to protect our troops and our allies  would injure the national interest. Yet President Obama was willing to  barter away the safety of our troops and the safety of our allies in  exchange for space in the upcoming election.  In short, President Obama leveraged the power of his office to the  detriment of U.S. policy on missile defense in order to influence the  2012 election solely to his advantage. And we never would have known  had President Obama realized that the microphone was on; that there was  a hot mic.  One could easily substitute President Obama's 2012 exchange with  President Medvedev into article I of the House's Impeachment Articles  against President Trump.  Using the powers of his high office, President Obama solicited  interference of a foreign government, Russia, in the 2012 U.S.  Presidential election. He did so through a scheme or course of conduct  that included soliciting the Government of Russia to give him ``space''  on missile defense that would benefit [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S603\">Page S603</a>, ] his reelection and influence the 2012 U.S. Presidential election to his  advantage.  In doing so, President Obama used the powers of the Presidency in a  manner that compromised the national security of the United States and  undermined the integrity of the U.S. democratic process. He thus  ignored and injured the interest of the Nation.  Does it sound familiar, House managers? It should, as the case  against President Obama would have been far stronger than the  allegations against President Trump.  President Obama's abuse of power to benefit his own political  interests was there and is here now for everyone to hear. It was a  direct, unquestionable quid pro quo. No mind reading was needed there.  Where were the House managers then?  And that points out the absurdity of the House managers' case against  President Trump. It was President Obama, not President Trump, who was  weak on Russia and weak on support to Ukraine.  President Obama caved to Russia and Putin on missile defense when he  decided to scrap the U.S. plans to install missile bases in Poland. Yet  he criticized Senator Romney during the 2012 Presidential campaign when  Senator Romney said Russia was the greatest geopolitical threat to the  U.S.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  President OBAMA. I'm glad that you recognize that al-  Qaida's a threat because a few months ago when you were asked   what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you   said Russia. Not al-Qaida, you said Russia, and the 1980s are   now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you   know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.  Mr. Counsel HERSCHMANN. Now, when it is politically convenient, the  Democrats are saying the same thing that President Obama criticized  Senator Romney for saying. In fact, they are basing their entire  politicized impeachment on this inversion of reality, this claim that  President Trump is not supporting Ukraine far more than the prior  administration.  President Obama caved on missile defense in late 2009. His hot mic  moment occurred in March 2012. His reelection was 8 months later. Two  years later, in March 2014, Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea.  President Obama refused to provide lethal aid to Ukraine to enable it  to defend itself. Where were the House managers then?  The House managers would have the American people believe that there  is a threat--an imminent threat--to the national security of our  country for which the President must be removed immediately from the  highest office in the land because of what? Because he had a phone call  with a foreign leader and discussed corruption? Because he paused for a  short period of time giving away our tax dollars to a foreign country?  That is their theory.  It is absurd on its face. Not one American life was in jeopardy or  lost by this short delay, and they know it.  And how do we know that they know it? Because they went on vacation  after they adopted the Articles of Impeachment. They did not cancel  their recess. They did not rush back to deliver the Articles of  Impeachment to the Senate because of this supposed terrible imminent  threat to our national security. What did they do?  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Speaker PELOSI. Urgency.    ", "Mr. NADLER": " Mr. NADLER. My personal view is that he richly deserves   impeachment.  Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. One of the Members of the House of  Representatives said that we are bringing these Articles of Impeachment  so he doesn't get elected again.  Here we are, 10 months before an election, doing exactly what they  predicted. The whistleblower's lawyer, Mr. Zaid, sent out a tweet on  January 30, 2017.  Let me put that up on the screen:  The #coup has started. First of many steps. #rebellion.   #impeachment will follow ultimately.  And here we are.  What this body, what this Nation, and what this President have just  endured--what the House managers have forced upon this great body--is  unprecedented and unacceptable. This is exactly and precisely what the  Founders feared. This was the first totally partisan Presidential  impeachment in our Nation's history, and it should be our last.  What the House Democrats have done to this Nation, to the  Constitution, to the Office of the President, to the President himself,  and to this body is outrageous. They have cheapened the awesome power  of impeachment, and, unfortunately, of course, the country is not  better for that.  We urge this body to dispense with these partisan Articles of  Impeachment for the sake of the Nation, for the sake of the  Constitution.  As we have demonstrably proved, the articles are flawed on their  face. They were the product of a reckless impeachment inquiry that  violated all notions of due process and fundamental fairness. Then  incredibly--incredibly--when these articles were finally brought to  this Chamber without a single Republican vote, the managers then  claimed that now--now--they needed more process; that now they needed  more witnesses; that all of the witnesses that they compiled and all of  the testimony that you heard was not enough; that your job was to do  their job--the one, frankly, they failed to do.  We have already said, many times, the charges themselves do not  allege a crime or a misdemeanor, let alone a high crime or a  misdemeanor. There is nothing in the charges that could permit the  removal of a duly elected President or warrant the negation of an  election and the subversion of the American people's will. That should  be whatever party you are affiliated with. You are being asked to do  this when, tonight, the citizens of Iowa are going to be caucusing for  the first caucus of the Presidential election season for the Democratic  Party--tonight.  I think there is one thing that is clear. The President has had a  concern about other countries' carrying their fair share of burden of  financial aid. No one can doubt--and I think we have clearly set  forth--the issue of corruption in Ukraine.  The President's and the administration's policy on evaluating foreign  aid and the conditions upon which it is given have been clear. Mr.  Purpura laid that out in great detail.  The bottom line is that the President's opponents don't like the  President, and they really don't like his policies. They objected to  the fact that the President chose not to rely each and every time on  the advice of some of his subordinates, even though he, not those  unelected bureaucrats who work for him, were elected to office.  The President, under our constitutional structure, is the one who  decides our Nation's foreign policy. Here is a perfect example--the  House managers brought this up frequently: Lieutenant Colonel Vindman.  He admitted on page 155 of his transcript testimony that he ``did not  know if there was a crime or anything of that nature''--that is his  quote--but that he ``had deep policy concerns.'' So there you have it.  The real issue is policy disputes.  Elections have consequences. We all know that. And if you do not like  the policies of a particular administration or a particular candidate,  you are free and welcome to vote for another candidate. But the answer  is elections, not impeachment.  To be clear, in our country, in the United States, the President,  elected by the American people, is, in the words of the Supreme Court,  ``the sole organ of the federal government in the field of  international relations'' and foreign policy for our government--no  unelected bureaucrats, not unhappy Members of the House of  Representatives. And however you were to define ``high crimes and  misdemeanors,'' there is no definition that includes disagreeing with a  policy decision as an acceptable ground for removal of a President of  the United States. None.  The first Article of Impeachment is, therefore, constitutionally  invalid and should be immediately rejected by the Senate.  Now, as to the second Article of Impeachment, President Trump in no  way obstructed Congress. The President acted with extraordinary  transparency by declassifying and releasing the transcript for the July  25 call and the earlier call. It is that July 25 call which is  purportedly at the heart of the Articles of Impeachment. He did so soon  after the inquiry was announced.  And despite the fact that privileges apply that could have been  asserted, he released them anyway in order to facilitate the House's  inquiry and cut through all of it--all of the hearsay, all of the  histrionics--to get the transcript out.  Now, I want to take a moment because my colleague Deputy White House  Counsel Pat Philbin addressed this idea of privilege. I have heard over  and over again--and you have, too--phrases like: coverup; that the  assertion of a privilege is a coverup.  Here is what the Supreme Court of the United States has said about  privileges in a variety of contexts:  To punish a person because he has done what the law allows   him to do is a due process violation of the [basic order]--  the . . . basic sort, and for an agent of the state to pursue   a course of action whose objective is to penalize a person's   reliance on his constitutional rights is patently   unconstitutional.  And how much more so when you are talking about the President of the  United States.  How about this? And this goes to the context of assertions of  privilege and other constitutional privileges. The allegation has been  that if you assert a privilege, you are assumed to be guilty. That has  been the assertion.  Why would you do that? We have explained at great length--and I do  not want to go over that again--the importance of the executive  privilege and what it means to separation of powers and the functioning  of our government, but I will say this: As the Supreme Court has  recognized in other contexts with other privileges, the privilege  serves to protect the innocent who otherwise might be ensnared by  ambiguous circumstances.  In another Supreme Court case, Quinn v. The United States: ``The  privilege, this Court has stated, was generally regarded then, as now,  as a privilege of great value, a protection to the innocent . . . ''  The opinion goes on to say that ``safeguard against heedless, unfounded  or tyrannical prosecutions.''  I traced for you, and I am not going to do it again, how all of this  started all those years ago, 3 years ago--how all of this began. There  is no point to go over that because that evidence is undisputed, and  the FISA Court's most recent orders put that into fair play.  We have talked about the fact that the House violated its own  fundamental rules in a series of unlawful subpoenas. I won't go over  that again. Mr. Philbin laid that out in great detail.  But I do think it is important to note that, when seeking the advice  of the President's closest advisers, despite the well-known, bipartisan  guidance from the Department of Justice regarding immunity, the House  managers act as if it does not exist. They sought testimony on matters  from the executive branch's confidential, internal decision-making  process on matters of foreign relations and national security, and that  is when protections are at their highest level. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S784\">Page S784</a>, ]  Let's not forget that the House barred the attendance of executive  branch counsel at witness proceedings when executive branch members  were being examined.  Notwithstanding these substantial abuses of process, the executive  branch responded to each and every subpoena and identified the specific  deficiencies found in each. You cannot just remove constitutional  violations by saying you didn't comply.  You have heard that one recipient of a subpoena, and this is--in  fact, we have talked about it a number of times, but I think as we wrap  up, I think it is worth saying again.  One subpoena recipient did seek a declaratory judgment as to the  validity of the subpoena that he had received. It was set up to go to  court. A judge was going to make a decision. The House withdrew the  subpoena and mooted the recipient's case before the court could rule.  Now, was that because they didn't like the judge that was selected?  Was it because they didn't like the way the ruling was going to go? Was  it they didn't mean to have that witness in the first place?  Whatever the reason, there is one undisputed fact: As the case was in  court, they mooted it out by removing the subpoena.  The assertion of valid constitutional privileges cannot be an  impeachable offense, and that is what article II is based on, the  obstruction of Congress.  For the sake of the Constitution, for the sake of the Office of the  President, this body must stand as a steady bulwark against this  reckless and dangerous proposition. It doesn't just affect this  President; it affects every man or woman who occupies that high office.  So as we said with the first Article of Impeachment, we believe the  second Article of Impeachment is invalid and should also be rejected.  In passing the first Article of Impeachment, the House attempted to  usurp the President's constitutional power to determine policy,  especially foreign policy.  In passing the second Article of Impeachment, the House attempted to  control the constitutional privileges and immunities of the executive  branch--all of this while simultaneously disrespecting the Framers'  system of checks and balances, which designate the judicial branch as  the arbiter of interbranch disputes.  By approving both articles, the House of Representatives violated our  constitutional order, illegally abused our power of impeachment in  order to obstruct the President's ability to faithfully execute the  duties of his office.  These articles fail on their face as they do not meet the  constitutional standard for impeachable offenses. No amount of  testimony could change that fact.  We have already discussed some of the specifics. I think Alexander  Hamilton has been quoted a lot, and there is a reason. What has  occurred over the past 2 weeks--really, the past 3 months--is exactly  what Alexander Hamilton and other Founders of our great country feared.  I believe that Hamilton was prophetic in Federalist 65 when he warned  how impeachment had the ability to ``agitate''--his words--``the  passions of the whole community, and . . . divide it into parties more  or less friendly or inimical to the accused.  He warned that impeachment would ``connect itself with the pre- existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities, partialities,  influence, and interest on one side or on the other.''  He continued:  The convention, it appears, thought the Senate--  This body--  [the] most fit depositary of this important trust. Those who   can best discern the intrinsic difficulty of the thing, will   be least hasty in condemning that opinion, and will be most   inclined to allow due weight to the arguments which may be   supposed to have produced it.  In the same Federalist 65, Hamilton regarded the Members of this  Senate not only as the inquisitors for the Nation but as the  representatives of the Nation as a whole.  He said these words:  Where else than in the Senate could have been found a   tribunal sufficiently dignified or significantly independent?   What other body would be likely to feel confident enough in   its own situation to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the   necessary impartiality between an individual accused, and the   representatives of the people, his accusers.  You took an oath. They questioned the oath. You are sitting here as  the trier of fact. They said the Senate is on trial.  Based on all of the presentations that we made in our trial brief, in  the arguments that we have put forward today, again, we believe both  articles should be immediately rejected.  Now, our Nation's representatives holding office in this great body  must unite today to protect our Constitution and the separation of  powers. And, you know, there was a time, not that long ago, even within  this administration, where bipartisan agreements could be reached to  serve the interests of the American people.  Take a listen to this.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Senator MARKEY. Today we had a beautiful, bipartisan moment   where Democrats and Republicans, working together, to keep   that fentanyl out of our country, to use these devices to   accomplish that goal. It is not perfect. We need to do a lot   more, but today was a very good start, and I want to praise   all of the people--Democrats and Republicans and the   President--for working together on this bill.  Senator SHAHEEN. As has been said, and we can see by the   people assembled here, if we work together in a bipartisan   way, we can get things done. This is a place where we can all   agree that we've got to do more and where we can work   together. So I applaud everyone's efforts.  President TRUMP. We are proudly joined today by so many   Members of Congress--Republicans, Democrats--who worked very,   very hard on this bill. This was really an effort of   everybody. It was a bipartisan success--something you don't   hear too much about, but I think you will be. I actually   believe we may be--will be over the coming period of time. I   hope so. I think so. It is so good for the country.  President TRUMP. Thank you, everybody. This was an   incredible bipartisan support. We passed this in the Senate   87 to 12. That's unheard of. And then in the House we passed   it 358 to 36.  Senator COONS. . . . be here to help celebrate your signing   of this next step in the critical Women's Global and   Prosperity Development Initiative. It dovetails nicely with   the bill--the bipartisan bill you signed into law with the   WEEE Act, which recognizes this as a critical strategy. So I   think this is a tremendous initiative. Thank you, Mr. Trump.  President TRUMP. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.  Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. This is what the American people expect.  I simply ask this body to stand firm today to protect the integrity  of the U.S. Senate, stand firm today to protect the Office of the  President, stand firm today to protect the Constitution, stand firm  today to protect the will of the American people and their vote, stand  firm today to protect our Nation.  And I ask that this partisan impeachment come to an end to restore  our constitutional balance, for that is, in my view and in our view,  what justice demands and the Constitution requires.  With that, Mr. Chief Justice, I yield my time to the White House  Counsel, Mr. Pat Cipollone.  Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you,  Members of the Senate.  I will leave you with just a few brief points:  First, I want to express on behalf of our entire team our gratitude-- our gratitude to you, Mr. Chief Justice, for presiding over this trial;  our gratitude to you, Leader McConnell; our gratitude to you,  Democratic Leader Schumer; and all of you on both sides of the aisle  for your time and attention.  I also want to express my gratitude to our team. It is large, and  with the large number of people who have helped in this effort--I won't  name them all--but I want to thank them for their effort and their hard  work in the defense of the Constitution, in defense of the President,  in defense of the American people's right to vote. I want to thank, as  Members of that team, the Republican Members of the House of  Representatives who have also been engaged in that effort throughout  this entire period of time and the Democrats in the House who voted  against this partisan impeachment. I also want to thank the President  of the United States for his confidence in us to send us here to  represent him to all of you in this great body and for all he has done  on behalf of the American people.  I would make just a couple of additional points. No. 1, as we have  said repeatedly, we have never been in a situation like this in our  history. We have [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S785\">Page S785</a>, ] an impeachment that is purely partisan and political. It is opposed by  bipartisan Members of the House. It does not even allege a violation of  law. It is passed in an election year, and we are sitting here on the  day that election season begins in Iowa. It is wrong. There is only one  answer to that, and the answer is to reject those Articles of  Impeachment, to have confidence in the American people, to have  confidence in the result of the upcoming election, to have confidence  and respect for the last election and not throw it out and to leave the  choice of the President to the American people and to leave to them  also the accountability to the Members of the House of Representatives  who did that. That is what the Constitution requires, and I think that  should be done on a bipartisan basis, and that is what I ask you to do.  Point No. 2: I believe the American people are tired of the endless  investigations and false investigations that have been coming out of  the House from the beginning, as my colleague Mr. Sekulow pointed out.  It is a waste of tax dollars. It is a waste of the American people's  time and, I would argue, more importantly--most importantly--the  opportunity cost of that--the opportunity cost of that--what you could  be doing, what the House could be doing. Working with the President to  achieve those things on behalf of the American people is far more  important than the endless investigations, the endless false attacks,  the besmirching of the names of good people. This is something we  should reject together, and we should move forward in a bipartisan  fashion and in a way that this President has done successfully.  He has achieved successful results in the economy and across so many  other areas, working with you on both sides of the aisle, and he wants  to continue to do that. That is what I believe the American people want  those of you elected to come here to Washington to focus on, to spend  your time on--to unify us, as opposed to the bitter division that is  caused by these types of proceedings.  So at the end of the day, we put our faith in the Senate. We put our  faith in the Senate because we know you will put your faith in the  American people. You will leave this choice to them, where it belongs.  We believe that they should choose the President. We believe that this  President, day after day, has put their interests first, has achieved  successful results, has fulfilled the promises he made to them, and he  is eager to go before the American people in this upcoming election.  At the end of the day, that is the only result; it is a result, I  believe, guided by your wise words from the past that we can, together,  end the era of impeachment; that we can, together, put faith in the  American people, put faith in their wisdom, put faith in their  judgment. That is where our Founders put the power. That is where it  belongs.  I urge you, on behalf of those Americans--of every American--on  behalf of all of your constituents, to reject these Articles of  Impeachment. It is the right thing for our country. The President has  done nothing wrong, and these types of impeachments must end.  You will vindicate the right to vote, you will vindicate the  Constitution, you will vindicate the rule of law by rejecting these  articles. I ask you to do that on a bipartisan basis this week and end  the era of impeachment once and for all.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart for listening to us, for your  attention, and for considering our case on behalf of the President.  I come here today to ask you to reject these Articles of Impeachment.  Reject these Articles of Impeachment.  Thank you for granting us the permission to appear here at the Senate  on behalf of this President, and I ask you on his behalf, on behalf of  the American people to reject these articles.  Thank you.  Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, it is a problem  that here at the end of the trial the President's lawyers still dispute  the meaning of high crimes and misdemeanors. Some say it requires an  ordinary crime or that if the President misbehaves when he thinks it is  good for the country, it is OK. Neither is correct. We need to clear  this up by looking at what the Founders said.  When the Founders created the Presidency, they gave the President  great power. They had just been through a war to get rid of a King with  too much power, and they needed a check on the great power given to the  President. It was late in the Constitutional Convention that they  turned to the impeachment clause. Madison argued in favor of  impeachment. He said it was indispensable.  Mason asked:  Shall any man be above Justice? Above all shall that man be   above it, who can commit the most extensive injustice?  Randolph defended ``the propriety of impeachments,'' saying: ``The  Executive will have great opportunitys of abusing his power.''  The initial draft of the Constitution provided for impeachment only  for treason or bribery. Mason asked:  Why is the provision restrained to Treason & bribery only?   Treason as defined in the Constitution will not reach many   great and dangerous offences.  And he added:  Hastings is not guilty of Treason. Attempts to subvert the   Constitution may not be Treason as . . . defined.  Now Hastings' impeachment in Britain at this time was well known, and  it wasn't limited to a crime.  They considered adding the word ``maladministration'' to capture  abuse of Presidential power, but Madison objected. He said: ``So a  vague a term would be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the  Senate.'' So maladministration was withdrawn and replaced with the more  certain term ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' because the Founders knew  the law.  Blackstone's Commentary, which Madison said was ``a book in every  man's hand,'' described high crimes and misdemeanors as offenses  against King and government.  Hamilton called high crimes and misdemeanors ``those offenses which  proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the  abuse or violation of some public trust.''  During ratification, Randolph in Virginia cited the President's  receipt of presents or emoluments from a foreign power as an example.  And Mason's example was a President who may ``pardon crimes which were  advised by himself,'' or before indictment or conviction to ``stop  inquiry and prevent detection.'' It is clear. They knew what they  wrote.  The President's lawyers tried to create a muddle to confuse you.  Don't let them. High crimes and misdemeanors mean abuse of power  against the constitutional order, conduct that is corrupt, whether or  not a crime.  Now some say: No impeachment when there is an election coming. But  without term limits when they wrote the Constitution, there was always  an election coming. If impeachment in election years was not to be, our  Founders would have said so.  So here we are: Congress passed a law to fund Ukraine to fight the  Russians who invaded their country. President Trump illegally held that  funding up to coerce Ukraine to announce an investigation to hurt his  strongest election opponent. He abused his power corruptly to benefit  himself personally, and then he tried to cover it up. That is  impeachable.  The facts are clear, and so is the Constitution. The only question is  what you, the Senate, will do.  Our Founders created a government where the tension between the three  branches would prevent authoritarianism; no one of the branches would  be allowed to grab all the power. Impeachment was to make sure that the  President, who has the greatest opportunity to grab power, would be  held in check. It is a blunt instrument, but it is what our Founders  gave us.  Some of the Founders thought the mere existence of an impeachment  clause would prevent misconduct by Presidents, but, sadly, they were  wrong because twice in the last half century a President tried to  corruptly use his power to cheat in an election--first, Nixon with  Watergate, and now another President corruptly abuses his power to  cheat in an election.  The Founders worried about factions--what we call political parties.  They built a system where each branch of government would jealously  guard their power, not one where guarding a faction was more important  than guarding the government. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S786\">Page S786</a>, ]  Opposing a President of your own party isn't easy. It wasn't easy  when Republican Caldwell Butler voted to impeach Nixon in the Judiciary  Committee. It wasn't easy for Senator Barry Goldwater to tell Nixon to  resign. But your oath is not to do the easy thing; it is to do  impartial justice. It requires conviction and removal of President  Trump.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Chief Justice, counsel for the  President, Senators, since I was a little girl and started going to  church, I have been inspired by the words of scripture: ``[W]hatever  you did for one of the least of my brothers . . . you did for me.''  We are called to always look out for the most vulnerable. Sometimes  fighting for the most vulnerable means holding the most powerful  accountable, and that is what we are here to do today.  The American people will have to live with the decisions made in this  Chamber. In fact, Senators, I believe that the decision in this case  will affect the strength of democracies around the world.  Democracy is a gift that each generation gives to the next one. If we  say that this President can put his own interests above all else, even  when lives are at stake, then we give our Nation's children a weaker  democracy than we inherited from those that came before us. The next  generation deserves better. They are counting on us.  I am a Catholic, and my faith teaches me that we all need  forgiveness. I have given this President the benefit of the doubt from  the beginning. Despite my strong opposition to so many of his policies,  I know that the success of our Nation depends on the success of our  leader. But he has let us down.  Senators, we know what the President did and why he did it. This fact  is seriously not in doubt. Senators on both sides of the aisle have  said as much. The question for you now is, does it warrant removal from  office? We say yes.  We cannot simply hope that this President will realize that he has  done wrong or was inappropriate and hope that he does better. We have  done that so many other times. We know that he has not apologized. He  has not offered to change. We all know that he will do it again.  What President Trump did this time pierces the heart of who we are as  a country. We must stop him from further harming our democracy. We must  stop him from further betraying his oath. We must stop him from tearing  up our Constitution.  The Founders knew that in order for our Republic to survive, we would  need to be able to remove some of our leaders from office when they put  their interests above the country's interests. Senators, we have proven  that. This President committed what is called the ABC's of impeachable  behavior--abusing his power, betraying the Nation, and corrupting our  elections. He deserves to be removed for taking the very actions that  the Framers feared would undermine our country. The Framers designed  impeachment for this very case.  Senators, when I was growing up poor in South Texas, picking cotton,  I confess I didn't spend any time thinking about the Framers. Like me,  little girls and boys across America aren't asking at home what the  Framers meant by high crimes and misdemeanors, but, someday, they will  ask why we didn't do anything to stop this President, who put his own  interest above what was good for all of us. They will ask. They will  want to understand.  Senators, we inherited a democracy. Now we must protect it and pass  it on to the next generation. We simply can't give our children a  democracy if a President is above the law, because in this country no  one is above the law--not me, not any of you, not even this President.  (English translation of statement made in Spanish is as follows:)  Nobody is above the law--nobody.  This President must be removed. With that, I yield to my colleague  Mr. Crow.  Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, 2 weeks  ago we started this trial promising to show you that the President  withheld $391 million of foreign military aid to force an ally at war  to help him win the 2020 election. And by many of your own admissions,  we succeeded in showing you that, because the facts still matter.  We also promised you that, eventually, all of the facts would come  out, and that continues to be true. But we didn't just show you that  the President abused his power and obstructed Congress. We painted a  broader picture of President Trump--a picture of a man who thinks that  the Constitution doesn't serve as a check on his power, but, rather,  gives it to him in an unlimited way; a man who believes that his  personal ambitions are synonymous with the good of the country; a man  who, in his own words, thinks that if you are a star, they will let you  do anything. In short, it is a picture of a man who will always put his  own personal interests above the interests of the country that he has  sworn to protect.  But what is in an oath, anyway? Are they relics of the past? Do we  simply recite them out of custom? To me, an oath represents a firm  commitment to a life of service, a commitment to set aside your  personal interest, your comfort, and your ambition to serve the greater  good, and a commitment to sacrifice.  I explained to you last week that I believe America is great not  because of the ambition of any one man, not simply because we say it is  true but because of our almost 250-year history. Millions of Americans  have taken the oath, and they meant it. Many of them followed through  on that oath by giving everything to keep it.  But there is more to it than simply keeping your word, because an  oath is also a bond between people who have made a common promise.  Perhaps the strongest example is the promise between the Commander in  Chief and our men and women in uniform. Those men and women took their  oath with the understanding that the Commander in Chief, our President,  will always put the interests of the country and their interests above  his own, and understanding that his orders will be in the best interest  of the country, and that their sacrifice in fulfilling those orders  will always serve the common good.  But what we have clearly shown in the last few weeks and what  President Trump has shown us the past few years is that this promise  flows only one way. As Maya Angelou said, ``When someone shows you who  they are, believe them the first time.''  Many of us in this room are parents. We all try to teach our kids the  important lessons of life. One of those lessons is that you won't  always be the strongest, you won't always be the fastest, and you won't  always win. There are a lot of things outside our control, but my wife  and I have tried to teach our kids that what we can always control are  our choices.  It is in that spirit that hanging in my son's room is a quote from  Harry Potter. The quote is from Professor Dumbledore, who said: ``It is  our choices . . . that show what we truly are, far more than our  abilities.''  This trial will soon be over, but there will be many choices for all  of us in the days ahead, the most pressing of which is how each of us  will decide to fulfill our oath. More than our words, our choices will  show the world who we really are, what type of leaders we will be, and  what type of Nation we will be.  So let me finish where I began, with an explanation of why I am here  standing before you. I have been carrying my kids' Constitutions these  last few weeks, and this morning I wrote a note to them to explain why  I am here:  Our Founders recognized the failings of all people. So they   designed a system to ensure that the ideas and principles   contained in this document would always be greater than any   one person. It is the idea that no one is above the law. But   our system only works if people stand up and fight for it,   and fighting for something important always comes with a   cost.  Some day you may be called upon to defend the principles   and ideas embodied in our Constitution. May the memory and   spirit of those who sacrificed for them in the past guide you   and give you strength as you fight for them in the future.  Thank you for your time.  Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, and counsel for  the President, this is a defining moment in our history and a  challenging time for our Nation. A thousand things have gone through my  mind since this body voted to not call witnesses in this trial. The  vote was unprecedented. The [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S787\">Page S787</a>, ] President's former National Security Advisor indicated that he was  willing to testify under oath before the Senate. Yet this body did not  want to hear what he had to say.  The President's lawyers have asked you to not believe your lying eyes  and ears, to reinterpret the Constitution, and to believe that if the  President thinks his reelection is in our national interest, then he  can do whatever he wants--anything--to make it happen. And that is  exactly what he was attempting to do--anything--when he illegally held  much needed military aid while pressuring Ukraine's President to  announce bogus investigations into his most feared political rival.  This trial is about abuse of power, obstruction, breaking the law,  and our system of checks and balances, and since we are talking about  the President of the United States, this trial is also most certainly  about character.  I am reminded today, Senators, of my own father. He worked more than  one job. He didn't have a famous last name. His name appeared on no  building, but my father was rich in something no money and, apparently,  no powerful position can buy. You see, my father was a man who was  decent, honest, a man of integrity, and he was a man of good, moral  character. The President's lawyer never spoke about the President's  character during this trial, and I find that quite telling.  I joined the police department because I wanted to make a difference,  and I believe I did. As a police chief, I was always concerned about  the message we were sending inside the agency, especially to young  recruits, especially to newly hired dedicated police officers. We had  to be careful about just how we were defining what was acceptable and  unacceptable behavior inside the department and out in the community.  Yes, people make mistakes. Yes, individuals make mistakes. But we had  to be clear about the culture inside the organization, and we had to  send a strong message that the police department was not a place where  corruption could reside, where corruption was normalized, and where  corruption was covered up.  Today, unfortunately, I believe we are holding young police recruits  to a higher standard than we are the leader of the free world. If this  body fails to hold this President accountable, you must ask yourselves:  What kind of Republic will we ultimately have with a President who  thinks that he can really truly do whatever he wants? You will send a  terrible message to the Nation that one can get away with abuse of  power, obstruction, cheating, and spreading false narratives if you  simply know the right people.  Well, today, Senators, I reject that because we are a nation of laws.  Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States said this:  ``America will never be destroyed from outside. If we falter and lose  our freedoms, it will be because we chose to destroy ourselves.''  I urge you, Senators, to vote to convict and remove this President.  Thank you so much for your time.  Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished Members of the  Senate, President's counsel, I mentioned on the floor last week that  Alexander Hamilton has played a starring role during this impeachment  trial. But Ben Franklin has only made a cameo appearance, but that  cameo appearance was an important one, when he made the observation, in  the aftermath of that convention in 1787, that the Framers of the  Constitution had created ``a Republic, if you can keep it.''  Why would Dr. Franklin express ambiguity about the future of America  during such a triumphant moment? Perhaps it was because the system of  government that was created at that convention--checks and balances,  separate and coequal branches of government, the independent judiciary,  the free and fair press, the preeminence of the rule of law--all of  those values, all of those ideas, all of those institutions have never  before been put together in one form of government. So perhaps it was  uncertain as to whether America could sustain them.  But part of the brilliance of our great country is that year after  year, decade after decade, century after century, we have held this  democracy thing together. But now all of those ideas, all of those  values, all of those institutions are under assault, not from without  but from within. We created ``a Republic, if you can keep it.''  House managers have proven our case against President Trump with a  mountain of evidence. President Trump tried to cheat, he got caught,  and then he worked hard to cover it up.  President Trump corruptly abused his power. President Trump  obstructed a congressionally and constitutionally required impeachment  inquiry with blanket defiance. President Trump solicited foreign  interference in an American election and shredded the very fabric of  our democracy. House managers have proven our case against President  Trump with a mountain of evidence.  If the Senate chooses to acquit under these circumstances, then  America is in the wilderness.  If the Senate chooses to normalize lawlessness, if the Senate chooses  to normalize corruption, if the Senate chooses to normalize  Presidential abuse of power, then America is in the wilderness.  If the Senate chooses to acquit President Trump without issuing a  single subpoena, without interviewing a single witness, without  reviewing a single new document, then America is truly in the  wilderness.  But all is not lost. Even at this late hour, the Senate can still do  the right thing. America is watching. The world is watching. The eyes  of history are watching. The Senate can still do the right thing.  Scripture says--Second Corinthians, the fifth chapter and the seventh  verse, encourages us to walk by faith, not by sight. Faith is the  substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. We have  come this far by faith.  And so I say to all of you, my fellow Americans, walk by faith.  Democrats and Republicans, progressives and conservatives, the left and  the right, all points in between, walk by faith. There are patriots all  throughout the Chamber, patriots who can be found all throughout the  land--in urban America, rural America, suburban America, smalltown  America. Walk by faith. Through the ups and the downs, the highs and  the lows, the peaks and the valleys, the trials and the tribulations of  this turbulent moment, walk by faith--faith in the Constitution; faith  in our democracy; faith in the rule of law; faith in government of the  people, by the people, and for the people; faith in almighty God. Walk  by faith.  The Senate can still do the right thing. And if we come together as  Americans, then together we can eradicate the cancer that threatens our  democracy and continue our long, necessary, and majestic march toward a  more perfect union.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, I want to begin by thanking  you for the distinguished way you have presided over these proceedings.  Senators, we are not enemies but friends. We must not be enemies. If  Lincoln could speak these words during the Civil War, surely we can  live them now and overcome our divisions and our animosities.  It is midnight in Washington. The lights are finally going out in the  Capitol after a long day in the impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump.  The Senate heard arguments only hours earlier on whether to call  witnesses and require the administration to release documents it has  withheld. Counsel for the President still maintains the President's  innocence, while opposing any additional evidence that would prove  otherwise.  It is midnight in Washington, but on this night, not all the lights  have been extinguished. Somewhere in the bowels of the Justice  Department--Donald Trump's Justice Department--a light remains on.  Someone has waited until the country is asleep to hit ``Send,'' to  inform the court in a filing due that day that the Justice Department-- the Department that would represent justice--is refusing to produce  documents directly bearing on the President's decision to withhold  military aid from Ukraine. The Trump administration has them, it is not  turning them over, and it does not want the Senate to know until it is  too late. Send.  That is what happened last Friday night. When you left home for the  weekend, in a replay of the duplicity we saw during the trial when the  President's lawyers argued here that the House must go to court and  argued in court that the House must come here, [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S788\">Page S788</a>, ] they were at it again, telling the court in a midnight filing that they  would not turn over relevant documents even as they argued here that  they were not covering up the President's misdeeds.  Midnight in Washington. All too tragic. A metaphor for where the  country finds itself at the conclusion of only the third impeachment in  history and the first impeachment trial without witnesses or documents,  the first such trial--or nontrial--in impeachment history.  How did we get here? In the beginning of this proceeding, you did not  know whether we could prove our case. Many Senators, like many  Americans, did not have the opportunity to watch much, let alone all,  of the opening hearings in the House during our investigation, and none  of us could anticipate what defenses the President might offer.  Now you have seen what we promised: overwhelming evidence of the  President's guilt. Donald John Trump withheld hundreds of millions of  dollars from an ally at war and a coveted White House meeting with  their President to coerce or extort that nation's help to cheat in our  elections. And when he was found out, he engaged in the most  comprehensive effort to cover up his misconduct in the history of  Presidential impeachment: fighting all subpoenas for documents and  witnesses and using his own obstruction as a sword and a shield;  arguing here that the House did not fight hard enough to overcome their  noninvocation of privilege in court, and in court that the House must  not be heard to enforce their subpoenas but that impeachment is a  proper remedy.  Having failed to persuade the Senate or the public that there was no  quid pro quo, having offered no evidence to contradict the record, the  President's team opted, in a kind of desperation, for a different kind  of defense: first, prevent the Senate and the public from hearing from  witnesses with the most damning accounts of the President's misconduct,  and second, fall back on a theory of Presidential power so broad and  unaccountable that it would allow any occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania to  be as corrupt as he chooses, while the Congress is powerless to do  anything about it. That defense collapsed of its own dead weight.  Presidents may abuse their power with impunity, they argued. Abuse of  power is not a constitutional crime, they claimed. Only statutory crime  is a constitutional crime, even though there were no statutory crimes  when the Constitution was adopted. The President had to look far and  wide to find a defense lawyer to make such an argument, unsupported by  history, the Founders, or common sense. The Republican expert witness  in the House would not make it. Serious constitutional scholars would  not make it. Even Alan Dershowitz would not make it--at least he  wouldn't in 1998. But this has become the President's defense. Yet this  defense proved indefensible.  If abuse of power is not impeachable--even though it is clear the  Founders considered it the highest of all high crimes and  misdemeanors--but if it is not impeachable, then a whole range of  utterly unacceptable conduct of the President's would now be beyond  reach. Trump could offer Alaska to the Russians in exchange for support  in the next election or decide to move to Mar-a-Lago permanently and  let Jared Kushner run the country, delegating to him the decision  whether to go to war. Because those things are not necessarily  criminal, this argument would allow that he could not be impeached for  such abuses of power.  Of course, this would be absurd--more than absurd, it would be  dangerous. So Mr. Dershowitz tried to embellish his legal creation and  distinguish among those abuses of power which would be impeachable from  those which wouldn't. Abuses of power that would help the President get  elected were permissible and therefore unimpeachable, and only those  for pecuniary gain were beyond the pale. Under this theory, as long as  the President believed his reelection was in the public interest, he  could do anything, and no quid pro quo was too corrupt, no damage to  our national security too great. This was such an extreme view that  even the President's other lawyers had to run away from it.  So what are we left with? The House has proven the President's guilt.  He tried to coerce an ally into helping him cheat by smearing his  opponent. He betrayed our national security in order to do it when he  withheld military aid to our ally and violated the law to do so. He  covered it up, and he covers it up still. His continuing obstruction is  a threat to the oversight and investigatory powers of the House and  Senate and, if left unaddressed, would permanently and dangerously  alter the balance of power.  These undeniable facts require the President to retreat to his final  defense. He is guilty as sin, but can't we just let the voters decide?  He is guilty as sin, but why not let the voters clean up this mess? And  here, to answer that question, we must look at the history of this  Presidency and to the character of this President--or lack of  character--and ask, can we be confident that he will not continue to  try to cheat in that very election? Can we be confident that Americans  and not foreign powers will get to decide and that the President will  shun any further foreign interference in our democratic affairs? And  the short, plain, sad, incontestable answer is, no, you can't. You  can't trust this President to do the right thing, not for one minute,  not for one election, not for the sake of our country. You just can't.  He will not change, and you know it.  In 2016, he invited foreign interference in our election. Hey,  Russia, if you are listening, hack Hillary's emails, he said, and they  did, immediately. And when the Russians starting dumping them before  the election, he made use of them in every conceivable way, touting the  filthy lucre at campaign stops more than 100 times.  When he was investigated, he did everything he could to obstruct  justice, going so far as to fire the FBI Director and try to fire the  special counsel and ask the White House Counsel to lie on his behalf.  During the same campaign, while telling the country he had no  business dealings with Russia, he was continuing to actively pursue the  most lucrative deal of his life--a Trump Tower in the heart of Moscow.  Six close associates of the President's would be indicted or go to jail  in connection with the President's campaign, Russia, and the effort to  cover it up.  On the day after that tragic chapter appeared to come to an end with  Bob Mueller's testimony, Donald Trump was back on the phone, this time  with another foreign power--Ukraine--and once again seeking foreign  help with his election, only this time, he had the full powers of the  Presidency at his disposal. This time, he could use coercion. This  time, he could withhold aid from a nation whose soldiers were dying  every week. This time, he believed he could do whatever he wanted under  article II. And this time, when he was caught, he could make sure that  the Justice Department would never investigate the matter, and they  didn't.  Donald Trump had no more Jeff Sessions; he had just the man he wanted  in Bill Barr, a man whose view of the imperial Presidency--a Presidency  in which the Department of Justice is little more than an extension of  the White House Counsel--is to do the President's bidding. So Congress  had to do the investigation itself, and just as before, he obstructed  that investigation in every way.  He has not changed. He will not change. He has made that clear  himself without self-awareness or hesitation. A man without character  or ethical compass will never find his way.  Even as the most recent and most egregious misconduct was discovered,  he was unapologetic, unrepentant, and more dangerous, undeterred. He  continued pressing Ukraine to smear his rivals even as the  investigation was underway.  He invited new countries to get involved in the act, calling on China  to do the same. His personal emissary, Rudy Giuliani, dispatched  himself to Ukraine, trying to get further foreign interference in our  election. The plot goes on; the scheming persists; and the danger will  never recede. He has done it before. He will do it again. What are the  odds, if left in office, that he will continue trying to cheat? I will  tell you: 100 percent. Not 5, not 10 or even 50, but 100 percent.  If you have found him guilty and you do not remove him from office,  he will continue trying to cheat in the election until he succeeds.  Then what shall [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S789\">Page S789</a>, ] you say? What shall you say if Russia again interferes in our election  and Donald Trump does nothing but celebrates their efforts? What shall  you say if Ukraine capitulates and announces investigations into the  President's rivals?  What shall you say in the future, when candidates compete for the  allegiance of foreign powers in their elections, when they draft their  platforms so to encourage foreign intervention in their campaign?  Foreign nations, as the most super of super-PACs of them all, if not  legal, somehow permissible because Donald Trump has made it so and we  refused to do anything about it but wring our hands.  They will hack your opponents' emails; they will mount a social media  campaign to support you; they will announce investigations of your  opponent to help you--and all for the asking. Leave Donald Trump in  office after you have found him guilty, and this is the future that you  will invite.  Now, we have known since the day we brought these charges that the  bar to conviction, requiring fully two-thirds of the Senate, may be  prohibitively high. And yet, the alternative is a runaway Presidency  and a nation whose elections are open to the highest bidder.  So you might ask how--given the gravity of the President's  misconduct, given the abundance of evidence of his guilt, given the  acknowledgement by Senators in both parties of that guilt--how have we  arrived here with so little common ground? Why was the Nixon  impeachment bipartisan? Why was the Clinton impeachment much less so?  And why is the gulf between the parties even greater today?  It is not for the reason that the President's lawyers would have you  believe. Although they have claimed many times, in many ways, that the  process in the House was flawed because we did not allow the President  to control it, it was, in reality, little different than the process in  prior impeachments. The circumstances, of course, were different. The  Watergate investigation began in the Senate and had progressed before  it got moving in the House. And there, of course, much of the  investigative work had been done by the special prosecutor, Leon  Jaworski. In Clinton, there was likewise an independent counsel who  conducted a multiyear investigation that started with a real estate  deal in Arkansas and ended with a blue dress.  Nixon and Clinton, of course, played no role in those investigations  before they moved to the House Judiciary Committee. But to the degree  you can compare the process when it got to the Judiciary Committee in  either prior and recent impeachments, it was largely the same as we  have here. The President had the right to call witnesses, to ask  questions, and chose not to.  The House majorities in Nixon and Clinton did not cede their subpoena  power to their minorities, and neither did we here, although then, as  now, we gave the minority the right to request subpoenas and to compel  a vote, and they did.  So the due process the House provided here was essentially the same  and, in some ways, even greater. Nevertheless, the President's counsel  hopes that, through sheer repetition, they can convert nontruth into  truth. Do not let them.  Every single court to hear Mr. Philbin's arguments has rejected them:  The subpoenas are invalid--rejected by the McGahn court.  They have absolute immunity--rejected by the McGahn court.  Privilege may conceal crime or fraud--rejected by the court in Nixon.  But if the process here was substantially the same, the facts of the  President's misconduct were very different from one impeachment to the  next. The Republican Party of Nixon's time broke into the DNC, and the  President covered it up. Nixon, too, abused the power of his office to  gain an unfair advantage over his opponent, but in Watergate he never  sought to coerce a foreign power to aid his reelection, nor did he  sacrifice our national security in such a palpable and destructive way  as withholding aid from an ally at war. And he certainly did not engage  in the wholesale obstruction of Congress or justice that we have seen  this President commit.  The facts of President Clinton's misconduct pale in comparison to  Nixon and do not hold a candle to Donald Trump. Lying about an affair  is morally wrong, and when under oath it is a crime, but it had nothing  to do with his duties in office.  The process being the same, the facts of President Trump's misconduct  being far more destructive than either past President, what then  accounts for the disparate result in bipartisan support for his  removal? What has changed?  The short answer is, we have changed. The Members of Congress have  changed. For reasons as varied as the stars, the Members of this body  and ours in the House are now far more accepting of the most serious  misconduct of a President as long as it is a President of one's own  party. And that is a trend most dangerous for our country.  Fifty years ago, no lawyer representing the President would have ever  made the outlandish argument that if the President believes his  corruption will serve to get him reelected, whether it is by coercing  an ally to help him cheat or in any other form, that he may not be  impeached, that this is somehow a permissible use of his power.  But here we are. The argument has been made, and some appear ready to  accept it. And that is dangerous, for there is no limiting principle to  that position.  It must have come as a shock--a pleasant shock--to this President  that our norms and institutions would prove to be so weak. The  independence of the Justice Department and its formerly proud Office of  Legal Counsel now are mere legal tools at the President's disposal to  investigate enemies or churn out helpful opinions not worth the paper  they are written on. The FBI painted by a President as corrupt and  disloyal. The intelligence community not to be trusted against the good  counsel of Vladimir Putin. The press portrayed as enemies of the  people. The daily attacks on the guardrails of our democracy, so  relentlessly assailed, have made us numb and blind to the consequences.  Does none of that matter anymore if he is the President of our party?  I hope and pray that we never have a President like Donald Trump in  the Democratic Party, one who would betray the national interest and  the country's security to help with his reelection. And I would hope to  God that, if we did, we would impeach him, and Democrats would lead the  way.  But I suppose you never know just how difficult that is until you are  confronted with it. But you, my friends, are confronted with it. You  are confronted with that difficulty now, and you must not shrink from  it.  History will not be kind to Donald Trump--I think we all know that-- not because it will be written by Never Trumpers but because whenever  we have departed from the values of our Nation, we have come to regret  it, and that regret is written all over the pages of our history.  If you find that the House has proved its case and still vote to  acquit, your name will be tied to his with a chord of steel and for all  of history; but if you find the courage to stand up to him, to speak  the awful truth to his rank falsehood, your place will be among the  Davids who took on Goliath. If only you will say ``enough.''  We revere the wisdom of our Founders and the insights they had into  self-governance. We scour their words for hidden meaning and try to  place ourselves in their shoes. But we have one advantage that the  Founders did not. For all their genius, they could not see but opaquely  into the future. We, on the other hand, have the advantage of time, of  seeing how their great experiment in self-governance has progressed.  When we look at the sweep of history, there are times when our Nation  and the rest of the world have moved with a seemingly irresistible  force in the direction of greater freedom: more freedom to speak and to  assemble, to practice our faith and tolerate the faith of others, to  love whom we would and choose love over hate--more free societies,  walls tumbling down, nations reborn.  But then, like a pendulum approaching the end of its arc, the outward  movement begins to arrest. The golden globe of freedom reaches its  zenith and starts to retreat. The pendulum swings back past the center  and recedes into a dark unknown. How much farther will [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S790\">Page S790</a>, ] it travel in its illiberal direction, how many more freedoms will be  extinguished before it turns back we cannot say. But what we do here,  in this moment, will affect its course and its correction.  Every single vote, even a single vote by a single Member, can change  the course of history. It is said that a single man or a woman of  courage makes a majority. Is there one among you who will say  ``enough''?  America believes in a thing called truth. She does not believe we are  entitled to our own alternate facts. She recoils at those who spread  pernicious falsehoods. To her, truth matters. There is nothing more  corrosive to a democracy than the idea that there is no truth.  America also believes there is a difference between right and wrong,  and right matters here. But there is more. Truth matters. Right  matters. But so does decency. Decency matters.  When the President smears a patriotic public servant like Marie  Yovanovitch in pursuit of a corrupt aim, we recoil. When the President  mocks the disabled, a war hero who was a prisoner of war, or a Gold  Star father, we are appalled because decency matters here. And when the  President tries to coerce an ally to help him cheat in our elections  and then covers it up, we must say ``enough.'' Enough.  He has betrayed our national security, and he will do so again. He  has compromised our elections, and he will do so again. You will not  change him. You cannot constrain him. He is who he is. Truth matters  little to him. What is right matters even less. And decency matters not  at all.  I do not ask you to convict him because truth or right or decency  matters nothing to him but because we have proven our case and it  matters to you. Truth matters to you. Right matters to you. You are  decent. He is not who you are.  In Federalist 55, James Madison wrote that there were certain  qualities in human nature--qualities I believe, like honesty, right,  and decency--which should justify our confidence in self-government. He  believed that we possessed sufficient virtue that the chains of  despotism were not necessary to restrain ourselves ``from destroying  and devouring one another.''  It may be midnight in Washington, but the sun will rise again. I put  my faith in the optimism of the Founders. You should too. They gave us  the tools to do the job, a remedy as powerful as the evil it was meant  to constrain: impeachment. They meant it to be used rarely, but they  put it in the Constitution for a reason--for a man who would sell out  his country for a political favor, for a man who would threaten the  integrity of our elections, for a man who would invite foreign  interference in our affairs, for a man who would undermine our national  security and that of our allies--for a man like Donald J. Trump.  They gave you a remedy, and they meant for you to use it. They gave  you an oath, and they meant for you to observe it. We have proven  Donald Trump guilty. Now do impartial justice and convict him.  I yield back.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.  Adjournment of the Court of Impeachment    ", "Mr. RICHMOND": " Mr. RICHMOND. The urgency.  Speaker PELOSI. And urgent. And urgent.    ", "Mr. TAPPER": " Mr. TAPPER. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is still holding on   to the Articles of Impeachment.  Mr. Counsel HERSCHMANN. Urgency? Urgency, for which you want to  immediately remove the President of the United States? You sat on the  articles for a month--the longest delay in the history of our country.  They adopted them on Friday, December 13, 2019--Friday the 13th--went  on vacation, and finally decided after one of their Democratic  Presidential debates had finished and after the BCS football  championship game, that it was time to deliver them.  What happened to their national security interest argument? Wasn't  that the reason that they said they had to rush to vote? It is urgent,  they told us. No due process for this President. It is a crisis of  monumental proportion. Our national security is at risk every  additional day that he is in office, they tell us.  The House managers also used the same excuse for not issuing  subpoenas for testimony. They had no time for the normal judicial  review. They even complained about the judicial review process sitting  in this Chamber before the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court--a  judicial review in which the judge agreed to an expedited schedule.  Even that was not good enough for them when they issued the subpoenas.  One of the lawyers for the subpoenaed witnesses wrote to the House  general counsel: ``We are dismayed that the House committees have  chosen not to join us in seeking resolution from the judicial branch of  this momentous constitutional question as expeditiously as possible.''  He continued: ``It is important to get a definitive judgment from the  judicial branch determining their constitutional duty in the place of  conflicting demands of the legislative and executive branches.''  Isn't that the point? Isn't that how our system of government works?  Isn't that how it has always worked? Isn't that how it is supposed to  work?  These same Democrats defended other administrations who fought  judicial review of congressional subpoenas, and I think we all remember  Fast and Furious.  The same attorney, when he wrote to the House chair, said:  The House chairmen, Mr. Schiff and Mr. Nadler, are mistaken   to say the lawsuit is intended to delay or otherwise obstruct   the committees' vital investigatory work.  He continued:  Nor has this lawsuit been coordinated in any way with the   White House any more than it has been coordinated with the   House of Representatives. If the House chooses not to pursue   through subpoenaed testimony, let the record be clear that is   the House's decision, if they come before you and they blame   the administration and they blame you if you don't subpoena   witnesses and have them before you.  Yet even in the face of this overwhelming evidence, they claim that  the President is to blame for their decision to withdraw their own  subpoenas or not issue others. Their choice, but the President is  responsible. That is one of their claims. It is ludicrous.  They are blaming the President because they decided on their own not  to seek judicial review and enforcement of their own subpoenas and for  some witnesses never even issued subpoenas. In their minds, that is  impeachable.  Manager Nadler spoke eloquently back before the House Judiciary  Committee hearing in December of 1998. He said:  There must never be a narrowly voted impeachment or an   impeachment substantially supported by one of our major   political parties and largely opposed by the other. Such an   impeachment would lack legitimacy, would produce divisiveness   and bitterness in our politics for years to come, and will   call into question the very legitimacy of our political   institutions.  Manager Nadler was right then, and it is equally true today.  Divisiveness and bitterness. Divisiveness and bitterness. Listen to his  words.  Impeachments by one party cause divisiveness and bitterness in our  country. That is what a partisan impeachment leads to.  Sadly, when Manager Nadler eloquently warned against divisiveness and  bitterness, the House did not follow his admonition. They did not heed  his advice, and that is one of the reasons we are sitting here today  with Articles of Impeachment that are not found in our Constitution or  the evidence and are brought simply for partisan politics.  This is a sad time for all of us. This is not a time to give out  souvenirs, the pens used to sign two Articles of Impeachment, trying to  improperly impeach our country's representative to the world.  This is not the time to try to get digs in that the President will  always be impeached because we had the majority and we could do it to  you and we did it to you. It is wrong. It is not what the American  people deserve or want.  Sadly, the House managers do not trust their fellow Americans to  choose their own President. They do not think [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S604\">Page S604</a>, ] that they can legitimately win an election against President Trump, so  they need to rush to impeach him immediately. That is what they have  continually told the American people, and that--that is a shame.  We, on the other hand, trust our fellow Americans to choose their  President. Choose your candidate. Let the Senators who are here who are  trying to become the Democratic nominee try to win that election, and  let the American people choose.  Maybe--maybe they are concerned that the American people like  historically low unemployment. Maybe the American people like that  their 401(k) accounts have done extremely well. Maybe the American  people like prison reform and giving people a second chance.  Tellingly, some of these House managers worked constructively with  this administration to give Americans a second chance. That was the  public interest. That is what the country demands. That is what society  deserves.  Maybe the American people like an administration that is fighting the  opioid epidemic. Maybe the American people like secure borders. Maybe  the American people like better trade agreements with our biggest  trading partners. Maybe the American people like other countries  sharing in the burden when it comes to foreign aid. Maybe the American  people actually like low taxes. In other words, maybe the American  people like their current President--a President who has kept his  promises and delivered on them.  If you think Americans want to abandon our prosperity and our  unprecedented successes under this President, then convince the  electorate in November at the ballot box. Do not try to improperly  interfere with an election that is only months away, based on these  Articles of Impeachment.  In your trial memorandum that you submitted here before the Senate,  you speak about the Framers of the Constitution believing that  President Trump's alleged conduct is their ``worst nightmare'' and that  they would be horrified.  In fact, sadly, sadly, it is the House managers' conduct in bringing  these baseless Articles of Impeachment that would clearly be their and  our worst nightmare.  Thank you.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.  Recess    ", "Ms. LOFGREN": " Ms. LOFGREN. This is unfair to the American people. By   these actions you would undo the free election that expressed   the will of the American people in 1996. In so doing, you   will damage the faith the American people have in this   institution and in the American democracy. You will set the   dangerous precedent that the certainty of Presidential terms,   which has so benefited our wonderful America, will be   replaced by the partisan use of impeachment. Future   Presidents will face election, then litigation, then   impeachment. The power of the President will diminish in the   face of the Congress, a phenomena much feared by the Founding   Fathers.    ", "Ms. ROSEN": " Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and thank my dear  friend and colleague, Senator Doug Jones, for the hard and noble work  he has done in the United States Senate. I greatly admire his passion  and all that he accomplished for the people of Alabama and all  Americans.  For his entire life, Senator Jones has stood tall as a pillar of  justice and equality. After graduating law school, Senator Jones became  counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee for then-Senator Howell  Heflin and served as an Assistant United States Attorney shortly after.  Senator Jones then became the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District  of Alabama, where he fought for civil liberties and against racial  injustice. As U.S. Attorney, he successfully was able to prosecute two  of the four men who were responsible for the 1963 bombing of the 16th  Street Baptist Church, and later indicted domestic terrorist Eric  Rudolph. By pursuing these cases, Senator Jones encouraged us all to  continue to reject bigotry and hate in all its forms.  In 2017, Senator Jones became the first Democrat to represent the  state of Alabama since 1997. He made it his duty to represent the  people of Alabama in every vote he made on the Senate floor. He always  voted in the best interests of his constituents, even when it wasn't  politically expedient or convenient. His service stands as a reminder  that bipartisanship is vital in addressing the issues that our nation  currently faces.  Senator Jones is a man of bravery and strength. His heart and passion  are not only moving, but admirable as well. I am very proud to have had  Senator Jones as a friend and colleague as we served alongside each  other on the HELP Committee these past two years, and I am eager to  continue watching his fierce fight against injustice, joining with him  in this struggle until hate is rejected in every corner of this nation.  Doug, you have been a great friend and colleague of mine in the  Senate. It has been an honor serving alongside you, and I am so sorry  to see you go. We have shared so much, both on and off the Senate  floor, and I look forward to continuing our friendship. During your  time here, you've shown bravery and strength, you followed your  conscious, and you have always done what was right. The lives of the  people of Alabama have been made better with you as their Senator. You  will be dearly missed.    ", "Mr. LEE": " Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I stand today to honor my friend Gary  Herbert, Governor of the State of Utah for the last 12 years, who,  after a long career in public service, is now embarking on a really  well-deserved, hard-earned retirement.  He served the State of Utah and has done so with great enthusiasm and  dedication and spirit, and I am grateful to have worked alongside him  throughout his tenure serving our great State.  Gary Herbert was born in American Fork, UT, and grew up in Orem. He  served a 2-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints on the east coast and later attended Brigham Young University,  my alma mater.  He first began his public service in college, serving in the Utah  Army National Guard for 6 years and eventually becoming a staff  sergeant. After his time in the National Guard, he set up a real estate  firm and was very successful, eventually becoming the president of the  Utah Association of Realtors. He also served as president of the Utah  Association of Counties, by the way.  Starting in 1990, he served as a commissioner on the Utah County  Commission. He served there for 14 years, and it was at that point that  he began his statewide service within Utah. You see, in 2004, when Jon  Huntsman ran for the Governor's seat, Gary became his running mate,  running alongside Huntsman as his Lieutenant Governor, with the pair  going on to win the race in November.  It was then that I first got to know Gary Herbert personally, when I  was hired to be Governor Huntsman's general counsel. One of my first  memories of Gary Herbert--which, to me, seems like it was just the day  before yesterday--occurred when we all began moving into the Governor's  office suite, just the day before Herbert and Huntsman were sworn into  office.  Gary came in and provided us all with a warm welcome, but he didn't  stop at the welcome. He offered really sound and heartfelt advice about  the importance of staying grounded as we were entering the political  fray. He explained that long after our service and the Huntsman-Herbert  administration expired, we want to be able to look back and be pleased  about the relationships that we had formed with each other, but  especially the relationships [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7991\">Page S7991</a>, ] that we had maintained with our families, our children, and God.  I soon learned that Governor Herbert, in addition to being wise and  in addition to being a skilled and valuable statesman, was also a  formidable athlete. Right after he and Governor Huntsman were sworn in,  the staff got together as a team several times in the Governor's  mansion, where we soon discovered there was a ping-pong table in the  basement. I then learned the hard way that Governor Herbert's athletic  skills, including his ping-pong skills, are off the charts.  While severing Governor Huntsman, I always found Gary to be friendly,  approachable, and always willing to tackle every single assignment with  eagerness and poise. Whenever Governor Huntsman's schedule became  chaotic or changed unexpectedly, which happens in any Governor's office  or any Senator's office, for that matter, particularly at certain times  of the year, Lieutenant Governor Herbert would routinely be dispatched  to speak on Huntsman's behalf, often sending him to remote corners of  the State and often at really inconvenient times.  He never once complained. And he was not only willing, but he was  always eager and happy. He felt fortunate for the opportunity to help.  That is the kind of enthusiasm that the people of the State of Utah  have benefitted from for so long as a result of Gary Herbert's service.  You see, he has never lost that--not during his entire time as  Lieutenant Governor and not during his entire time as Governor. You can  tell that he is exactly where he wants to be and that he feels  privileged and he has been blessed to be able to serve the people of  Utah.  Likewise, whenever there was an issue that needed to be addressed by  the Governor, even within the office or around the capitol compound,  but where the Governor was unable to meet with the particular group in  question, Gary was always assigned to the case. He would meet with, as  he described it, all the different stakeholders. He would get together  the legislators, county commissioners, citizens from this or that part  of the State, lobbyists, lawyers who may have been involved, in  addition to other members of Governor Huntsman's administration. He  would bring them all in together, and he would wade through all the  intricate and often pedestrian details of the matter. You see, he  wanted to get to the bottom of the issue. He wanted to understand it.  What is more, he had the skill of figuring out the best path forward  for all parties involved and for making everyone feel heard and  understood. If ever, whenever, there was a way to achieve a win-win,  Gary found it, and he brought people to it, and they were always  grateful as a result.  The same traits that I saw in him as Lieutenant Governor would go on  to make him an effective and beloved Governor himself. In office now as  Governor since 2009, Gary Herbert is currently the Nation's longest  serving Governor, and our State has seen exciting achievement and  tremendous prosperity with Governor Herbert at the helm.  In the last 8 years, Utah has seen continued, steady growth in our  economy, with improvements in our GDP, number of jobs, and unemployment  rate. We have seen the boom of Silicon Slopes. We celebrated the  sesquicentennial of the driving of the Golden Spike, when it was an  honor to stand alongside Governor and Mrs. Herbert at that celebratory  reenactment.  On that particular occasion, Governor Herbert and his wife Jeanette  showed their characteristic enthusiasm by arriving in their finest 1869  apparel just to commemorate the moment, and it made all the difference.  It made it all feel much more authentic.  So, too, was it an honor to join Gary when President Trump came to  Utah to announce his decision to shrink the Bears Ears National  Monument, when we could all stand together and celebrate the fact that  someone in Washington had heard our concerns within the State and saw  fit to redraw the boundaries in a manner more compatible with local  interests and concerns.  Through his enthusiasm and his zeal, Gary Herbert has championed our  State and the things that we stand for. He has done so very  consistently and very enthusiastically. He can rattle off figures and  metrics about Utah at the drop of a hat. I am convinced this man can do  it in his sleep and do so infectiously and persuasively. And he is a  compelling spokesman for our State's values.  His spirit has helped Utah to attract talent and investment not only  from throughout the United States but from throughout the world and to  make it the good place that it is to live.  Not only that, but Gary has been an instrumental partner in  supporting initiatives that reflect and strengthen the values of our  State. To champion the reclamation of our lands, he signed into law the  Utah Transfer of Public Lands Act. He also signed into law innovative  criminal justice reforms in Utah. He was at the cutting edge of that  movement, making a far-reaching impact across our State and that ended  up having impacts elsewhere.  In fact, his work in Utah in criminal justice reform helped pave the  way for the work that Congress and President Trump were able to achieve  at the Federal level through the passage of the First Step Act.  He has been a strong supporter of Utah's family culture and was  helpful in the Senate's work promoting the child tax credit during our  tax reform discussions just 3 years ago.  On a more personal note, Gary Herbert also had the wisdom to put my  brother Tom on the Utah Supreme Court. In so doing, he has been a  champion for textualism, the notion that judges are there to interpret  the law based on what the law says, rather than on the basis of what it  might have said.  For all of his public achievements, Gary is perhaps most proud and  always most conscious of and most aware of and most concerned about his  own role as a husband, as a father, and as a grandfather. Gary and his  wife Jeanette have 6 children together, as well as 16 grandchildren,  and he is known to encourage them to ``follow in his footsteps and  marry up.''  In a myriad of ways, Governor Herbert has been a champion and a  spokesman for all that is good about our State. It has been an honor to  serve the people of Utah with him, and I wish Governor Herbert and his  wife Jeanette all the best as they embark on the next chapter of their  lives together.

Res. 806    ", "Mr. SCHATZ": " Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, today, I rise to pay tribute to MAJ  Catherine ``Catie'' Shutters Sundin and her service as an officer in  the U.S. Army. I am especially grateful for her support to my office as  an Army congressional fellow from January to December 2017 and, later,  as the Army congressional budget liaison, where she supported my  responsibilities as the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations  Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. Major  Shutters Sundin will complete her military service in November after  more than 12 years of honorable service.  A native of Muskegon, MI, Major Shutters Sundin entered the military  as a paralegal in the Indiana Army National Guard. After completing her  initial military training, she attended Wentworth Military Academy and  Junior College in Lexington, MO, where she commissioned as a second  lieutenant. She completed her undergraduate degree in sociology at the  University of Central Missouri and accessed nto Active-Duty status as  an aviation officer. She attended flight school at Fort Rucker, AL, in  2008, graduating as a UH-60 Blackhawk pilot. She also has a master's  degree in legislative affairs from the George Washington University.  Major Shutters Sundin has served in a number of assignments during  her Army career. Her first assignment as an aviation officer was with  the 5th Battalion, 101st Combat Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne  Division at Fort Campbell, KY. As a small unit leader in Alpha Company,  she deployed her platoon to multiple joint training exercises and  ultimately to Khost Province in eastern Afghanistan in support of  Operation Enduring Freedom 12-13. While in combat, she served as task  force intelligence officer, where she was charged with leading an  intelligence unit that provided threat analysis, briefings to aircrews  and leadership, and assisted military decision making.  Upon redeployment, Major Shutters Sundin attended the Maneuver  Captains Career Course at Fort Benning, GA, in preparation for her  company command at Hunter Army Airfield, GA. There, she commanded Bravo  Company, 4th Battalion, 3rd Combat Aviation Brigade from January 2014  to February 2016. Major Shutters Sundin's team of 42 personnel and 10  UH-60M assault helicopters supported a number of training exercises to  include a 9-month deployment in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve.  Bravo Company was the first aviation unit to be a [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7073\">Page S7073</a>, ] persistent presence in Eastern Europe, where they flew across the  Baltic States and Poland to strengthen NATO relationships while  deterring against the threat of Russian aggression.  In 2017, as an Army congressional fellow, I had the privilege of  working with Major Shutters Sundin in my office for a year and during  her subsequent assignment as the Army congressional budget liaison. She  worked tirelessly with Members of Congress and their staff to  accurately represent the Army's budget positions to the Senate and  House Appropriations Committees. Her professionalism, diligence, and  commitment to the mission are unmatched, and her work as a fellow and  as a liaison well represented the U.S. Army and the Department of  Defense to the U.S. Congress.  The foundation of Major Shutter Sundin's military success is her  family. Raised in the Midwest as one of five children, her family  established particular values early on: service, sacrifice, and  compassion. She is a devoted wife to her husband Carl, who also serves  as an officer in the U.S. Army. Their commitment to service and care  for others infuses every organization to which they belong. Together,  they are examples of servant leaders in the U.S. Army and to their  communities.  Throughout her career, Major Shutters Sundin has positively impacted  soldiers, peers, and superiors. Our country has benefited tremendously  from her extraordinary leadership, judgment, and passion. I join my  colleagues today in honoring her dedication to our Nation and  invaluable service to the U.S. Congress as an Army congressional  liaison.  Mr. President, it has been a pleasure to have worked with a talented  officer. On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my colleagues today in  recognizing and commending MAJ Catherine ``Catie'' Shutters Sundin for  her service to our country and wish her all the best as she explores  new ways to continue her service.    ", "Mr. ROUNDS": " Mr. ROUNDS. I ask for the yeas and nays.    ", "Mr. KING": " Mr. KING. Mr. President, ``The American people should have a voice in  the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this  vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President''--Senator  Mitch McConnell, February 13, 2016. I don't always agree with Senator  McConnell, but I agree with him on that one. This is a violation of our  rules, of our history.  There have been 13 vacancies within the last 10 months of a  Presidential election year in American history. Nine of them were  before July 1. Of those nine, seven were confirmed by the Senate, two  were not: one under President John Tyler and the other was Merrick  Garland.  There have been only four vacancies in the Supreme Court that have  occurred after July 1 of an election year; zero of them have been  confirmed: three in three cases, including Abraham Lincoln. They  weren't even nominees; the President waited until after the election.  In one, there was a nominee; the Senate tabled the nomination. So all  of this talk that we have had about history and precedent, those are  the facts: 13 in the last 10 months, 9 of them before July 1--all were  confirmed except one 150 years ago and Merrick Garland.  I agree with Mitch McConnell on the 13th of February 2016: ``The  American people should have a voice in the selection of their next  Supreme Court Justice. Therefore this vacancy should not be filled  until we have a new President.'' He said that 8 months before the  election.  This confirmation, if it takes place tomorrow, will be 8 days before  the election. It doesn't pass the straight-face test. If there is a  concern about the will of the American people, about one-third of the  voters have already voted. This election is already one-third over, and  yet we are barrelling forward with this nomination. We shouldn't even  be here. We shouldn't even be having this discussion.  One of the reasons we shouldn't be here is that the Judiciary  Committee broke its own rules in order to vote this nomination out.  Here is rule 1 under ``Quorums,'' section III, of the Judiciary  Committee rules: ``Seven Members of the Committee, actually present,  shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of discussing business. Nine  Members of the Committee, including at least two Members of the  minority, shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of transacting  business.''  What an inconvenient rule. But I have to presume that that rule,  which has been there for years, was put there for a reason: in order to  preserve the tradition of comity and respect for the minority that this  body has often stood for.  ``Nine Members of the Committee, including at least two Members of  the minority, shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of transacting  business.'' That quorum wasn't there when this nomination was reported  out.  So we have trampled precedent. We have trampled history. We have even  trampled the rules.  And I know that my colleagues say: But it is in good cause. We need  to get this conservative Justice on the Court. It is for a good cause.  I am reminded of that wonderful play: ``A Man for All Seasons,''  about the ends justifying the means. Roper says: ``So now you'd give  the Devil benefit of law''--the rules?  Sir Thomas More said: ``Yes. What would you do? Cut a great road the  law to get after the Devil?''  Roper said: ``I'd cut down every law in England to do that!''  Then here is the point. This is what More responds:  Oh? And, when the last law was down, and the Devil turned   around on you--where would you hide, Roper, the laws all   being flat? This country's planted thick with laws for coast   to coast--man's laws, not God's--and, if you cut them down--  and you're just the man to do it--d'you really think you   could stand upright with the winds that would blow then? Yes,   I'd give the Devil the benefit of the law, for my own   safety's sake.  That is why we have rules, for all of our safety's sake. But we are  going to violate those rules. We are in the process of violating those  rules.  I have heard a great deal of pearl clutching around here about  packing the Court. Oh, no, somebody is talking about breaking the rules  and packing the Court. Well, of course, article III of the Constitution  doesn't establish how many members of the Supreme Court there should  be. The number of the Supreme Court has been changed seven times in our  history. It has ranged from 4 to 10.  I don't want to pack the Court. I don't want to change the number. I  don't want to have to do that, but if all of this rule-breaking is  taking place, what does the majority expect? What do they expect? They  expect that they are going to be able to break the rules with impunity,  and when the shoe, maybe, is on the other foot, nothing is [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6492\">Page S6492</a>, ] going to happen, that the people over here are just going to say: Oh,  well, we can't change these rules  One of the things that has amazed me since I have come here is how  people feel that they can do things to one another and never have it  have any consequences, never have it come back on them. The shoe may be  on the other foot. We don't know what is going to happen next week.  The other piece of this nomination that bothers me in this process is  that there has been all this talk about qualifications. I would argue  that qualifications isn't the question; it is what kind of judge they  will be. There are thousands of people in this country who are  qualified to be a judge. There are 1,700 Federal judges--almost 2,000.  There are 30,000 State judges. There are lots of people who are  qualified, who have been to law school, who have been judges, who are  smart, who can write opinions. That is not the issue here.  The issue is, what kind of judge will this person make? That is what  is important. What is their philosophy? This is a lifetime appointment.  How are they going to decide important cases? These are important  decisions.  One week after the election, on November 10, we are going to have an  argument in the Supreme Court about the future of the Affordable Care  Act. Literally, tens of millions of people's insurances depend upon  that, not to mention the requirement in the Affordable Care Act, which  is the only legal requirement in the country to protect people with  preexisting conditions.  I am tired of people around here saying, ``I am for protecting  preexisting conditions,'' when they voted to gut the Affordable Care  Act 35, 40, 50 times. The President of the United States signs an  Executive order saying, ``We are going to protect preexisting  conditions.'' It means nothing. It is not worth the paper it is printed  on.  The only way you can protect people with preexisting conditions is to  pass a law that you can do that, and we did it with the Affordable Care  Act. If that law is struck down, 130 million Americans are at risk.  They are at risk. So I want to know what kind of decisions is this  person going to make?  The Affordable Care Act is on the chopping block. A woman's right to  choose is on the chopping block. The scope of government action, what  can we do here in this body, in this Congress, in this government, that  is on the chopping block. Election disputes are on the chopping block.  I am going to talk a little about that later.  But we have this bizarre current practice, where we have a so-called  hearing and there are all these questions, and the witness, the  prospective Justice, says: Well, I can't answer that because that might  come up when I am on the Court. I can't tell you what I think about any  of these things.  It is as if you were courting someone, you are thinking about getting  married--a lifetime commitment, just like a lifetime appointment to the  Court--and in the middle of one of your dates, you say: Well, I really  like to travel. Do you like traveling? And she says: Well, I don't  know. I can't tell you until after we are married. I am not sure. I  couldn't give you a definitive answer to that.  And then you say: Well, I love opera. Now, my favorite thing is to go  to opera. How about you?  Well, I can't answer that question. I can't tell you because that is  hypothetical, and I will tell you when you invite me to an opera after  we are married.  Then you say: Well, how about kids? I really want to have a big  family.  No, I am sorry. I can't answer that question.  That is exactly what is going on in these hearings.  Judge Barrett didn't answer much of anything. ``I can't answer  that.'' I think that is nonsense.  She can say: Here is how I think about that issue now, but I reserve  my right to change my mind in a particular case with particular facts  after I have read the briefs and heard the argument, but here is how I  think about that now.  But no. These hearings are a waste of time. We learned whether or not  she did her laundry, but we didn't learn anything about how she is  going to decide these cases for the next 30 years. This isn't something  abstract. This is going to affect individual Americans' lives; yet we  are not allowed to find out what she really believes.  But do you know what? For these last three nominees, the dark money  folks have spent about $250 million to put them over the finish line; a  quarter of $1 billion have been spent by people--we don't know who they  are--to push these nominations. These folks aren't investing that money  on spec. They know what they are getting. We may not know what they are  getting, but they damn well know what they are getting.  They didn't spend a quarter of $1 billion in the hopes that they knew  what the results were going to be; they know. They know, but we don't.  They are investing; they are not contributing.  We do have some indication of what her philosophy is in the abstract  of she won't answer questions about particular cases, but in the  abstract, we know that she says she is an originalist. She says Antonin  Scalia was her mentor. She was his clerk, so she is an originalist.  What does that mean? Well, it means if you have a provision of the  Constitution, in order to interpret what it means, you look at two  places: You look at the text, what does it say, and then you look at  the intent, the understanding of the text of those 55 men in  Philadelphia in 1787. That is it, period. That is the analysis.  Well, there are a couple of problems with that. Article I, section 8,  authorizes the Congress to raise and support an Army and a Navy. What  about the Air Force? What about the Air Force? It doesn't say Armed  Services; it says Army and Navy.  So we look to the text, Army, Navy--doesn't mention the Air Force--so  let's look at the intent. Do we think that those guys in Philadelphia  looked ahead 115 years to the Wright brothers? Of course not.  That is ridiculous. That is a ridiculous interpretation. Well, so how  do you decide that the Air Force and, more recently, the Space Force is  constitutional? Well, you do a reasonable interpretation. What was the  broad intent? To protect the country. And, therefore, the Air Force and  the Space Force are constitutional.  But by an originalist's standard, neither one passed the test--not in  the text, not in the intent. That is supposed to be the test. It is  nonsense. It is a nonsense theory.  The provision of the Air Force is pretty easy. The President has to  be 35. That is easy. There are two Senators from every State--not  three, not one--two. Those are easy.  But what about a term like ``due process''? What about due process  and the Fifth Amendment? What does that mean in a real case? Can you be  thrown in jail for life and not have access to a lawyer? Is that due  process? It was for about 150 years. It wasn't until the sixties that  right to counsel in the Gideon case became a constitutional right.  Did the courts invent that? No. They were trying to put some life  into this concept of due process. There is no way to determine exactly  what a broad term like ``due process'' meant in 1787 or in 1868 or in  2021. It takes a court to think about it and to apply some growth in  morality, ethics, law, politics, culture, to put life into a provision  like that.  There are other ones. Let's see: Due process, equal protection of the  laws. It took about 100 years to get from the 14th Amendment to Brown  v. Board of Education. So the fact that segregated schools were a  violation of equal protection of the law wasn't very obvious in 1868.  It took 100 years for us to get to the place where, yes, everybody  realizes that that was wrong.  This is one of the fallacies in the originalist theory, and Judge  Barrett was asked about this: What about Brown v. Board of Education?  What about Loving v. Virginia? I was in law school when Loving was  decided. It was illegal in Virginia to have an interracial marriage. It  was illegal in a lot of States. I venture to say it was probably  illegal everywhere in 1868.  But the Court, in 1967, decided that marriage was a fundamental  right, that it was part of the equal protection of the laws, and that  it was wrong to tell people of different races that they couldn't marry  one another.  So how does the originalist handle that case? They don't dare say  that Brown was wrongly decided or Loving [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6493\">Page S6493</a>, ] was wrongly decided. Do you know what they say? Do you know what she  said? It is a superprecedent. Well, come on. That is a label. It  doesn't mean anything. That is a dodge. That is intellectual  dishonesty.  If your theory works, it works. If you have to say that Brown or  Loving or dozens of other cases--Miranda, Gideon--are all  superprecedents, it doesn't speak very well for your theory. It is a  copout.  Now, if Antonin Scalia were here--whom I knew in law school, by the  way. I knew him as Nino. If he were here, he would say: Well, Angus, if  the Constitution needs amending and changing, you don't do it by the  courts; you do it through the amendment process. That is why they wrote  it.  Well, the problem with that is we would be amending the Constitution  about every 2 weeks around here. Can you imagine, if we had to do an  amendment to the Constitution, going through Congress by two-thirds and  three-quarters of the States to legalize the Air Force or to say that  due process means that you don't have to give evidence against  yourself; that you have a right to a lawyer; that you have a right to  be told what your rights are, as is the case in the Miranda decision?  The Space Force. We passed the Space Force last year. We would have  had to also do a constitutional amendment. No. If that were the case,  if we had to do a constitutional amendment every time there is a change  in something in the Constitution, in the meaning of a term in the  Constitution, the Constitution would be as long as the United States  Code. It just doesn't make sense.  The real problem with the originalist theory--and this is Judge  Barrett, and I know she is intelligent, capable, law professor, judge-- for only 3 years, by the way, but 3 years. The real problem is, the  originalist theory to which she subscribes--and she says she subscribes  to it--allows no room for moral or ethical growth. Everything is frozen  in 1787--or 1868 if you are talking about the 14th Amendment.  Jefferson got this. Jefferson wasn't one of the Framers. He was in  France at the time the Constitution was written, but he certainly is  one of the Founders of the country, the author of the Declaration of  Independence, and a successful President.  He wrote an interesting letter in 1816 on exactly this point, exactly  this point. Here is what Jefferson said:  I am certainly not an advocate for frequent and untried   changes in laws and constitutions  That is the way I feel.  But . . . laws and institutions must go hand in hand with   the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more   developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new   truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the   change of circumstances, institutions--  That means us.  --must advance also to keep pace with the times.  Listen to this. He concludes this:  We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which   fitted him as a boy as civilized society to remain ever under   the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.  Now, I don't think our ancestors, the Framers, were barbarous, but  they hadn't really thought about things like right to counsel, right to  be aware of what your rights were under the Constitution as a criminal  defendant. They certainly weren't aware of the awful, awful impacts of  racial segregation and racial segregation in the schools. They weren't  aware of those things.  Jefferson is right. We have to be able to allow our institutions to  change as we become more developed, more enlightened. As new  discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions  change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance  also to keep pace with the times.  Now, I understand the problem with judicial legislation. I don't want  to convert the Supreme Court into an unelected third branch of the  Congress that has lifetime tenure. I get that. The Supreme Court, in  its interpretation of the Constitution, can't be totally unmoored from  the text of the Constitution or the intent of the Framers, but it has  got to take a broader view of what these vague terms like ``due  process,'' ``equal protection of the laws,'' ``privilege and  immunities''--what those things meant and what they mean today as we  have grown and learned--as we have grown and learned.  The other piece of this originalist philosophy and the one that I  think may have the greatest effect as it takes root on the current  Supreme Court is not necessarily in the cases that we are talking about  like Roe v. Wade. It is more cases like the Affordable Care Act or the  Environmental Protection Agency or the FDA or any effort whatsoever  around here to do something about climate change.  This is a straightjacket for the powers of the Federal Government.  That is really what it is all about. That is why those guys invested  $250 million. They want to cripple, strangle, and squeeze the Federal  Government so that it can't act on behalf of the American people. That  is what is going on here. They don't like the regulatory state. They  want to repeal the new deal.  Some originalists even question Social Security and Medicare, beyond  the powers of the Federal Government. That is what is going on here.  Yet, they have a narrow, crabbed view of the powers of the Federal  Government, but these originalist folks have a broad view of the powers  of the State government to impose on your personal rights.  I have always thought of the Constitution as being an elaborate  Vegematic which slices up power so that it isn't concentrated in any  one place. That is what the Constitution is all about. The fundamental  issue of all political science is quis custodes ipsos custodiet, an  ancient Roman question: Who will guard the guardians?  We create a Constitution to give power to people over our lives, and  then how do we control them from abusing us? History tells us it will  always happen. Lord Acton, in the 19th century, said power corrupts and  absolute power corrupts absolutely. Power corrupts. Absolute power  corrupts absolutely.  And the Framers knew this. They were geniuses in terms of  understanding human nature, so they created this elaborate Rube  Goldberg scheme to make it hard to make laws. And, boy, did they  succeed, as we well know. But even after they created this scheme with  two houses and vetoes and conference committees and two-thirds and  treaties and all of this complex institution to make laws, they were  still scared. They were still afraid of the powers of a rampant  majority. They were still afraid of what their government would do to  them.  So they passed the Bill of Rights--the Bill of Rights. I have always  thought of the Bill of Rights as a kind of force field around us as  individuals, things that they can't do to us. They can't take away our  freedom of religion. They can't take away our freedom of speech. They  can't go after the press. The government can't do these things.  The originalists have a narrow view of what the Federal Government  can do to help us, but they have a broad view of what the States can do  to trample on those individual rights. They want to throw us back to a  time when every State has its own rules on these fundamental rights.  I don't think individual Americans' rights should depend on  geography. They shouldn't depend on where they live. Fundamental human  rights that are in the jurisprudence of the U.S. Supreme Court over the  last 150, 200 years should not be kicked back to the States to be  compromised or minimized.  Finally, what is going on here is an undermining of confidence. We  take this whole thing for granted--these magnificent halls, the marble  columns, the speeches, the votes. It has always happened; therefore, it  always will.  No. We are an experiment. We are an experiment that has been going on  for a little over 200 years. In human history, we are a blip. We are an  anomaly. Democracy is very unusual and very hard, and it depends on  trust. If you stop and think about it, it depends on trust.  When my town clerk in Brunswick, ME, says ``Here are the votes--Trump  87, Biden 104,'' I trust that those are the right numbers. I trust. If  I don't, then that way lies chaos.  What this Senate is doing right now is one more drip in the  undermining of confidence in this institution. It is no secret that  confidence in Congress has plummeted over the last 25 or 30 years, and  we are doing it. We are adding one more brick to that wall of lack of  confidence in this process by violating our [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6494\">Page S6494</a>, ] history and our rules to barrel through to a confirmation that I think  is inconsistent with the rules and principles of this body and our own  personal obligations.  This is a blow to the Senate. What this process says is that anything  goes as long as you have the votes. We don't care about the rules of  the Judiciary Committee. We don't care about the history and traditions  of the Senate. If you have the votes, ram it through.  This body is built on some restraint, on some rules of comity and  restraint and responsibility and thinking of what happens next.  You are going to win this. You have the votes. You are going to put  this judge through--but at the cost of just pulling one more support  out from underneath the edifice of this magnificent government. It is  not only a blow to this institution; it is a blow to the Court. It is a  blow to the Court, and here is why.  Of all the things that Judge Barrett said and didn't say in her  hearing, the one that disturbed me the most was her failure to commit  to recusing herself if a matter comes before the Court shortly after  her confirmation involving this election of her patron, Donald J.  Trump.  That is a gimme. Do you know why? Because all the Court has is its  credibility. The Court doesn't have an army. It doesn't have the power  of the purse. All it has is its integrity, its reputation for fairness.  If you go out that door and look up, it says ``Equal Justice Under  Law.'' That is what it is all about.  The judicial canons speak to this issue very directly. Often in our  lives we all want to avoid impropriety, but the judicial canons go even  further: 2A of the judicial canon says that a judge must avoid the  appearance of impropriety. What could appear to be more improper than a  judge appointed by a President of the United States, and 10 days later  she votes on a matter that will involve his election?  He has already told us he wants this election to go to the Supreme  Court, and he has already told us he wants his Justice there. That is  corruption in realtime. That is impropriety right in front of our eyes.  That answer alone should have disqualified her if she didn't have the  integrity to say: Of course I won't vote on an election matter  involving this President. Of course I won't.  But she didn't. As far as I'm concerned, that is a disqualification.  Now, I am not a Supreme Court Justice. I wasn't on the law review. I am  an old country lawyer from Brunswick, ME. But I know impropriety when I  see it, and this is it. This is it.  The Constitution is a wonderful document. It has served this country  well. The evolution of jurisprudence through the U.S. Supreme Court,  with fits and starts, has generally served this country well. But to  put a Justice on this Court under these procedures, under these  circumstances, who we are pretty sure is going to take positions  antithetical to those of the majority of Americans and could take  positions that will be profoundly damaging to a majority of Americans  is an abdication of our responsibility.  I understand that the majority has the votes. I deeply hope that,  tonight or tomorrow morning, some Members of the majority will wake up  and have an attack of conscience and say: I can't do this. It is not  right. It is not right. I can't sacrifice the reputation of the Senate,  compromise the reputation of the Supreme Court, undermine the  procedures and history of this body. I can't do it.  I hope four Members of the majority will find it in their hearts and  minds to take that position. I am not optimistic, but I think we all  need to go into this decision, and I think all those who vote tomorrow  have to understand what they are doing and what it means and what it  will mean to the people of this country.  We could have done better. We should have done better. We owe it to  the American people to do better than this.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. HEINRICH": " Mr. HEINRICH.

While we still have so much to be thankful for, the COVID-19 pandemic  means folks will be traveling less and might not be celebrating in  larger groups. As a result, many will be separated from their loved  ones on this very special day.  But, folks, this is a very familiar feeling for anyone who has ever  served in our Nation's Armed Forces. There is no vacation from  protecting our Nation. At any given moment, thousands of men and women,  moms and dads, brothers and sisters, are stationed around the world,  standing vigilant in the defense of freedom.  Those wearing the uniform aren't the only ones making a sacrifice,  either. Back home, there is an empty seat at the family table. There  are kids missing their mom or dad, as my daughter missed me while I was  deployed. Parents are missing a child, and husbands and wives are  missing a spouse.  Due to COVID, many who are stationed in the United States can't even  travel home to be with their families. My own daughter will not be able  to travel over Thanksgiving. Restrictions have been put in place  prohibiting nonessential travel to or from many military installations,  including Camp Dodge in my home State of Iowa. But every day, not just  Thanksgiving, can be a sacrifice when serving in the Armed Forces.  Those who enlist are well aware of this. Yet it is no deterrent.  As a combat veteran with over 23 years of service between the Army  Reserves and the Iowa Army National Guard, I understand what many  families are going through, and I have a deep sense of gratitude for  the sacrifice our men and women in uniform make for the good of their  neighbors.  Just last year, I visited our Iowa troops for Thanksgiving in  Afghanistan. It was good to see them, and I know how much they were  missing their families. They also want to make sure that the people  back home remember them--remember that they are far from home, remember  that they are working hard to protect our freedoms.  Our courageous servicemembers know the real cost of freedom. They  have seen and felt it firsthand. Many of them live with that price the  rest of their lives. Far too many who survive combat continue fighting  an internal battle when they return home.  That is why I have made it a top priority to work across the aisle to  combat suicide and mental health struggles among our veterans. My most  recent effort would designate a Buddy Check Week to educate veterans on  how to conduct peer wellness checks. It is a really simple measure that  could go a long way to support the health and safety of those who have  bravely served our Nation.  During this Thanksgiving season, we also must continue to show our  gratitude for those who are putting their own health and lives at risk  by serving on the frontlines in our fight against COVID-19.  Throughout this pandemic, there have been over 850 Iowa National  Guardsmen working to deliver personal protective equipment, food, and  medical supplies all across the State of Iowa. Having served in the  Iowa Army National Guard for many, many years, I could not be more  proud of their tireless and selfless efforts. That is why I [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7058\">Page S7058</a>, ] have introduced legislation to provide tax-free hazardous duty pay for  our National Guard men and women to recognize the work they are doing  during this pandemic and provide them the pay they deserve.  I know I speak on behalf of all Iowans when I say I am truly thankful  for all of those who have ever served our Nation in uniform, and also  to their families. This month we honor and appreciate all the  sacrifices our military families make to support loved ones who are  serving our Nation in uniform.  While this Thanksgiving might look a little different, let's not  forget to be grateful for the freedoms and the blessings we have in  this truly great country.  May God bless all Iowans, including those serving overseas and those  caring for strangers during this pandemic. I am thankful for the  opportunity to serve you.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mrs. CAPITO": " Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I would like to thank, first of all, the  preceding speaker, Senator Klobuchar, for her efforts to help those  venues in those entertainment areas that at this point have been left  out. We certainly have some of those in West Virginia, and I am pleased  to say that the coronavirus package we are putting together today will  help those folks and hopefully get them over the hump.  Before I begin, I would like to wish everybody, as much as they can,  a happy holiday and a joyful new year. Turning the page of 2020 is  something I think we are all pretty anxious to do. Sometimes it seems  like the longest year, and sometimes it seems like the shortest year,  but it definitely seems like ``Groundhog Day'' a lot of the year.  I am very pleased that we have this relief package in front of us.  While I am glad an agreement has been reached, we certainly should have  done this earlier and could have done this earlier. We have been  working since July to deliver targeted additional relief through  efforts such as we put forward in the CARES Act, and it has been voted  down twice--once in September and once in October.  To date, we, the Republicans, have offered targeted relief  legislation, voted in favor of enhanced employment benefits, more money  for our schools, which would have been great to have had in early  September and should have had in early September. We voted in favor of  stand-alone emergency funding for the Paycheck Protection Program,  which we know is exceedingly important, and more dollars for vaccines  and testing so that we could get the great news of the vaccine that we  see coming forward out to everybody in this country. We offered all  kinds of ideas to the other side, but they blocked it--all of it. I am  glad to say that after all this, we have finally joined together,  realizing that, yes, a deal is better than no deal.  Last week, unfortunately, a very good friend of mine passed away  after battling coronavirus. At one point in her life, she was a small  business owner. I thought so much about her over the last several  weeks. I thought, what would she say if she knew that months ago, as a  small business owner, we could have delivered the same help to her that  we are delivering today.  We have to do better by the people we represent. It is disappointing  that politics has gotten in the way. It is disappointing and, quite  frankly, insulting, in my view, when I see the Speaker of the House  admitting to holding out on this relief because she thought it would be  beneficial politically in the end. We can do much better than this.  I am also a proud member of the Appropriations Committee. We have [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7895\">Page S7895</a>, ] worked hard to get these funds and resources where they are most  needed, especially in a year like this one. But due to delays,  critically needed resources to combat the opioid epidemic have had to  wait; investments to improve broadband have had to wait; research  dollars into Alzheimer's have had to wait; and the list goes on. This  is so frustrating to me, as it should be to every American, and I know  they are frustrated because they tell us they are.  But here now, we were able to include funds for things that are  important to me in my State of West Virginia, such as fossil energy  research, our universities, and the many Federal facilities that call  West Virginia home.  I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation that  reflects our Nation's priorities and funds the government, which is our  responsibility as Members of Congress.  Within the Omnibus appropriations act is the fiscal year 2021  Homeland Security appropriations bill. I chair that subcommittee, and  it is with great pride that I can report to the American people and to  West Virginians that this title invests billions of dollars to protect  our homeland.  We maintain our commitment to border security through a border wall  system to include physical barriers and enhanced technologies.  We avoided a drastic cut to our cyber security capabilities that we  see we need now more than ever after all of the reports and the vicious  cyber attack that we uncovered that has been launched against many of  those in our country, not just the government but the private sector as  well.  We continue our commitment to use every resource at our disposal in  the effort to prevent those opioids that are killing our people. We see  overdoses going up and deaths from overdoses going up during this  pandemic. We tried to get the resources to our Homeland Security folks  to prevent those drugs from entering into this country at all.  The men and women at the Department of Homeland Security work  constantly against threats both old and new, traditional and emerging,  and deserve the support this legislation gives them.  So while this is great news in the end, I will repeat what I said  earlier, and that is, Congress can do better. We could have done this  earlier, and it should have been done earlier. So there is no reason we  should be standing here several days before Christmas discussing the  items that were ready to go several months ago, but we are where we  are. As we turn the page gleefully into 2021, I think we should all  pledge to one another and to the country that we will do better, that  we will work better with each other and prevent politics from infecting  every decision that could positively impact so many people in this  country.  Lastly, I give a hat tip to my friend, whom I will miss seeing and  who was a great friend to our family, a longtime friend of our family.  Godspeed. I know she is dancing up there with her mom and dad because  they loved to dance.    ", "Mr. PERDUE": " Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the great work  of the Georgia Greater Black Chamber of Commerce. The Georgia Greater  Black Chamber has focused on recognizing the integral contributions of  Black-owned businesses to the strength of both our State and our  Nation's economy during National Black Business Month in Auqust. For 7  straight years, Georgia has been named the No. 1 place in the country  in which to do business, and the Georgia Greater Black Chamber has been  instrumental in making that possible.  As I mentioned, August was National Black Business Month, and the  Georgia Greater Black Chamber celebrated by honoring an important  Georgian: Mr. Herman J. Russell. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S5894\">Page S5894</a>, ]  H. J. Russell was the epitome of the American entrepreneur. Despite  all the obstacles in his way, he worked hard to achieve his dreams. His  business started as a plastering company, and he grew it into one of  Atlanta's best real estate developers. Anywhere you look in Atlanta,  you will see the incredible landmarks that the H.J. Russell Company has  worked on: the Georgia Dome, Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, and  Castleberry Hill. As a business guy myself, I am inspired by all that  Herman J. Russell did in his life. Simply put, Atlanta would not be  what it is today without H.J. Russell and the H.J. Russell Company. His  children carry on this entrepreneurial spirit to this day. I recently  had the opportunity to visit with his sons Michael and Jerome. They and  their sister Donata Russell Ross are dedicated to continuing Black  entrepreneurship.  Recently, I had the privilege of visiting the Russell Center for  Innovation and Entrepreneurship--RCIE--with Housing and Urban  Development Secretary Ben Carson. The Russell Center assists African- American entrepreneurs by providing workspace, networking  opportunities, and educational resources. In 2019, RCIE converted a  43,000-square-foot corporate headquarters into space for 100 emerging  entrepreneurial companies. RCIE is a testament to the efforts of  African-American entrepreneurs to uplift each other.  As the Georgia Greater Black Chamber and other organizations in my  State look to support growth in Black business and entrepreneurship, I  will continue to work to support them. Through a recent conversation  with Dr. David Thomas, president of Morehouse College, I was made aware  that approximately 45 percent of the young men who start as freshmen at  Morehouse will not graduate. I have appealed to the Georgia business  community to support HBCU's and hire their graduates as part of the  solution to this problem. I was also proud to work with Congressman  David Scott on a scholarship program for the ``1890s'' land grant  institutions like Fort Valley State to help ensure they can continue to  produce farmers and agri-businesses that are of critical importance to  Georgia's economic future.  African-American entrepreneurship and business ownership accounts for  nearly 3 million businesses in the United States and nearly a million  employees. Before COVID-19, African-American unemployment was at its  lowest point in U.S. history. These are remarkable statistics, but we  must continue to advance the important work of supporting Black  businesses, as this is key to empowering communities and individuals to  move out of poverty and into prosperity.  I look forward to working with the Georgia Great Black Chamber of  Commerce and other Chambers in Georgia to ensure Georgia remains the  best place in America for all businesses.    ", "Mr. MANCHIN": " Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, it is an honor to rise today to recognize the legacy of MG James A. Hoyer of the West Virginia National Guard, a man whom I have worked with for decades and a man whom I am fortunate to call my friend. General Hoyer assumed the duties as The Adjutant General, West Virginia Joint Forces Headquarters-West Virginia in 2011, providing command guidance and vision to the West Virginia Army and Air National Guard of more than 6,500 Citizen Soldiers and Airmen. Upon obtaining his undergraduate degree from the University of Charleston, he was commissioned in 1983 through a joint Reserve Officer Training Corps program with West Virginia State University. General Hoyer's military career began in the West Virginia National Guard as a Cavalry Officer. He attended the Special Forces Officer Qualification course and spent more than 14 years with the 2nd Battalion, 19th Special Forces Group. General Hoyer led the development of the West Virginia National Guard Counterdrug Task Force and the Joint Interagency Training and Education Center and its Center for National Response--a national level operational and training capability for critical infrastructure protection and consequence response. General Hoyer's most recent assignment was Director, Joint Staff, of the West Virginia Joint Force Headquarters. General Hoyer continued his education throughout his career, including West Virginia Graduate College in 1987, United States Army War College in 2004, and obtained his Federal/Department of Defense Identify Management Certificate from the Naval Post Graduate School in 2009. Among his many awards, decorations and achievements, General Hoyer has earned the Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal (with 1 Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster), Army Commendation Medal (with 1 Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster), Army Achievement Medal (with 2 Bronze Oak Leaf Clusters), Army Reserve Component Achievement Medal (with 1 Silver Oak Leaf Cluster), National Defense Service Medal (with 1 Bronze Service Star), Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Armed Forces Reserve Medal (with Silver Hourglass and M Device), Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, Army Reserve Component Overseas Training Ribbon, West Virginia Commendation Medal, West Virginia Emergency Service Ribbon, West Virginia State Service Ribbon, West Virginia Service Ribbon, West Virginia Counterdrug Ribbon, West Virginia Distinguished Unit Award, Special Forces Tab, Master Parachutist Badge, Air Assault Badge, and the Thailand Parachute Badge. I have seen firsthand how the Guard protects the citizens of West Virginia when we are in our most desperate hour of need and how the Guard protects our country when called upon to serve at the command and control of the President of the United States. As Governor, my most honored title was that of Commander-in-Chief of the Guard. I worked closely with Jim Hoyer and the Guard and did everything I could to increase capabilities for personnel, equipment, and facilities. As U.S. Senator, I have the honor of serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee, as well as the Appropriations Committee, the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and as ranking member on the Senate Energy Committee. I continue to work hand-in-hand with Jim Hoyer to promote good policy for the Guard, the Department of Defense, and all of our Nation's heroes. Throughout my time as Governor and as Senator, I have relied on the National Guard not only to do their mission but to provide solid advice so that I could form the best policies. I have truly counted on Jim Hoyer's sound guidance and military expertise every step of the way. Whether it was forming the Congressional Veterans Jobs Caucus, writing amendments on the Defense bill, preventing war in Syria, providing death gratuity benefits for families of the fallen during a government shutdown, or bringing more military assets like the C-130J to West Virginia, Jim Hoyer has been with me every step of the way. The West Virginia National Guard fulfills its mission of ``Delivering Freedom with Courage'' every single day. I am so very proud of the Guard for serving our State and our Nation so courageously in times of need, and I am grateful for their unwavering service and selfless efforts to protect our homeland. This success is due in large part to the Guard's outstanding leadership, and I am grateful to General Hoyer for serving as a part of this legacy of excellence. When visitors come to West Virginia, I jump at the chance to tell them we have fought in more wars, shed more blood, and lost more lives for the cause of freedom than most any State. We have always done the heavy lifting and never complained. We have mined the coal and forged the steel that built the guns, ships, and factories that have protected and continue to protect our country to this day. I am so deeply proud of what West Virginians have accomplished and what they will continue to accomplish to protect the freedoms we hold dear. While General Hoyer is retiring and everyone is sure to miss his strong leadership, his dedication and commitment to excellence will leave a lasting legacy with the countless lives he has touched. Again, I congratulate General Hoyer for his remarkable years of service and his outstanding dedication to protecting our great Nation. I am honored to wish good health and much happiness to him, his wife Amy, his sons Jacob and Drew, and his wonderful extended family in the days and years ahead.<bullet>   ", "Mr. BURR": " Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their time  tonight, and I urge all of our colleagues to prepare. This will be back  up.  I yield the floor    ", "Mr. WARNER": " Mr. WARNER. I agree. I strongly supported each of the five  whistleblower protection provisions in the IAA. It is my intent to keep  fighting for them so that they are on next year's IAA and are passed  into law.    ", "Mr. SHELBY": " Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to start by thanking my good  friend Senator Lamar Alexander for his nearly two decades in the Senate  and his longstanding devotion to improving our country. His dedication  to the people of Tennessee and Americans throughout our Nation has been  unwavering. We have served together in the Senate for 18 years, but he  has been in public service for much longer than that.  I remember when Senator Alexander was first elected to the Senate in  2002. He was no stranger to his new colleagues. Lamar had already  served as the Governor of Tennessee, the president of the University of  Tennessee, and the Secretary of Education under George H.W. Bush. He  also ran for President in 1996 and again in 2000.  We should have seen the writing on the wall then--that Senator  Alexander would be one of the smartest and most ambitious Members we  would serve with throughout our careers.  Born in Maryville, TN, Lamar graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vanderbilt  University and went on to receive his juris doctor from the New York  University, NYU, School of Law. He then clerked on the Fifth Circuit  for Judge John Minor Wisdom in New Orleans.  Following his time in Louisiana, he moved to Washington to work as a  legislative assistant for then-Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee. This  is when he met his beloved wife Honey. They married and had four  children, and his remarkable career took off.  During Lamar's time as a U.S. Senator, he served as the chairman of  the [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7936\">Page S7936</a>, ] Senate Republican conference, an important leadership position in which  he influenced his fellow Members to accomplish conservative  achievements by working in unison.  Currently, Lamar is the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions, HELP, Committee-- a``Class A'' committee in the Senate. In  2016, he was instrumental in passing the overwhelmingly bipartisan 21st  Century Cures Act--landmark legislation that has brought new  innovations and advances to patients who need them faster and more  efficiently.  I have been blessed to serve with Lamar on the Senate Rules Committee  and the Senate Appropriations Committee, where he is the current  chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development.  In this role on Appropriations, he has supported and advanced a host  of important national priorities, such as nuclear security, critical  infrastructure projects across the country, and the science and  research taking place at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I, along  with my colleagues on the committee, am grateful for his hard work to  craft many years of significant and influential funding measures.  Lamar came to the Senate as a staffer and is leaving as chairman of  one of the largest and most significant committees in the Senate. His  impact and leadership during his time here has been both substantial  and constructive.  Lamar and I have travelled the world together. Annette and I have  enjoyed the many hours spent with Honey and him. He will be missed in  the Senate. I thank Senator Alexander for his dedication to the  betterment of our country and wish him all the best in his next chapter  of life.    ", "Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina": " Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. President, today I would like to take a moment to recognize a milestone achievement for a ministry in my State. The Academy of Arts Ministries is celebrating its 50th anniversary in South Carolina on January 8, 2021. This ministry has trained thousands of students in the arts and sent them out in their local communities to share the Good News about God through their art. Its founder, Dr. Nicky Chavers, has dedicated the last 50 years to giving young people a safe avenue to be creative through the Logos Theatre, nation-wide traveling ministries, a professional film company and more. The young people in my great state of South Carolina have truly benefited from the sacrifices of Dr. Chavers and the entire team at the Academy of Art Ministries.<bullet>   ", "Mr. CASSIDY": " Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, Mr. Emile Oestriecher, known in the Scouting community as ``Mr. O,'' has served the community of Alexandria as Boy Scout scoutmaster for almost 50 years. [[<a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7588\">Page S7588</a>]] Troop 6, sponsored by St. Frances Cabrini Church, has been in existence since 1967. When Mr. O became. scoutmaster, it had about 12 Scouts; today that number is between 60 and 70. Mr. O, the founding partner in the Alexandria CPA firm Oestriecher &amp; Company, CPAs, has received the Distinguished Public Service Award by the Louisiana CPA Society and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. He has been honored with many awards from the Scouting community as well as other local organizations. Mr. O has led trips to destinations like Philmont Scout Ranch and Canada Canoe trips, as well as taught other adult leaders across the Nation and represented the area at four national Scout jamborees. Now, his oldest scouts are in their 60s, but he is still there as scoutmaster. He has several ``grandscouts,'' whose fathers were members of troop 6 under him, and one ``great-grandscout,'' who shared the same scoutmaster as his grandfather. Troop 6 has had over 160 Eagle Scouts during his tenure scoutmaster and six of his Scouts have been ordained as Catholic priests. He certainly lives the Scout Law every day and epitomizes the troop 6 motto ``Optimus Optimorum''-- Best of the Best. We thank Mr. O for his dedication to being scoutmaster and being a good influence on so many young men in his community.<bullet>   ", "Mr. SASSE": " Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:57 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, December 16, 2020, at 10 a.m    ", "Mr. ROMNEY": " Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the career of a  remarkable public servant whose accomplishments have left an indelible  mark upon our State and upon our country. Congressman Rob Bishop has  earned his place among the greats in Utah's political history, and we  thank him for his service.  Rob has dedicated his political career to fighting the tough battles  over issues that matter to the people of my State, from the virtue of  federalism, States' rights, and protecting individual liberty, to  promoting a strong national defense and sound public lands policy. And  fight he did.  Four years ago, Puerto Rico was fast approaching a fiscal cliff when  Rob, as chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, led a  successful, bipartisan effort to pass a complicated rescue package to  restructure Puerto Rico's debt before it was too late.  While Rob will never rush to take credit or seek the spotlight, his  legislative achievements are enduring and deserve our full praise and  recognition.  His accomplishments manifest closer to home as well. The brave men  and women of our military and civilian workforce at Hill Air Force Base  know Rob as a tremendous advocate and a devoted friend. Through the War  on Terror, improvements and changes in aircraft, and updates to our  nuclear arsenal, Rob has defended our Hill Air Force Base valiantly. At  Dugway Proving Ground in Tooele, his commitment delivered the  completion of an emergency aircraft runway.  Rob's impressive efforts and steady leadership have raised Utah's  profile for our national defense. So, too, has his advocacy for the  Utah Test and Training Range, so it makes sense that this key to our  Nation's military readiness should bear his name. Next Congress, I  intend to introduce a bill to rename it the ``Bishop Utah Test and  Training Range.''  Rare is a man with such professional distinction, intellect, and  personal conviction for the well-being of family, neighbors, and  strangers alike, who carries himself with such humility as Rob. If you  have had the pleasure of being with Rob at a gathering, you know where  to find him at the end of the night--staying behind to help gather the  chairs.  Most of all, Rob is a teacher. From his time as a public school  teacher to his career in public service, one of his highest priorities  has been ensuring that the next generation of young leaders has access  to educational opportunities, not only by securing revenue for public  school as an elected official but also by devoting his time to host  students in the Capitol to teach them about politics, policy, and our  government.  It is an honor to recognize my friend Rob Bishop as he begins his  next chapter with his wife Jeralynn and their five children and nine  grandchildren. For anyone who has not had the great pleasure of meeting  Rob, you will likely easily recognize him on the street as maybe the  last man in Washington who wears an impeccable three-piece suit.  Thank you, Rob, and good luck.    ", "Ms. KLOBUCHAR": " Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to thank all of my  colleagues who worked so hard on the bill that is coming to the floor  today, the pandemic relief package.  We know all the top priorities in there--the vaccine distribution-- and I want to thank Senator Schumer and leaders and those on both sides  of the aisle who put more funding into that.  I want to thank the group who has worked so hard on this agreement  and this negotiation in the Senate for their work, including Senator  Manchin and Senator Romney and Senator Warner and Senator Shaheen and  Senator Hassan and Senator Durbin, as well as all of their Republican  colleagues, Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski, Senator Cassidy, who  worked so hard on this original agreement, with many others who joined  in as well.  This bill contains such important priorities, including unemployment  and help for our hospitals and help for our rural areas--housing, rent,  small businesses, unemployment, the direct checks.  I think we all know that there is more work to be done, including  next year, including for our cities and our States, but it is so  important that we get this done by the end of the year.  I wanted to focus on something that I have worked on for quite a  while with Senator Cornyn from Texas. We have done this on a bipartisan  basis from the beginning, and it is the Save Our Stages Act.  When we first introduced it in July, we knew that it was going to be  a long road, and we also knew that the only way we would get this done  is by sticking together as a team and by working with other Members of  Congress from red and blue States. And by the end--this bill is  included in full in this package--we had 57 Senators who sponsored this  bill out of 100, with many more supporting it. We had over 200 House  Members.  We worked so hard to make this about America and American music and  American theater and American culture.  We all know that you can't go stand in a mosh pit in the middle of a  pandemic. These live entertainment venues were among the first  businesses to close, and they will almost certainly be among the last  to reopen.  This was about, yes, Nashville and New York, but it was just as much  about the Fargo Theater or a small, small country music venue in Texas.  And while we see the light at the end of tunnel with the vaccines, we  know that it will be quite a while before these businesses, which  operate on such thin margins as it is, can keep going.  I think we also know the importance of the arts and music, not only  as a cultural icon in America but also as an economic driver. It is one  of our No. 1 exports, when you combine all of it. And the fact that we  were able to stick together with not only the nitty-gritty of this bill  and this coalition and actually add partners as we went along is a  tribute to all the musicians out there, all the venues, all the  lighting operators, all the truckers--everyone who came together and  said: We are going to get this done.  I know when Senator Cornyn and I first introduced this, people kind  of patted us on the head and said: Oh, this sounds nice. But I think  when people started to hear the facts and how much this matters to  economies and even small towns, it made a difference. In the end, to  quote Minnesota's own Bob Dylan from ``The Times They Are a-Changin,''  he says:  Come senators, congressmen  Please heed the call  Don't stand in the doorway  Don't block the hall  No one blocked the hall.  I want to thank my colleagues, and I want to especially thank Senator  Cornyn. We have led many bills together, and we had to go back and  forth a lot. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7894\">Page S7894</a>, ]  I want to thank Dayna Frank, who is the head of First Avenue in  Minnesota, made famous, of course, by Prince.  Prince wouldn't be Prince if not for First Avenue. Everyone in our  State, when they think about First Avenue, they think about Prince.  She is the head of the National Venue Association. She called me one  night in the beginning of the pandemic and said: I just can't make it  through this without some help.  They already received PPP loans, but that is not enough for these  venues because of the unique circumstance where they can't partially  open. You can't go to a theater right now and sit elbow-to-elbow with  your friends and family.  I also want to thank my legislative director, Doug Calidas, who has  worked on this from the beginning, including all the last month's late- night negotiations. He did a wonderful job.  I want to thank Senators Schumer and McConnell and Representatives  Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy for getting this over the finish  line--Senator McConnell for putting it in his original bill and Senator  Schumer, who cares so much about this because of all of the great music  and acts and everything coming out of New York State. It was certainly  very, very helpful--and that would put it mildly--to have Senator  Schumer in the room where it happened, where the last negotiations were  made.  I also want to thank Senators Shaheen and Collins, who worked on this  in the original negotiation; Senators Cardin and Rubio with the Small  Business Committee, who made this a priority; and finally, our House  authors, our bipartisan House authors out there, Representatives Welch  and Williams, for their work.  So how this works--the Small Business Administration will create a  new $15 billion grant program to help venues cover 6 months of expenses  and make it through this pandemic. We are very hopeful that once the  summer comes, we are going to see more and more openings because of the  vaccine, because of what I hope will be, with a new administration, an  increased emphasis on testing, and that we will see more and more  venues able to open.  The grants can be used to cover all the major costs the venues have  to pay to stay in business, including rent and mortgage, utilities,  employee wages, key benefits, maintenance costs, State and local taxes,  payments to contractors, and purchases of protective equipment.  Venues that are at the greatest risk of closing--sadly, we have  already lost a number of our venues--will have priority access to the  majority of the grant funding. All venues will be able to apply within  4 weeks of the program's launch with the Small Business Administration,  but in the first 2 weeks, those venues that have suffered 90 percent  revenue loss over the year before will be the first to be able to apply  for these grants.  So we in Congress don't want to let the music die, and we don't want  that to happen to any of our other places of culture in America either.  That is why over the last month or so, we have worked with the museums  and with the zoos, and I want to especially thank Senator Schumer for  his work on that, as well as Senator Blunt and many others who worked  with us--as well as the movie theaters.  We wanted to make sure that if we expanded our coalition, that we  didn't hurt the originals, which were these small, small theaters and  small music venues across the country. We did not do that, because this  new program will be a lifeline for small entertainment venues across  the country, such as First Avenue and the Bluestem Amphitheater in  Moorehead, MN.  It will also help the millions of Americans who work behind the  scenes and who have been sidelined, from the engineers and truckdrivers  to the ticket takers and the designers and the spot operators. It will  help revive the local economies of neighborhoods and small towns across  this Nation.  It is not every day that a coalition sticks together from beginning  to end, that they kept with their original purpose, haven't been picked  off, haven't gotten into infighting, but this group did it. Maybe it is  because so many Americans at home right now cherish music and  entertainment and that part of America like they have never done  because they are watching things alone. They are listening to concerts  by themselves. They are listening to them with their iPhones, or they  are listening to them on their computers, and it is not quite the same.  We also know that all of these artists don't exactly get a big boost  up by themselves with huge funding when they first start out. So many  of them start out at these little venues--a country music band playing  at the Bluestem Amphitheater; a little local theater troupe trying out  a new play in Lanesboro, MN. They can't do it without these venues.  So today we celebrate the fact that we held together. Not only are we  passing this bill as a part of this package, we actually brought in  friends, and we brought in partners, and we made it an even bigger deal  than it was to begin with.  So as I began by quoting the great Bob Dylan from Minnesota, I will  end. He once said:  Well, I sing by night, wander by day.  I'm on the road and it looks like I'm here to stay.  Finally, we are reaching out to this group of employees and these  businesses and saying: We want you to be here to stay.  So thank you to Save Our Stages and to all of our colleagues who  worked so hard on this, and special thanks to my friend Senator Cornyn.  Again, when we did this, we didn't know if we would be able to mount  this grassroots effort, but it happened because artists and fans just  wouldn't give up. So thank you very much.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. COONS": " Mr. COONS. Mr. President, 2020 has been a difficult year for so many.  We have lost far too many mothers and fathers, sons and daughters,  sisters and brothers, neighbors and friends.  My own heart and the hearts of many in Delaware grew heavier this  week as we said goodbye in Delaware to a whole series of friends, folks  who had long been champions of our community, folks who were exactly  the sort of people who helped build and sustain community.  I am grateful for the privilege of the floor to speak for a few  minutes about the legacy of these lions of Delaware, these folks who  were giants of service and who gave their hearts to us.  On Monday, we said goodbye to Elaine and Wayne Manlove, who were  loved by so many, and I rise first to pay tribute to them--some of the  most special people I have ever known.  They were killed in a tragic accident literally the day before last  Tuesday's election. On that day, we lost two of Delaware's greatest  diamonds, Mary ``Elaine'' Manlove and Lambert ``Wayne'' Manlove from  Hockessin and Ocean View. It was always striking they went not by their  first names but by their middle names. They were known as Elaine and  Wayne Manlove. These are proud patriots, people dedicated to our State  and community who spent decades giving to others.  Elaine I knew best in her role as State elections commissioner and as  someone who fought hard here for funding for election security and  election systems. The very last time I saw her, she was proudly showing  off the brandnew statewide election system in Delaware. She didn't,  tragically, get to see the fruits of her labor--the deployment of these  new, state-of-the-art digital voting machines. Her many professional  achievements in that role: increasing our voter rolls, modernizing  machines, bringing elections to the classrooms, carrying off just this  last Tuesday a near flawless statewide election. While impressive, it  was just a very small part of who Elaine was.  Deeply proud of her Irish heritage, known for her kindness and her  generosity, her Irish Catholic faith that she and Wayne shared was a  foundation for them and for their family and their lives.  St. Patrick's Day in Wilmington was often the highlight. Elaine was  one of the folks who helped organize the annual St. Patrick's Day mass  and breakfast--a breakfast that raised money for the St. Patrick Center  that serves some of the neediest and most marginalized in Wilmington  but a breakfast that was a celebration of the intersection of faith,  politics, service, hope, and community.  My own wife Annie worked with Elaine for years in New Castle County  government long before her time as the State elections commissioner,  and they remained close for years afterward. Annie knew her as the best  mom and grandmother and friend to so many people.  Margaret Aitkin, one of Elaine's closest friends, who also served  with her and my wife in county government, said:  Elaine never sought the spotlight, and she never tried to   be the center of attention--she was like a warm fire that you   just gravitated towards. She wasn't the life of the party;   she was the reason for the party.  Elaine had a special and giving spirit that had a lasting and  transformative [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6638\">Page S6638</a>, ] difference on thousands of Delawareans, from Kirkwood Soccer, to the  county, to her work for elections, to her deep commitment to her faith,  her family, and her community.  Wayne, her husband of 51 years, was a union electrician, a proud  member of IBEW Local 313 for 53 years. Wayne loved hosting neighborhood  dinners, annual crab feasts, watching his beloved Eagles with family  and friends, and confounding his son because he could never get his  players straight. He loved sharing the Eagles with all three of his  sons.  For Wayne and Elaine, their sons, Matthew, Joe, and Michael, were the  beginning, middle, and end. The Sun rose and set on their boys. They  took huge delight in sharing stories about them with everyone who would  sit still and listen. They did everything it took to put them through  college and through parochial education. They sacrificed hugely for  their children, and it made a lasting difference in their lives.  Once Elaine and Wayne were your friends, they were always your  friends. They brought together people from grade school, high school,  from work, and from all different walks of life. They were strongly  rooted in and connected to St. Elizabeth's parish, where Elaine was  baptized, where they were married, and where they just last year  renewed their vows for their 50th wedding anniversary. On Monday,  hundreds of us gathered to wish them farewell.  So my condolences, my deep and heartfelt condolences go out to  Matthew and Meghan, to Joe, to Michael and Mary, to Elaine's brother  Grant and wife Ruth, and their four grandchildren who gave them such  joy: Catherine, Elizabeth, Margaret, and Finn.  I am turning now to consider another Delawarean and friend, someone I  knew for decades who exemplified character, bravery, and  integrity. Mike Rush--Edward Michael Rush, Jr., who passed away late  last month in Bear, was someone who always rose to the tasks and  challenges at hand--a Marine Corps veteran, a small business owner, a  firefighter, a member of the American Legion, a stalwart of his parish,  and a great friend.  He was a proud graduate of Salesianum High School and Goldey-Beacom  College and a proprietor and leader of a family-owned business, Rush  Uniform. He started working there in 1963, and he helped build and lead  his family-owned business for decades.  I first really got to know Mike through the Better Business Bureau,  where he and his family sponsored an award for ethical behavior by a  family-owned business. He sponsored the Edward M. Rush, Sr. Memorial  Award.  Mike was also someone whose whole heart was in the fire service. The  volunteer fire service in Delaware is one of the backbones of  communities up and down our State, and he was a life member of two  volunteer fire companies. He was 50 years with Wilmington Manor, 33  years with Christiana, president of the New Castle County Volunteer  Fire Chiefs Association, president of the Delaware Valley Fire Chief's  Association, and then, ultimately, while I was county executive,  president of the Delaware State Fire Chiefs Association.  Mike was also someone who did the hard work of being a fire school  instructor for our State for 30 years. Mike did so much for so many  others through his parish, through his fire company, through his  training service, and through his service to our Nation in the  military. He has earned accolades for his decades of bravery and his  commitment to our community.  But more than anything, because I was not able to make it to his  service, I wanted to share my condolences and the gratitude of our  State and Nation for Mike's wife of 45 years, Winnie; his sisters  Barbara and Catherine; his children Megan and Barbara; and his beloved  grandson Seamus.  Let me now turn to another anchor of another community in our State  and offer greetings and condolences to the family and the beloved of  Pastor Lottie Lee-Davis. She was an ordained minister from the east  side of Wilmington and a hallmark of resiliency and faith. She was a  preacher's daughter, a voice for the voiceless, and a beacon of hope  for many.  A friend, Alethea Smith-Tucker, told our Delaware News Journal that  it was unending how many people Pastor Davis had touched and encouraged  without judgment and without regard. She was the devoted pastor at Be  Ready Jesus is Coming Church. She answered the call to serve beyond the  confines of the pulpit. She provided housing for single mothers and  their children. She led efforts to renovate parks for the community,  and she recently garnered funding to build a mixed-use property just a  block from her church to provide housing for those in need.  Sadly, that which she launched, she will not get to see come to  fruition in this life, but I am confident that Pastor Davis will  continue to inspire and engage and move the community of Wilmington,  the congregation she helped lead, and the families who will benefit for  years to come from her vision and her leadership of this project she  just launched. Her legacy will continue to live through her work.  I wanted to give my condolences to her husband Flalandas; to her  daughter Amira; and to members of the congregation, family, and  friends.  Last, but certainly not least, this past week we lost someone beloved  to me and to so many in the Hockessin community, Gloria Ignudo Corrozi.  Gloria was a mainstay of one of the landmark couples of our State for  decades.  Gloria spent 30 years working at DuPont, and like so many of her  generation who had a successful career at DuPont, she also was engaged  in lots and lots of other community activities, engagements, and  services. She spent a lot of her life also helping the Delaware Chapter  of the American Diabetes Association. She served as cochair and raised  tens of thousands of dollars year after year after year for this  important cause.  But, frankly, her great joy was her family. Her beloved husband of 55  years, Philip Corrozi, was someone who was an incredible mentor and  friend to me at work, at home, and in public service. Phil was an  elected Republican, chairman of the Budget Committee, leader in our  State general assembly, and someone who, with Gloria's tireless  affection and support, crafted lasting solutions for our State.  Gloria was a blessing to an incredible network of friends and family,  nieces and nephews, all of whom knew her as Aunt Gloria. I had the  opportunity to get to know her best in the decade I spent working with  Phil at a global manufacturing firm in Delaware. But Phil Corrozi,  frankly, was someone who, when he gave his heart to a cause, Gloria was  right alongside him and often pushing him. For a woman who never had  children of her own, Gloria had so many people who knew her and thought  of her as a second mother.  My heart goes out to Gloria's family and friends who, today, gathered  at St. Anthony of Padua Church in Wilmington to say their final  goodbyes to this gracious, kind, funny, giving, loving, powerful woman,  whose witness was an important influence on my life, as well as so many  others.  These are just some of the individuals our community has lost this  year. Delaware is a State of neighbors, and we all feel these losses  profoundly.  There was a strong, common thread amongst those I have just honored  and those who have been a gift to our State. I want to return to a  powerful message that Joe, Wayne and Elaine Manlove's son, gave in a  eulogy just Monday at St. Elizabeth Church. It was funny; it was  memorable; it was wide-ranging; it was personal; and it was touching.  But at the conclusion, Joe said this. While today is sad and painful  and so unexpected for all of us, I want to leave you with this thought:  When you leave here today thinking of my parents and feeling the void  in your life, do the following--join a civic committee, help organize  your kids' Little League, volunteer for something you care about, help  a neighbor with a home project, and when some email comes out saying  ``We need people to help,'' respond that you are in. Do all of it  without a thought of compensation. Do it because it is the right thing  to do. Do it because you want to improve the world around you. Do it  because there is nothing more powerful than the heart of a volunteer.  That was them, Wayne and Elaine, but that was also Mike and Lottie  and Gloria and so many other friends and neighbors who helped weave  together [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6639\">Page S6639</a>, ] across different backgrounds, different political parties, and  different places of origin and different communities--they weaved  together a State of neighbors and left a lasting legacy. That legacy is  that we love one another as we have been called to do. May we continue  to be grateful for their legacies of service and live lives that would  make them and their families proud.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    ", "Mrs. LOEFFLER": " Mrs. LOEFFLER. No, I really don't.    ", "Mrs. GILLIBRAND": " Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I rise today to speak about the future of the  Supreme Court, the future of our country, and the responsibility this  body has to the people of our Nation.  It seems that my Republican colleagues have lost sight of what the  people of our States have sent us here to do. They sent us here to  raise their voices, represent their interests, and provide them with  the help they need.  The American people are truly struggling, and they are calling upon  us to provide them with real relief during this public health and  economic crisis. That should be our No. 1 priority.  Eight million Americans have fallen into poverty during this  pandemic, including an outsized number of people of color and children.  The proportion of American children who sometimes do not have enough to  eat is now 14 times higher than it was last year. Parents are now  joining food lines for food banks because they cannot feed their  children. Cases of COVID are on the rise as we head toward our third  peak. Small businesses and their employees don't see a rebound on the  horizon. People are sick. They are struggling and scared about the  future.  For months, my fellow Democrats and I have been calling for a vote on  the relief package the House put forward to address these concerns, and  we have been met with silence. Then, after dragging their feet,  Republicans put forward a totally inadequate $500 billion package that  puts the needs of big businesses ahead of working families. What is  worse is that they know it has absolutely no chance of becoming law.  Their only aim is to score political points, all the while the American  people keep suffering.  The weeks we should have dedicated to negotiating a real relief  package have instead been spent rushing through the confirmation of a  Supreme Court Justice. The hypocrisy is truly stunning. The same people  who denied Merrick Garland a hearing months before an election are now  trying to ram this process through while an election is already  happening. Millions of ballots have already been cast. Millions of  Americans are already voting. Their futures are on the line. They  should have a say in this outcome.  We know why Republicans are rushing. They are rushing because they  know it is their last chance to impose a very extreme conservative view  on this country. They are rushing because they see a clock ticking  toward November, when the Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether  129 million Americans with preexisting conditions will continue to have  access to affordable healthcare. They are rushing to seat Judge Barrett  in time for her to rule on that case--a case that could strip millions  of Americans of healthcare in the middle of a pandemic, at the very  moment they need it the most. It is simply inhumane.  The Affordable Care Act is a matter of life or death. I recently  spoke to a New Yorker named Allie Marotta, who has been living with  type 1 diabetes since 2006. Last December, she turned 26 and aged off  her parents' insurance. Because her work is contract-based, she  couldn't enroll with an employer. She made too much to qualify for  Medicaid but not enough to afford $400 monthly premiums. She was  uninsured from December to March and had to ration her insulin, putting  her life at risk. It was only when the pandemic started and she lost  all of her income that she was able to qualify for the essential plan  in New York's ACA marketplace and access her life-sustaining  medication. If the ACA is repealed, Allie will have nowhere to turn.  She is not alone. My friend Kyle lives with Down syndrome. His father  Bill has multiple preexisting conditions. Right now, Bill works part  time in order to help Kyle, who needs to be with somebody 24/7. They  are worried about cuts to Medicaid, which could affect the job-coaching  Kyle receives at the pizza parlor where he works, and about the repeal  of the ACA, which provides them the only care they can afford.  Rushing to seat this nominee means rushing to put Allie's life and  Kyle's life and millions of Americans in danger. My colleagues are  putting them all at risk only to further a very conservative agenda. It  is extreme.  Their agenda is to seat a nominee who has called Roe v. Wade  ``barbaric,'' when nearly 8 in 10 Americans believe that it is a  fundamental, human, and civil right for women to make decisions about  their bodies, including when or if or under what circumstances they  will have children; a nominee who referred to sexual orientation as a  preference--language that is not just outdated but truly harmful when  two in three Americans believe love is love, believe in marriage  equality, believe in the right to marry the person they love; a nominee  who refused to admit climate change is settled science and not a  controversial issue, when 99 percent of scientists and 81 percent of  Americans believe that humans are drivers of global warming.  So whose views does she represent? Certainly not those of the people  who sent us here. They believe in access to reproductive care. They  believe in equal rights for the LGBTQ community. They believe in  science. They believe that this seat should be filled by the next  President and confirmed by the next Senate. They have made it clear and  don't want the process of a lifetime appointment rushed.  This is the wrong judge for this seat, and this is the wrong process  for a lifetime appointment. It is hypocritical. It is dangerous. It is  not what the American people want.  I ask my colleagues to stop ignoring the people who sent us here and  to remember that it is our job to look out for their best interests--no  one else's. If we don't do that, we don't have the right to be here at  all.  I also want to express my condolences to the families and loved ones  who have experienced the human toll of the coronavirus pandemic. Over  220,000 Americans have died, and millions of others have been changed  forever. I am going to read some of the names of the people we have  lost. The [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6531\">Page S6531</a>, ] families of these individuals have given permission for their names to  be read on the Senate floor, adding them and their stories to the  Congressional Record:  Mark Anthony Urquiza, Paul Osterman, Frederick Harold Quinn, Richard  Rosenberg, Charles Mahoney, Felix Chidinma Oruh, Margaret R. Hogan,  Mahmooda Shaheen, Alan Kaplan, William W. Boyd, Breda C. Meadows, Jose  Morales Ramirez, David Benfield, John A. Alexiades, Michael F. Hughes,  Bob McDonald, Richard Proia, Rashonne Smith, Jose ``Joe'' Ramirez,  Steve Petras, Sr., Fareeda Kadwani, Jean Yettito, Abby Spitzer, Robert  ``Bobby'' McCoskey, Jose A. Matias, Erick B. Chavez, Anastasia  Koiveroglou, Shafqat Rasul Khan, Lynette Scullen and Joan Scullen,  Marue Santini, Buck McKinney, Christina Danielo, Cal Schoenfeld, Gregg  Pappadake, Sarah ``Sally'' Bielen, Rolando Castillo, Nais Coque, David  Tashman, Joseph LoBianco, Ramash Quasba, Edward Alonzo.  I would also like to share some concerns of the people of New York  over what a future without the Affordable Care Act would look like.  While my colleagues try to rush this confirmation so Judge Barrett  can be seated in time to rule on a case that could cause millions of  Americans to lose access to their healthcare, I think it is important  that we remember how that case will affect the people we are here to  serve.  In New York, there are more than 8 million people with preexisting  conditions who could face higher costs, fewer benefits, and more  trouble finding the coverage they need if the ACA is repealed. There  are more than 3 million people who could be denied coverage altogether  over preexisting conditions that are deemed uninsurable. There are more  than 470,000 people who have been diagnosed with COVID, each of whom  could find themselves paying higher premiums for worse coverage.  My mailbox has been flooded with letters from New Yorkers who are  cancer survivors and parents and people with disabilities who are all  worried about their families not being able to access the care that  they need. Working to take away their care, especially in the middle of  a pandemic, is inhumane.  Jane from West Islip wrote:  As a cancer survivor, I am very concerned about healthcare   and pre-existing conditions. We're facing a healthcare   meltdown. This next Justice could be the deciding vote that   determines whether health care for tens of millions of   people, protections for pre-existing conditions, and other   provisions of the ACA that benefit almost everyone, will stay   or go. Judge Barrett's documented hostility towards the ACA   disqualifies her from a lifetime appointment to the Supreme   Court. A vote for Judge Barrett is a vote to end healthcare.   Oppose her nomination.  Jane is not alone in her concerns.  Candice from Brooklyn wrote:  I am writing to urge you to oppose the nomination of Judge   Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. I am worried that   Judge Barrett's statements on the Affordable Care Act mean   that, if confirmed, she would vote to overturn the ACA.   Millions of Americans with disabilities rely on the ACA to   protect our right to healthcare. If the ACA is overturned,   especially during a pandemic, millions of lives could be at   risk.  This is a concern I have heard over and over and over and over again.  Meredith from New York City wrote to me about Stacy Staggs, the  mother of two young children who both have complex medical needs and  disabilities, who shared powerful testimony during the Supreme Court  confirmation hearings.  Meredith wrote:  When she spoke, she spoke for me. The ACA and disability   rights are at stake. This confirmation should wait until   after the American people have chosen who should pick the   next justice.  Parents across the State are also worried about what the Court with  Justice Barrett would mean for their children.  Susan from Amherst wrote to me about her daughter. She wrote:  My daughter is an amazing young woman--and a lesbian--and   an individual with preexisting conditions. Her depression has   worsened because she sees what a confirmation of Amy Coney   Barrett's confirmation would mean to her and many of her   friends. Even Pope Francis believes members of the LGBTQ+   community deserve to be part of a family and should be able   to participate in civil unions. Please help! She needs to   have hope! The rush to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the   Supreme Court is concerning. Not only have Senators not had   enough time to duly vet her, but we are in the middle of a   highly consequential election in which millions have already   cast their ballots. Further, Judge Barrett's LGBTQ rights   record suggests she cannot be an impartial jurist on these   matters. I'm deeply concerned about the future of rights for   the LGBTQ community.  These letters also send dire reminders of what life was like for too  many New Yorkers before the Affordable Care Act--a history we should  never repeat.  Jan from Ridgewood wrote:  I am 61 years old and have been self-employed for most of   my working life. This circumstance has made me a healthcare   voter! For decades I thought I was the only one complaining   about impossibly high health care costs. The cheapest plan   that I could find had a monthly premium of $692. For me as an   individual, with my husband--[who was] also self-employed--  and daughter it was about 1,250. After my divorce, I went   job-hunting for health insurance. I was willing to work for   free if I could be put on a health insurance plan. I didn't   find any.  The ACA put an end to that demeaning search. My income   fluctuates, so my premium goes up-and-down, but it has never   been as expensive as it was before ObamaCare. There is ample   evidence to suggest that Judge Barrett would overturn the   Affordable Care Act. Confirming such a justice during what is   perhaps the worst public health crisis in American history,   and while the Senate refuses to act to address the   coronavirus economic and health crisis, is unconscionable.  Let me say that again: Healthcare is so important that she was  willing to work for free just to have it. That is what is on the line  here.  Repealing the ACA would also mean an end to the rules preventing  insurance companies from charging women higher premiums than men and  requiring them to cover essential health benefits for women. That means  women would not only have to pay more, but it would also be harder for  the more than 4 million New York women who are covered by private  insurance to find coverage for maternity care, contraception, and cost- free screenings for breast cancer, cervical cancer, and bone density.  It would return us to the days when uninsured women could be denied  coverage altogether if they are pregnant or have a health problem.  It would also put our older adults at risk. Striking down the ACA  would reopen the prescription drug coverage cap--the so-called doughnut  hole--and could leave nearly 350,000 seniors in our State paying  thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs for the medications they  need.  Thomas is one of those seniors. He writes:  The price for the family insurance is high and with our   present administration will go higher and millions of   Americans will not be able to have insurance. And this is the   time it is needed with the lack of the virus control. Many   Americans are out of work and will never be able to get a job   that paid as much as the previous job. . . . Many Americans   have died because the administration would not treat the   virus when it was starting. Many homes now have less people   bringing in money to pay bills because of this. The   administration has no plan to replace ObamaCare. . . . And   with the second and third round of virus and flu, many more   may die. . . . Seniors are on a fixed income and seldom get   any breaks when it comes to bills. Part D of Medicare   prescriptions really went up this year. At the end of the   year, we fall in the doughnut hole and have to pay two to   three or more times for our medicine than we were paying. And   then at the beginning of the year, we must pay the deductible   which, on the average, is 400 plus dollars. But remember we   are on a fixed income, so that means going without something   else. Again, a zero-deductible plan does not cover much   unless you pay above 70 dollars a month. Do not expect the   average American to have much extra money. A lot of people   live on Social Security alone, and the present administration   wants to stop that income.  The American people do not want to lose their healthcare, not in the  middle of a pandemic, not ever, and they certainly don't believe we  should be prioritizing this nomination over providing them with real  relief.  Christine from Beacon wrote:  I find it appalling and horrific that instead of a humane   relief bill for the people who have lost family members,   jobs, homes, the stability of their children's shelter, food   security and education--not to mention the social cost of   interrupting normal childhood social development and just the   terrible grief and fear [people are dealing with] . . . that   instead of working on a relief bill, we have another judge   infuriatingly and unfairly jammed in to the court. The   Supreme Court! My god . . . the lack of respect and audacity   of beginning this process. There is wrong and right. And to   quote a great patriot: ``This is America. And here, right   matters.'' [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6532\">Page S6532</a>, ]  Christine is right. Doing the right thing for the American people  matters. It is actually our job. New Yorkers and people across this  country who have lost their jobs and their employer-based healthcare  are calling on the Senate to provide them with the relief they need to  survive this health and economic crisis.  Instead, the Republicans are pouring salt in their wounds by rushing  this process in order to eliminate the Medicaid expansions and  marketplaces these newly jobless Americans have turned to for coverage.  Overturning the ACA would immediately end the Medicaid coverage nearly  1.9 million beneficiaries in New York are relying on.  These stories I have shared represent the fears and concerns of the  people who sent us here to represent them. They are people with  debilitating illnesses, parents who are worried about sick children,  adults who are worried about elderly parents, and young men and women  who live with conditions like diabetes and are already struggling to  find insurance that will help them access the insulin they need.  They are struggling, and it is our job to get them the help they  need. The American people oppose this nomination. They are watching,  and one way or another, they will be heard.  I would like to read from an article in the New York Times by Reed  Abelson and Abby Goodnough, entitled: ``If the Supreme Court Ends  ObamaCare, Here's What It Would Mean.''  ``The Affordable Care Act touches the lives of most Americans, and  its abolition could have a significant effect on many millions more  people than those who get their health coverage through it.  What would happen if the Supreme Court struck down the Affordable  Care Act?  The fate of the sprawling, decade-old health law known as Obamacare  was already in question, with the high court expected to hear arguments  a week after the presidential election in the latest case seeking to  overturn it. But now, the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg  increases the possibility that the court could abolish it, even as  millions of people are losing job-based health coverage during the  coronavirus pandemic.  A federal judge in Texas invalidated the entire law in 2018. The  Trump administration, which had initially supported eliminating only  some parts of the law, then changed its position and agreed with the  judge's ruling. Earlier this year the Supreme Court agreed to take the  case.  Mr. Trump has vowed to replace Justice Ginsburg, a stalwart defender  of the law, before the election. If he is successful in placing a sixth  conservative on the court, its new composition could provide the  necessary five votes to uphold the Texas decision.  Many millions more people would be affected by such a ruling than  those who rely on the law for health insurance. Its many provisions  touch the lives of most Americans, from nursing mothers to people who  eat at chain restaurants.  Here are some potential consequences, based on estimates by various  groups.  133 Million  [' [', <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6532\">Page S6532</a>,   Americans with protected pre-existing conditions  As many as 133 million Americans--roughly half the population under  the age of 65--have pre-existing medical conditions that could  disqualify them from buying a health insurance policy or cause them to  pay significantly higher premiums if the health law were overturned,  according to a government analysis done in 2017. An existing medical  condition includes such common ailments as high blood pressure or  asthma, any of which could require those buying insurance on their own  to pay much more for a policy, if they could get one at all.  The coronavirus, which has infected nearly seven million Americans to  date and may have long-term health implications for many of those who  become ill, could also become one of the many medical histories that  would make it challenging for someone to find insurance.  Under the A.C.A., no one can be denied coverage under any  circumstance, and insurance companies cannot retroactively cancel a  policy unless they find evidence of fraud. The Kaiser Family Foundation  estimated that 54 million people have conditions serious enough that  insurers would outright deny them coverage if the A.C.A. were not in  effect, according to an analysis it did in 2019. Its estimates are  based on the guidelines insurers had in place about whom to cover  before the law was enacted.  Most Americans would still be able to get coverage under a plan  provided by an employer or under a federal program, as they did before  the law was passed, but protections for pre-existing conditions are  particularly important during an economic downturn or to those who want  to start their own businesses or retire early. Before the A.C.A.,  employers would sometimes refuse to cover certain conditions. If the  law went away, companies would have to decide if they would drop any of  the conditions they are now required to cover.  The need to protect people with existing medical conditions from  discrimination by insurers was a central theme in the 2018 midterm  elections, and Democrats attributed much of their success in reclaiming  control of the House of Representatives to voters' desire to safeguard  those protections. Mr. Trump and many Republicans promise to keep this  provision of the law, but have not said how they would do that. Before  the law, some individuals were sent to high-risk pools operated by  states, but even that coverage was often inadequate.  21 Million  [' [', <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6532\">Page S6532</a>,   People who could lose their health insurance  Of the 23 million people who either buy health insurance through the  marketplaces set up by the law (roughly 11 million) or receive coverage  through the expansion of Medicaid (12 million), about 21 million are at  serious risk of becoming uninsured if Obamacare is struck down. That  includes more than nine million who receive federal subsidies.  On average, the subsidies cover $492 of a $576 monthly premium this  year, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human  Services. If the marketplaces and subsidies go away, a comprehensive  health plan would become unaffordable for most of those people and many  of them would become uninsured.  States could not possibly replace the full amount of federal  subsidies with state funds.  12 Million  [' [', <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6532\">Page S6532</a>,   Adults who could lose Medicaid coverage  Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor that is  jointly funded by the federal government and the states, has been the  workhorse of Obamacare. If the health law were struck down, more than  12 million low-income adults who have gained Medicaid coverage through  the law's expansion of the program could lose it.  In all, according to the Urban Institute, enrollment in the program  would drop by more than 15 million, including roughly three million  children who got Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program  when their parents signed up for coverage.  The law ensures that states will never have to pay more than 10  percent of costs for their expanded Medicaid population; few if any  states would be able to pick up the remaining 90 percent to keep their  programs going. Over all, the federal government's tab was $66 billion  last year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.  Losing free health insurance would, of course, also mean worse access  to care and, quite possibly, worse health for the millions who would be  affected. Among other things, studies have found that Medicaid  expansion has led to better access to preventive screenings,  medications and mental health services.  800,000  [' [', Pages S6532-S6533,   People with opioid addiction getting treatment through Medicaid  The health law took effect just as the opioid epidemic was spreading  to all corners of the country, and health officials in many states say  that one of its biggest benefits has been providing access to addiction  treatment. It requires insurance companies to cover substance abuse  treatment, and they could stop if the law were struck down.  The biggest group able to get access to addiction treatment under the  law is adults who have gained Medicaid coverage. The Kaiser Family  Foundation [[', <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6533\">Page S6533</a>, ] estimated that 40 percent of people from 18 to 65 with opioid  addiction--roughly 800,000--are on Medicaid, many or most of whom  became eligible for it through the health law. Kaiser also found that  in 2016, Americans with Medicaid coverage were twice as likely as those  with no insurance to receive any treatment for addiction.  States with expanded Medicaid are spending much more on medications  that treat opioid addiction than they used to. From 2013 through 2017,  Medicaid spending on prescriptions for two medications that treat  opioid addiction more than doubled: It reached $887 million, up from  nearly $358 million in 2013, according to the Urban Institute.  The growing insured population in many states has also drawn more  treatment providers, including methadone clinics, inpatient programs  and primary care doctors who prescribe two other anti-craving  medications, buprenorphine and naltrexone. These significant expansions  of addiction care could shrink if the law were struck down, leaving a  handful of federal grant programs as the main sources of funds.  165 Million  [' [', <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6533\">Page S6533</a>,   Americans who no longer face caps on expensive treatments  The law protects many Americans from caps that insurers and employers  once used to limit how much they had to pay out in coverage each year  or over a lifetime. Among them are those who get coverage through an  employer--more than 150 million before the pandemic caused widespread  job loss--as well as roughly 15 million enrolled in Obamacare and other  plans in the individual insurance market.  Before the A.C.A., people with conditions like cancer or hemophilia  that were very expensive to treat often faced enormous out-of-pocket  costs once their medical bills reached these caps.  While not all health coverage was capped, most companies had some  sort of limit in place in 2009. A 2017 Brookings analysis estimated  that 109 million people would face lifetime limits on their coverage  without the health law, with some companies saying they would cover no  more than $1 million in medical bills per employee. The vast majority  of people never hit those limits, but some who did were forced into  bankruptcy or went without treatment.  60 Million Medicare beneficiaries would face changes to medical care and possibly   higher premiums  About 60 million people are covered under Medicare, the federal  health insurance program for people 65 and older and people of all ages  with disabilities. Even though the main aim of the A.C.A. was to  overhaul the health insurance markets, the law ``touches virtually  every part of Medicare,'' said Tricia Neuman, a senior vice president  for the Kaiser Family Foundation, which did an analysis of the law's  repeal. Overturning the law would be ``very disruptive,'' she said.  If the A.C.A. is struck down, Medicare beneficiaries would have to  pay more for preventive care, like a wellness visit or diabetes check,  which are now free. They would also have to pay more toward their  prescription drugs. About five million people faced the so-called  Medicare doughnut hole, or coverage gap, in 2016, which the A.C.A.  sought to eliminate. If the law were overturned, that coverage gap  would widen again.  The law also made other changes, like cutting the amount the federal  government paid hospitals and other providers as well as private  Medicare Advantage plans. Undoing the cuts could increase the program's  overall costs by hundreds of billions of dollars, according to Ms.  Neuman. Premiums under the program could go up as a result.  The A.C.A. was also responsible for promoting experiments into new  ways of paying hospitals and doctors, creating vehicles like  accountable care organizations to help hospitals, doctors and others to  better coordinate patients' care.  If the groups save Medicare money on the care they provide, they get  to keep some of those savings. About 11 million people are now enrolled  in these Medicare groups, and it is unclear what would happen to these  experiments if the law were deemed unconstitutional. Some of Mr.  Trump's initiatives, like the efforts to lower drug prices, would also  be hindered without the federal authority established under the A.C.A.  Repealing the law would also eliminate a 0.9 percent increase in the  payroll tax for high earners, which would mean less money coming into  the Medicare trust fund. The fund is already heading toward  insolvency--partly because other taxes created by the law that had  provided revenue for the fund have already been repealed--by 2024.  2 Million  [' [', <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6533\">Page S6533</a>,   Young adults with coverage through their parents' plans  The A.C.A. required employers to cover their employees' children  under the age of 26, and it is one of the law's most popular  provisions. Roughly two million young adults are covered under a  parent's insurance plan, according to a 2016 government estimate. If  the law were struck down, employers would have to decide if they would  continue to offer the coverage. Dorian Smith, a partner at Mercer, a  benefits consulting firm, predicted that many companies would most  likely continue.  $50 Billion  [' [', Pages S6533-S6554,   Medical care for the uninsured could cost billions more  Doctors and hospitals could lose a crucial source of revenue, as more  people lose insurance during an economic downturn. The Urban Institute  estimated that nationwide, without the A.C.A., the cost of care for  people who cannot pay for it could increase as much as $50.2 billion.  Hospitals and other medical providers, many of whom are already  struggling financially because of the pandemic, would incur losses, as  many now have higher revenues and reduced costs for uncompensated care  in states that expanded Medicaid. A study in 2017 by the Commonwealth  Fund found that for every dollar of uncompensated care costs those  states had in 2013, the health law had erased 40 cents by 2015, or a  total of $6.2 billion.  The health insurance industry would be upended by the elimination of  A.C.A. requirements. Insurers in many markets could again deny coverage  or charge higher premiums to people with pre-existing medical  conditions, and they could charge women higher rates. States could  still regulate insurance, but consumers would see more variation from  state to state. Insurers would also probably see lower revenues and  fewer members in the plans they operate in the individual market and  for state Medicaid programs at a time when millions of people are  losing their job-based coverage.  1,000 Calories Menu labels are among dozens of the law's provisions that are less well   known  The A.C.A. requires nutrition labeling and calorie counts on menu  items at chain restaurants.  It requires many employers to provide ``reasonable break time'' and a  private space for nursing mothers to pump breast milk.  It created a pathway for federal approval of biosimilars, which are  near-copies of biologic drugs, made from living cells.  These and other measures would have no legal mandate to continue if  the A.C.A. is eliminated.''  The ACA has made significant progress in the ability to expand  women's access to health care. Pushing for its repeal means putting  that progress and women's futures at risk.  I would like to read an article by Jamille Fields Allsbrook from the  Center for American Progress entitled ``Repealing the ACA During the  Coronavirus Pandemic Would Be Devastating for Women's Health and  Economic Security.''  It reads:  The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been one of the most   significant advancements for women's health and economic   security in a generation. The law expanded coverage to   millions of uninsured people through financial assistance and   public insurance and also improved the quality of existing   coverage, including by expanding access to reproductive and   maternal health services and by prohibiting discrimination   against women and people with preexisting conditions. Yet its   fate remains uncertain. On November 10, the U.S. Supreme   Court will hear oral arguments in California v. Texas, a case   that will determine the constitutionality of the ACA.   Specifically, the high court will determine whether the   individual mandate is unconstitutional and whether the   remainder of the law is inseverable from that provision.   Especially with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recent passing,   the benefits and consumer protections that women have gained   and [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6534\">Page S6534</a>, ]  come to rely on could swiftly be eliminated. In short, if the   ACA is repealed, coverage for more than 20 million people and   the significant benefits and consumer protections that have   been gained under that law are at stake.  Compounding this issue, the ACA repeal would come at a time   when the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic crisis   have already burdened women. For instance, unprecedented job   losses have resulted in the loss of insurance coverage;   barriers to maternal and reproductive health care have been   erected; the providers women rely on--who were already   underfunded--have been stretched to capacity; and health   disparities that have historically burdened Black and Latina   women have been exacerbated and compounded. Repealing the ACA   during the pandemic would no doubt cost women--especially   women of color, women with disabilities, women with low   incomes, and young women.  First, repealing the ACA would reduce access to treatments   and vaccines during the pandemic and allow COVID-19 survivors   to be discriminated against in the insurance market, thus   lengthening the time that the crisis will likely affect women   and their families. Second, the economic crisis has already   harmed women the most, and eliminating coverage and allowing   gender rating and coverage caps would shift additional costs   on to women. Lastly, existing barriers to maternal and   reproductive health services, both those created during and   before the pandemic, would likely be exacerbated. 1. Repealing the ACA would prolong and worsen the effects of the   pandemic for women and their families.  While a repeal of the ACA would be chaotic and devastating   even in typical times, the current pandemic would only   magnify its effects. Without coverage, women would experience   barriers to a COVID-19 treatment and vaccine--which could   prolong the effects of the pandemic. These barriers would be   most devastating, however, for women of color given the   health inequities associated with COVID-19. Compared with   white, non-Hispanic people, Black people are 2.6 times more   likely to contract the virus, 4.7 times more likely to be   hospitalized, and 2.1 times more likely to die from the   disease. Similarly, American Indian and Alaska Native people   contract the virus at 2.8 times the rate, are hospitalized at   5.3 times the rate, and die at 1.4 times the rate of white,   non-Hispanic people. And Latinx people are 2.8 times more   likely to contract the virus, 4.6 times more likely to be   hospitalized, and 1.1 times more likely to die of COVID-19   than white, non-Hispanic people.  Even worse, if the ACA is repealed, COVID-19 survivors   could be discriminated against when seeking insurance   coverage. Without ACA protections, insurers in the individual   market could once again charge enrollees more or deny them   coverage if they have a preexisting condition. This could   affect the more than 7 million Americans who have been   infected with COVID-19, as it could be deemed a preexisting   condition.  Even before the pandemic, a Center for American Progress   analysis found that nearly 68 million women--more than half   of girls and nonelderly women in the country--had a   preexisting condition. If insurers are able to make the   determination as to whether a person has a preexisting   condition, conditions ranging from HIV/AIDS to breast cancer   to the nearly 6 million annual pregnancies could again be   included in this category. And importantly, Black, Latinx and   American Indian and Alaska Native people have higher rates of   COVID-19 as well as certain chronic conditions such as   cervical cancer and diabetes, so eliminating coverage and   protections for people with preexisting conditions would harm   these communities the most.  2. Women's financial security would be threatened by an ACA   repeal.  Women have lost the majority of jobs since the start of the   pandemic. In fact, multiple studies have pointed to the fact   that the current recession is tougher on women than men. One   U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics explains that unlike past   recessions, ``the [coronavirus] crisis has battered industry   sectors in which women's employment is more concentrated--  restaurants and other retail establishments, hospitality and   health care.'' Additionally, school closures have forced   women, who are more likely to be primary caregivers for young   children or sick family members, to reduce hours or leave   their jobs--which can also result in coverage loses. In   particular, Black and Latina mothers are more likely than   white mothers to be the sole or primary breadwinners of their   households, so they will be hit hardest by the additional   financial burdens. Before the pandemic, there was already a   wage gap between women and men--a gap that is exacerbated by   race and ethnicity, given that Black, Latinx, and American   Indian and Alaskan Native populations experience poverty   rates that are significantly higher than those of non-  Hispanic, white populations. Perhaps as a result, women were   already more likely than men to forgo or delay accessing   recommended care due to costs.  Yet given the pandemic, losing the financial security   afforded by having insurance coverage would be even more   devastating for women. The ACA provided financial assistance   for private insurance coverage and expanded enrollment in the   Medicaid program, which resulted in the uninsurance rate   reaching a historic low. As a result, the uninsurance rate   among women declined by nearly half from 2010 to 2016. An ACA   repeal would merely undermine safety net programs when people   need them the most. Women comprise 58 percent of Medicaid   enrollees according to 2018 data, and Medicaid expansion   resulted in a 13-percent decrease in the uninsurance rate   of young women of reproductive age--19 to 44 years old--  with low incomes. In particular, Medicaid's no- and low-  cost services afford necessary and preventive health care   access to people with low incomes, a disproportionate   number of whom are women of color due to systemic racism,   sexism, and poverty. From 2013 to 2018, due to the ACA's   coverage expansions, fewer Black women and Latinas   reported delaying care as a result of costs, narrowing the   disparity between white women and women of color.  Women who maintain access to insurance coverage could also   face increased costs. If the ACA's prohibition on gender   rating is repealed, insurers could once again charge women   more for coverage in the individual and small-group markets   simply for being women, reinstating a practice that   collectively cost women $1 billion more than men each year.   Additionally, the ACA created the Health Care Rights Law,   which prohibits discrimination in health care on the basis of   sex, race, color, national origin, age, and disability;   notably, this marks the first time that a federal prohibition   against sex discrimination was applied broadly to health   care. Lastly, if the health care law is repealed, women with   chronic conditions, such as HIV and cancer, could be subject   to annual lifetime limits--a practice prohibited under the   ACA that allowed insurers to require plan enrollees pay out   of pocket for all services after they reach a certain dollar   threshold. These increased costs could easily price many   women out of insurance in the middle of a public health   crisis.  The ACA has also been associated with improving job   opportunities. The majority of people in the United States   access health coverage through their employer, yet by   improving access to coverage that is not job-based, the ACA   has afforded people the ability to leave or switch jobs with   assurance that they won't lose the coverage. Moreover, the   ACA created at least 240,000 jobs in the health care industry   from 2014 to 2016--and women comprise the majority of health   care workers. The chaos that would result from repealing the   ACA would be felt particularly acutely by those employed in   these jobs.  3. Repealing the ACA would exacerbate existing barriers to   reproductive and maternal health care services.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and   Prevention, pregnant people with COVID-19 have higher rates   of hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit, and   mechanical ventilation. And alarmingly, Black pregnant women   are disproportionately contracting COVID-19. Subsequently,   there are concerns that the pandemic will exacerbate existing   health inequities that have led to Black, as well as American   Indian and Alaska Native women, dying from pregnancy-related   complications at around three times the rate of white, non-  Hispanic women. A repeal of the ACA in its entirety would   result in reduced access to pre- and post-natal care for as   many as 13 million people in the individual market because   the individual and small-group health plans would no longer   be required to cover certain basic health care services--  known as essential health benefits--including maternity and   newborn care. Eliminating the expanded eligibility created   under the ACA could also worsen the crisis given that   Medicaid expansion is associated with lower rates of maternal   and infant mortality and covers 50 percent of births in the   United States.  Moreover, due to the many unknowns that remain regarding   how COVID-19 affects pregnant people, some individuals may   want to delay or forgo pregnancy, necessitating access to   comprehensive reproductive health services. The ACA requires   most plans to cover birth control with no out-of-pocket   costs. As a result, women have saved more than $1.4 billion a   year in out-of-pocket costs on birth control pills. According   to data from the National Women's Law Center, 61.4 million   women currently have access to birth control as well as other   preventive services, such as well-woman visits, with no out-  of-pocket costs--thanks to the ACA. Without requirements for   those services to be covered, women would be forced to pay   out of pocket or forgo care if they could not afford to.   Illustratively, without insurance coverage, birth control   pills would cost a woman up to $600 per year, and an   intrauterine device would cost about $1,000 out of pocket.  Additionally, the pandemic has erected barriers that make   it harder for women to access necessary preventive care--both   as a result of job losses and barriers to accessing care   during the pandemic. As a result, women have already delayed   care in recent months. A repeal of the ACA would only lead to   further delays given that plans would no longer be required   to cover preventive screenings, mental and substance abuse   services, rehabilitative services, and a host of other   services.  President Donald Trump and his conservative allies in the   Senate are not only forgoing their responsibility to address   the dueling health and economic crises, they are also rushing   to install a new, conservative justice on the Supreme Court   who would tilt its balance in favor of striking down the ACA.   With November oral arguments quickly approaching, this has   increased the risk [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6535\">Page S6535</a>, ]  that the health care law will be repealed. Given the health   benefits, protections against discrimination, and financial   security that the ACA affords women, destroying the law would   be immeasurably harmful to women at any time. But repealing   the law in the midst of a global pandemic that has infected   millions of Americas and killed more than 200,000 people in   the United States would result in even more chaos and   devastation.  One of the newest groups of people with preexisting conditions who  are worried about losing or being able to afford coverage are the COVID  long-haulers. I would like to read this article from PEW Stateline,  written by Michael Ollove, entitled ``COVID-19 `Long-Haulers' Worry  About Coverage Costs.''  It reads:  Andrea Ceresa has been through three gastroenterologists   already and now is moving on to her fourth.  She's seen an infectious disease specialist, a   hematologist, cardiologist, an ear, nose and throat   specialist, a physiatrist and an integrative doctor. She has   an appointment coming up with a neuropsychologist and another   one with a neurologist. She had an endoscopy, colonoscopy, CT   scan, brain MRI, and so many blood tests, she said ``I   feel like a human pin cushion.'' She was planning a trip   soon to an acupuncturist and has a referral for   occupational therapy.  Ceresa, a resident of Branchburg, NJ, relayed this medical litany on  day 164 of her COVID-19 ordeal. So far, she said, nothing much has  helped.  Before COVID-19, Ceresa was a healthy, active 46-year-old who managed  a dental office by day and sang professionally by night, a woman who  enjoyed yoga and jumped on a WaveRunner any chance she got. Now, beset  by a multitude of unshakable symptoms, she said COVID-19 has  transformed her into a ``shell'' of what she was. All parts of her body  are in rebellion. She has severe, persistent diarrhea, constant nausea,  dizziness, paralyzing fatigue, piercing headaches, numbness in her  limbs, blurry vision, ringing in her ears, and a loss of hearing, an  insurmountable deficit for a musician. She gets a rash on her face,  finds light and Sun painful on her eyes--a condition known as  photophobia--and suddenly finds herself feeling uncomfortably cold for  no reason. On top of all that is an alarming brain fog.  ``At some point in this conversation,'' she warned, ``I might lose my  train of thought or forget words.''  When this will end--if it will end--none of those doctors and  specialists can tell her, nor can anyone else, not at the Federal  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of  Health, the World Health Organization or any other major health  organization. As a result, Ceresa has no idea what life holds for her.  So-called long-haulers like Ceresa pose policy questions that have  yet to command much public attention but daily become more pressing for  those with lingering problems. Unable to work, will they have access to  health insurance, especially if the Trump administration succeeds in  overturning the Affordable Care Act. Will Medicaid be available to  them? Will the Federal Government invest in research and treatment?  Will they be eligible for disability benefits?  Advocates say it is essential to begin grappling with these questions  now as it becomes increasingly clear that for many being ill with  COVID-19 is not a transitory experience.  ``As time goes on and infection rates go up, the fallout is an  extraordinary number of people who were previously healthy, working,  and engaged in the economy will now become shadows of their former  selves,'' said Diana Berrent, founder of Survivor Corps, a grassroots  organization connecting those who have been infected with COVID-19.  Berrent said it has 107,000 members.  ``People are aging decades in the course of months,'' said Berrent,  who is still experiencing symptoms months after her positive test.  ``People in their 20s are suffering heart attacks and strokes months  after their moderate or even mild COVID experiences.''  More attention needs to be paid to those with persistent, serious  COVID-19 symptoms, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease doctor  and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health  Security.  In this pandemic so far we've thought mainly about the   metrics of deaths and hospitalizations, but now we must think   about people with long-haul symptoms. How will this affect   society as a whole? What happens if people don't go back to   their former level of activities?  For her part, Ceresa has no idea when or if she will be able to  return to work. She lost her employer-sponsored healthcare and recently  got on an ObamaCare policy. But, with uncertainty hanging over the ACA,  she wonders how long she will have it  ``I have a plethora of preexisting conditions that I never had  before,'' she said.  Meanwhile, hardly a day goes by that she doesn't have some kind of  medical appointment, including some at Mount Sinai Hospital in New  York, which opened what Berrent said is one of only two centers in the  United States specifically focused on those with ``long COVID-19.''  ``I'm doing everything you can imagine to try to get better,'' Ceresa  said. ``If someone says, `Try this,' I'll try. I'll walk on coals. The  list of referrals I have is off the charts.''  Exactly how many people fall into the category of long-haulers is  uncertain, which is part of the problem, Berrent said. There is very  little research yet on the experiences of people who suffer from  persistent COVID-19 symptoms.  ``Even if it's a small percentage of people with long-haul  symptoms,'' Adalja said, ``with more than seven million people infected  overall that's still going to be a big number.''  The CDC in late July reported that 35 percent of symptomatic adults  who had tested positive for COVID-19 said they had not returned to  their usual state of health 2 to 3 weeks after their tests. Among those  ages 18-34, 1 in 5 hadn't returned to their normal states of health.  The survey did not include children.  There appears to be no data yet on numbers of people experiencing  serious symptoms over longer periods of time or detailed information  about their circumstances, such as age, gender, medical histories, or  course of their illnesses. Complicating the data collection is that  many of them, even those with debilitating symptoms, were never  hospitalized.  Some researchers are delving into the subject, including Natalie  Lambert, a medical researcher at Indiana University School of Medicine,  who has partnered with Berrent's group to amass a far more extensive  list of COVID-19-related symptoms reported by long-haulers than the 11  symptoms CDC identifies. Lambert's survey lists 98. Respondents  characterize more than a quarter of those symptoms as painful.  Because so little is still known about COVID-19, Lambert said doctors  often dismiss patient concerns that their symptoms are virus related.  ``If a provider is updated, things move along and that patient has  access to best care,'' said Lambert. ``But if the provider is not up to  date or is skeptical that the symptoms are COVID-related, they might  think that it's just a case of reflux or anxiety. In those cases,  patients are stuck.''  Kelly Ausiello, a 42-year-old registered nurse in Hendersonville, NV,  has had a constellation of symptoms since April, including severe  migraines, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and weakness. Ausiello has  stopped going to doctors because none knew what to do for her.  ``They keep saying they don't know how to help me,'' she said. ``They  just say, `I don't know,' `I don't know,' `I don't know.' ''  She had to suspend her studies to become a nurse practitioner, which  she was on course to complete in December. She doesn't know if her  health will allow her to ever resume.  ``My life is changing maybe forever,'' she said.  Long-term COVID-19 raises several policy issues. For people affected,  none is more urgent than the threat of losing their health insurance.  The ACA, which passed in 2010, barred health insurers from denying  coverage to people with serious or chronic health conditions prior to  enrollment, adding significant surcharges to their premiums, curtailing  their benefits, or imposing extended waiting periods on them.  Such protections would vanish if the Supreme Court invalidates the  ACA, as the Trump administration and Republican Governors or attorney  generals in [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6536\">Page S6536</a>, ] 20 States are urging it to do. The Court is scheduled to hear arguments  in the case next month, possibly with a new, decisive, Trump-nominated  Justice on the bench.  A 2017 Federal study found that up to 133 million Americans under age  65 had preexisting conditions. COVID-19 could add substantial numbers  of people to that total.  Without the ACA's protections, people who had a positive test for  COVID-19 could be denied coverage. More than 7.5 million cases have  been reported in the United States. Because the virus has been linked  to damage to the heart, lungs, and brain, a positive COVID-19 test  could be used to argue that a patient had had a preexisting condition-- COVID-19--to refuse claims to a patient who later developed a disease  related to one of those organs.  But even those with negative tests could get caught in the same net,  according to a paper published late last month by the Kaiser Family  Foundation. The paper notes, for example, that rideshare drivers who  get tested because they worry they have been exposed could be refused  coverage if an insurer determines that those seeking tests have higher  odds of infection.  ``If ACA protections are invalidated, such people might be turned  down, charged more, or offered a policy that temporarily or permanently  excludes coverage for COVID-19,'' the paper said.  Karen Pollitz, one of the authors, described insurers as ruthless  when it came to medical underwriting in the days before the ACA.  ``The individual health insurance market pre-ACA was a competitive  market,'' she said. ``It did not pay for one insurer to be more  generous than another. It was a race to the bottom.''  Without explaining how they would do it without the ACA, President  Donald Trump and some congressional Republicans have promised they  would continue to protect those with preexisting conditions.  At least 17 States have adopted laws preserving preexisting condition  protections should the ACA be overturned, but the effectiveness of  those laws is questionable.  The ACA also helps stabilize health insurance premiums through  Federal tax credits it provides to low-income policyholders. Those  dollars would be eliminated without the ACA, probably putting health  insurance out of reach for many Americans, particularly those facing  high surcharges for preexisting conditions.  Even if some States tried to preserve the protections within their  borders, insurers could simply refuse to offer coverage to residents of  those states.  The elimination of the ACA also might scrap the Medicaid expansion  that was part of the law. That alone could deprive more than 12 million  low-income, adult Americans, some of them no doubt long-haulers, of  health insurance coverage.  The dearth of testing, especially early in the pandemic, could become  a problem for long-haulers if Congress eventually creates a fund to  help pay for COVID-19 treatment, as it eventually did for first  responders affected by their work at Ground Zero after 9/11.  ``People are going to need to prove they had COVID, but how do you do  that when tests weren't available or were faulty?'' said Berrent.  ``That's going to put people in a pickle.''  Without firm, black-and-white results, patients with lingering  symptoms could find it impossible to make their case that their  illnesses were coronavirus-related.  ``There may come a period in which people are going to have to prove  that COVID is the reason for their heart issue or lung disease and not  just that they're getting older,'' said Nathan Boucher, an assistant  research professor at Duke University's Sanford School of Public  Policy.  Berrent said many of those in her group complain of doctors not  believing them. ``People are being gaslit by doctors,'' she said. ``And  it's more women than men. I call it a modern-day version of what they  used to call female hysteria.''  Joy Wu, a 37-year-old engineer in the San Francisco Bay area, has had  firsthand experience with that medical skepticism. She contracted what  she believes was COVID-19 after returning in March from a vacation on  the Galapagos Islands.  She experienced dizziness, nausea, fatigue, back pain, confusion,  excruciating headaches, and such weakness that she has repeatedly  fallen. Sometimes her heart races so fast, she said, ``It feels like  it's going to explode.'' She has episodes of tingling in her limbs and  brain fog.  Because she didn't have the respiratory symptoms most often  associated with COVID-19, she didn't have a diagnostic test until day  43, too late to know if she was infected, as she thinks she was, weeks  earlier. She tested negative.  She said an ER doctor diagnosed her with COVID-19, although three  medical doctors have attributed her symptoms to anxiety. But Wu said  that both a psychiatrist and a psychologist who examined her told her  that mental illness doesn't explain her symptoms. It was through a  COVID-19 support Facebook group that she found others with similar  symptoms.  Apart from ensuring that long-haulers can get health insurance,  Berrent believes policymakers need to ensure that COVID-19 patients  will not be barred from receiving disability benefits. Many, such as  Ceresa and Wu, will not return to the workforce anytime soon.  ``Disability wasn't meant for people when they're 30 or 40, but  that's what we are going to be facing,'' she said.  Beyond finding a way to pay for COVID-19 treatment, Berrent said, the  Federal Government should invest heavily in understanding the medical  experience of long-haulers with an eye toward developing effective  treatments. She wants to see more post-COVID-19 centers established for  research and treatment.  ``We need a warp speed race for a therapeutic for people suffering  from post-COVID-19 that parallels what we're seeing for the development  of a vaccine,'' she said.''  The Affordable Care Act has helped millions of Americans access the  health coverage they need, and it has worked to address racial  disparities in health coverage. Overturning it threatens to undo that  progress.  I would like to read an article from the Kaiser Family Foundation by  Samantha Artiga, entitled ``Loss of the Affordable Care Act Would Widen  Racial Disparities in Health Coverage.''  It reads: ``In November, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear  arguments on a legal challenge, supported by the Trump administration,  that seeks to overturn the Affordable Care Act (ACA). As noted in a  previous KFF analysis, the outcome will have major effects throughout  the health care system as the law's provisions have affected nearly all  Americans in some way.  One of the most significant aspects of the ACA has been its expansion  of health coverage options through the Medicaid expansion to low-income  adults and the creation of the health insurance marketplaces with  subsidies to help people purchase coverage.  This analysis shows that these new coverage options have contributed  to large gains in coverage, particularly among people of color, helping  to narrow longstanding racial disparities in health coverage. The loss  of these coverage pathways, particularly the Medicaid expansion, would  likely lead to disproportionate coverage losses among people of color,  which would widen disparities in coverage, access to care, and health  outcomes.  Prior to the ACA, people of color were significantly more likely to  be uninsured than White people. The higher uninsured rates among groups  of color reflected limited access to affordable health coverage  options.  Although the majority of individuals have at least one full-time  worker in the family across racial and ethnic groups, people of color  are more likely to live in low-income families that do not have  coverage offered by an employer or to have difficulty affording private  coverage when it is available.  While Medicaid helped fill some of this gap in private coverage for  groups of color, before the ACA, Medicaid eligibility for parents was  limited to those with very low incomes (often below 50% of the poverty  level), and adults without dependent children--regardless of how poor-- were ineligible under federal rules.  People of color experienced large coverage gains under the ACA that  helped to narrow but did not eliminate disparities in health coverage.  Coverage [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6537\">Page S6537</a>, ] rates increased for all racial/ethnic groups between 2010 and 2016,  with the largest increases occurring after implementation of the ACA  Medicaid and Marketplace coverage expansions in 2014. Overall, nearly  20 million nonelderly people gained coverage over this period,  including nearly 3 million Black people, over 5 million Hispanic  people, and over 1 million Asian people.  Among the nonelderly population, Hispanic individuals had the largest  percentage point decrease in their uninsured rate, which fell from  32.6% to 19.1% between 2010 and 2016.  Black, Asian, American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN), and Native  Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI) people also had larger  percentage point decreases in their uninsured rates compared to their  White counterparts over that period. These coverage gains reduced  percentage point differences in uninsured rates between some groups of  color and White people, but disparities persisted.  Most groups of color remained more likely to be uninsured compared to  White people. Moreover, the relative risk of being uninsured compared  to White people did not improve for some groups. For example, Black  people remained 1.5 times more likely to be uninsured than White  people, and the uninsured rate among Hispanic people remained over 2.5  times higher than the rate for White people.  Between 2016 and 2017, and continuing in 2018, coverage gains stalled  and began reversing for some groups. Over this period there were small  but statistically significant increases in the uninsured rates for  White and Black people among the nonelderly population, which rose from  7.1% to 7.5% and from 10.7% to 11.5% respectively. Among children,  there was also a statistically significant increase in the uninsured  rate for Hispanic children, which rose from 7.6% to 8.0% between 2016  and 2018.  Recent data further show that the number of uninsured continued to  grow in 2019 despite improvements in household economic measures, and  indicate the largest increases between 2018 and 2019 were among  Hispanic people.  The growth in the uninsured likely reflects a combination of factors,  including rollback of outreach and enrollment efforts for ACA coverage,  changes to Medicaid renewal processes, public charge policies, and  elimination of the individual mandate penalty for health coverage.  The ACA provides coverage options for people losing jobs amid the  economic downturn associated with the pandemic. The economic fallout of  the coronavirus pandemic has led to historic levels of job loss. As  people lose jobs, many may face disruptions in their health coverage  since most people in the U.S. get their insurance through their job.  Early KFF estimates of the implications of job loss found that nearly  27 million people were at risk of losing employer-sponsored health  coverage due to job loss. Many of these people may have retained their  coverage, at least in the short term, under furlough agreements or  employers continuing benefits after layoffs. However, the health  coverage options made available through the ACA have provided options  for people losing employer-sponsored coverage who might otherwise  become uninsured.  Following enrollment declines in 2018 and 2019, recent data indicate  Medicaid enrollment increased by 2.3 million or 3.2% from February 2020  to May 2020. Additionally, as of May 2020, enrollment data reveal  nearly 500,000 people had gained Marketplace coverage through a special  enrollment period (SEP), in most cases due to the loss of job-based  coverage.  The number of people gaining Marketplace coverage through a SEP in  April 2020 was up 139% compared to April 2019 and up 43% in May 2020  compared to May 2019.  People of color would likely experience the largest coverage losses  if the ACA coverage options were eliminated. In the absence of the ACA,  states would lose a pathway to cover adults without dependent children  through Medicaid under federal rules. They also would lose access to  the enhanced federal funding provided to cover expansion adults.  As such, states would face challenges to maintain coverage for adults  without dependent children and parents and many would likely roll back  this coverage, eliminating a coverage option for millions of low-income  parents and childless adults who do not have access to other affordable  coverage.  Moreover, without the federal subsidies, many people would not be  able to afford private coverage. Since people of color experienced  larger gains in coverage under the ACA compared to their White  counterparts, they would likely also experience larger coverage losses  if these coverage options were eliminated.  Loss of the Medicaid expansion, in particular, would likely lead to  disproportionate coverage losses among people of color, contributing to  widening disparities in coverage, access to and use of care, and health  outcomes. Overall, among the nonelderly population, roughly one in  three Black, Hispanic, and AIAN people are covered by Medicaid compared  to 15% of White people.  Further, research shows that the ACA Medicaid expansion to low-income  adults has helped to narrow racial disparities in health coverage,  contributed to improvements in access to and use of care across groups,  and narrowed disparities in health outcomes for Black and Hispanic  individuals, particularly for measures of maternal health.  In sum, the outcome of the pending legal challenge to overturn the  ACA will have effects that extend broadly across the health care system  and touch nearly all Americans. These effects could include widening  racial disparities in health coverage and health care, at a time when  there is a growing focus on prioritizing and advancing health equity  and in the middle of a pandemic that has disproportionately affected  people of color in the U.S.  Without the ACA coverage expansions, people of color would likely  face widening gaps in health insurance coverage, which would contribute  to greater barriers to health care and worse health outcomes and leave  them at increased risk for medical debt and financial challenges due to  health care costs.''

Mr. President, I was necessarily absent, but had I been  present I would have voted yes on rollcall vote No. 240, motion to  invoke cloture on the nomination of Taylor B. McNeel, of Mississippi,  to be United States District Judge for the Southern District of  Mississippi    ", "Mr. PAUL": " Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise to honor the passing of a great Kentuckian, Richard Ronald Knock, or Dick, as he was known to his friends and family. He died December 8, 2020, at the age of 82. Dick was born June 28, 1938 in Cold Spring, KY. Dick's name was always mentioned with high praise. He was valued in his community, as he was known to lend a helping hand when needed and provided a thoughtful ear when spoken to. Mr. Knock came from a humble upbringing, but through his own deeds, he rose to the pinnacle of his profession, being a respected member of many institutions, including as CEO of Knock Investments; CEO of Omaha Enterprises; through his service on the Board of Trustees at University of the Cumberlands; and as chairman of Board of Commissioners for the Boone County Water District. Dick was also an active political pundit within his community. His commitment to freedom was unmatched, and he often proved to be a great source of wisdom for elected leaders such as myself. Dick worked tirelessly in bringing Republicans throughout the Commonwealth together in the name of freedom. I can recall during my first election he opened his house for an event that featured my predecessor, Senator Jim Bunning, that helped unify Republicans in a critical area of our State. A picture from that event hangs in my Washington office to this day. With his passing, we have lost one of our brightest and loudest freedom fighters, but, as Dick would want, the voices of liberty will remain loud and clear. While we share in the great sadness of his passing, it with great joy we look back at his life, his many accopmlishments, and the positive impact he had on his community and Kentuckians across the Commonwealth. We honor Dick and his family, and may he rest in peace.<bullet>   ", "Mr. JONES": " Mr. JONES. Mr. President, as I mentioned in my farewell speech last  week, I also wanted to spend a few final moments here on the Senate  floor honoring my incredible staff. As the first Democrat elected to  the Senate from Alabama in two decades, I had no idea how many  brilliant young folks would want to come work in my offices, but we  were absolutely overwhelmed with the talent my election attracted--and  not just from Alabama--we had applicants from all over the country. We  of course tried to give priority to folks from Alabama, but we did have  a few from other States who brought special expertise and who, after  just a short time with us, became honorary Alabamians.  Some of my staff came from other Senate or House offices where they  had been biding their time, hoping 1 day to work for an Alabama  Democratic Senator. Their experience was critical. Some staff members  brought no legislative experience at all, but they were quick and eager  learners and got up to speed unbelievably fast. What they all [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7937\">Page S7937</a>, ] had in common was a deep and sincere commitment to doing the right  thing for the right reasons.  There were very few shortcuts and very few easy decisions, but we all  worked hard to understand the issues backwards and forwards and to do  our best for the people of Alabama and for our country. Although each  member of the staff was acutely aware that I would have to stand for  reelection in just 3 short years, they were as committed as I was to  not let political considerations enter into our deliberations. Instead  we focused on the needs of our constituents, big and small, and doing  all we could to make sure those needs were met.  Over the past 3 years, we have become a family, and we have had some  fun to boot. Equally important, we have gotten things done. We led or  coled over 20 bipartisan bills that were signed into law. We mustered  enough support to finally repeal the Widow's Tax. We secured permanent  Federal funding for HBCUs and minority-serving institutions. We made  things easier for folks applying for Federal student loans. We secured  authorizations and appropriations for hundreds of millions of dollars  in funding for defense-related projects in Alabama. We set up a process  to collect and make available to the public the Federal records from  unsolved civil rights crimes. We completed 2,094 requests for casework  help and responded to hundreds of thousands of calls, letters, and  emails from Alabama constituents. We submitted 624 letters in support  of Alabamians' grant applications, resulting in $270,973,411 in awards  for municipalities, nonprofits, colleges and universities, rural fire  departments, health centers, and others. Out of the outstanding high  school seniors who I nominated to our military service academies, 44  have received appointments, and that is in just our first 2 years  alone; we won't know the results for 2020 until next spring. We did  more than 1,000 interviews, speeches, townhalls, and events across the  State of Alabama and in DC. None of these things, absolutely none of  them, would have been possible without the hard work and unflagging  dedication of my staff.  My time in the U.S. Senate was enhanced immeasurably by the tangible  and intangible contributions of my staff. As I said earlier, we knew we  only had 3 years guaranteed, and we made the most of it. From our  amazing record of legislative accomplishments, to our warm and  welcoming office culture, to our emphasis on bipartisanship and  collegiality, we made a positive difference, and I am immensely proud  to have served with each of them.  Although it is impossible to go through the contributions of each I  do want to single out a few who really made the office click or were  responsible in some way for a major accomplishment.  First is my chief of staff Dana Gresham. Dana came to me by way of  the House and then the Department of Transportation. He has always been  a leader, and for me, I was so proud to have him as the first African- American chief of staff for a Democratic Senator. He was instrumental  in building the staff and guiding the delicate nature of Beltway and  Alabama politics.  My legislative director Mark Libell brought a level of experience and  direction to our legislative team that I think is unmatched in the  Senate. He brought a level of skill to the legislative process that is  largely responsible for the many successes we had.  Katie Campbell doubled as the deputy legislative director and  legislative assistant on our healthcare related matters. She brought a  tremendous amount of knowledge and was thus a tremendous resource for  our healthcare agenda, which was always one of my top priorities.  On the Banking Committee, I was fortunate to have Mike Berman for a  couple of years before he moved into the private sector. Mike began the  painstaking process of revising the country's money laundering laws  which his successor on the staff, Lauren Oppenheimer, picked up. Thanks  to their combined efforts and working with colleagues and various  stakeholders and regulators, Congress passed as part of the NDAA an  update to our money laundering laws for the first time in decades.  My friend of 20 years Cissy Jackson came to Washington after  practicing law with me in Birmingham. She had no legislative experience  but soon became a rockstar among the Senate staff on both sides of the  aisle, first with the Homeland Security Committee and then as my MLA on  the Armed Services Committee. So much of what we were able to secure  for the people of Alabama in the NDAA is a direct result of Cissy's  tireless and persistent efforts.  Rebecca Howard handled education policy for me. Through her efforts,  we secured additional and permanent funding for HBCUs, as well as the  success in simplifying the FAFSA form, which will allow so many kids in  Alabama to receive a college education. She also coordinated the annual  HBCU symposiums that we conducted each year.  The director of my State staff was Brantley Fry. Brantley made sure  that I stayed incredibly busy when I was at home. We traveled from one  end of the State to the other. We visited businesses, military  installations, schools, and farms. She coordinated the townhalls and  roundtables, all with an eye to the important issues facing the State.  Heather Fluit was my communications director and she did tremendous  work keeping the people of Alabama up to speed on all the good work  that we were doing in Washington and around the State. This could be a  difficult job at times on weedy issues like money laundering, but  Heather excelled.  I could not conclude these remarks, however, without once again  noting what was one of my proudest moments in the Senate when we  successfully eliminated the Military Widow's Tax. It took a tremendous  amount of effort and persistence in making that legislation a reality,  and so much of the credit goes to Sarah Kate Sullivan in my office.  Like me and my colleague Senator Collins, Sarah Kate never gave up, and  today, so many military families will benefit from her efforts.  My wife Louise and I thank each of these individuals listed below  from the bottom of our hearts.

Based on press reports alone, the hackers appear to have breached the  Department of State, the Department of Commerce, the Department of  Energy, the Department of the Treasury, the National Nuclear Security  Agency, and the Department of Homeland Security--including the agency  responsible for our cyber security.  On top of that, the hackers also managed to breach major American  companies like Microsoft and compromised several State governments and  other foreign governments all at the same time in this process.  While we are learning more about these breaches, the level of  resources and sophistication bears all the hallmarks of Russia. Reports  suggest that the hackers have been in the system since the spring and  perhaps much longer. According to public reports, they may still be in  our system tonight. [[', <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S7702\">Page S7702</a>, ]  We have heard literally not a word from the White House about this,  not a single word from the President about this. I suppose this should  come as no surprise. After all, this is the same President who, to this  day, refuses to acknowledge that the Russians interfered in our 2016  election even though our intelligence agencies unanimously agree that  Russia meddled.  This is the same President who went to Helsinki and, on foreign soil,  sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a former KGB officer, over  the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, and all of our other intelligence  organizations.  The same President who spends the lion's share of almost every day  criticizing everyone from the National Football League to Greta  Thunberg, who is 17 years old, to the Secretary of State in Georgia for  upholding the rule of law can't bring himself to utter one word of  criticism for Vladimir Putin--the same President who, instead of  challenging Putin, proposed creating a joint cyber unit between the  United States and Russia. That would be like asking a burglar to design  the locks on the front door of your house.  The Trump administration is not known for its consistency, but here  is the one place they have been resolute and consistently weak,  coddling dictators and abandoning our democratic allies.  As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I can't say for sure today  whether this weakness emboldened or enabled our adversaries. We are  going to have to study the facts. But the administration's abject  fecklessness certainly hasn't helped.  To understand how weak the Trump administration has left us, it is  important to appreciate the wreckage of their total war on the Federal  Government. They came into office with a promise to dismantle ``the  administrative state,'' but what they ended up doing was dismantling  our national defenses.  Over the past 4 years, the administration drove thousands of  qualified public servants to the exit, including cyber security experts  in agency after agency critical to our national security.  Back in March, I asked the Department of Homeland Security to detail  its plans to shore up our cyber security. They responded by telling me  that they still had hundreds of vacancies for cyber security.  President Trump eliminated the top coordinator for cyber security at  the National Security Council. There is no one, therefore, coordinating  our cyber defenses across the Federal Government or engaging the  private sector to make sure we are working together to shore up those  vulnerabilities.  If you put it all together, we have been left with a gutted  bureaucracy without the necessary leadership to respond to cyber  threats and espionage in a coherent way. And a few weeks ago, the  President fired Chris Krebs, just to make matters worse, our top  Department of Homeland Security official for domestic cyber security-- the very person who would be leading our response to the hacks right  now.  But he is gone. He is gone not because he did a bad job but because  he refused to repeat the President's baseless claims about fraud in the  election, claims the President is still making as we meet here tonight  more than 6 weeks after the election and 4 days after the electoral  college confirmed Joe Biden's election.  In the last few days alone, the President has tweeted at least 25  times about fraud in the 2020 election, something he has completely  invented in his mind, but he hasn't said one word about the most far- reaching breach of cyber security in our history by a foreign  adversary.  As we meet here again tonight in the land of flickering lights,  uncertain whether we will pass a budget to keep the lights on in our  exercise of self-government for the weekend, all across the globe there  are public servants, the men and women of our intelligence services,  who are working to repair the damage that has been done and to keep us  safe. They deserve and the American people deserve a President who  makes clear that we won't tolerate intrusions like this, a President  who rallies our allies to our common cause.  If we have learned anything this year, it is that our government has  proven itself woefully unprepared to deal with emerging threats, not  only a cyber attack but also a global pandemic. This year has also  taught us that the cost of ignoring these threats is much, much greater  than the cost of addressing them head-on.  But to do that we need a President who doesn't bury his head in the  sand or his face in Twitter, a democracy that can think beyond the next  commercial break on cable news, that can put aside festering  partisanship and forge an enduring national security policy for the  21st century.  And Russia is not our only concern. I can assure you that China is  not chasing the latest controversy on Twitter or cable news. They are  building roads and bridges and airports across the globe. They are  laying fiber-optic cables beneath the ocean. They are competing with us  in space. They are forging new alliances and pioneering new  technologies every month. They are making considered choices to shape  the 21st century while we are struggling here to keep the lights on.  This lack of concern from the White House about this breach is a dark  moment, but soon we will have the chance to take another approach. I  hope everyone in this Chamber will seize the opportunity to work with  one another to secure the promise of our great country for the next  generation and America's role in the world.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. SEKULOW": " Mr. SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, so, I guess  you can buy--that is what it sounds like; you can buy a foreign  interference. If you purchase it, if you purchase their opposition  research, I guess that is OK.  So let me try to debunk the conspiracy, Manager Jeffries; and that  is, it is not conspiracy that Christopher Steele was engaged to obtain  and prepare a dossier on the Presidential candidate for the Republican  Party, Donald Trump. It is not a conspiracy that Christopher Steele  utilized his network of assets--including assets, apparently, in  Russia--to draft the dossier. It is not a conspiracy that the dossier  was shared with the Department of Justice through Bruce Ohr, who was  the No. 4 ranking member of the Department of Justice at that time,  because his wife, Nellie Ohr, happened to be working for the  organization, Fusion GPS, that was putting the dossier together. This  is also not a conspiracy. It sounds like one, except it is real. And it  is also not a conspiracy that that dossier--purchased dossier--was  taken by the FBI, submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Court to obtain a foreign intelligence surveillance order on an  American citizen. It is also not a conspiracy that that court issued an  order--two of them now--condemning the FBI's practice and acknowledging  that many of those orders were not properly issued. None of that is a  conspiracy theory. That is just the facts.  Thank you.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.  The Senator from Wisconsin.    ", "Mr. ALEXANDER": " Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call be waived.    ", "Mr. PHILBIN": " Mr. PHILBIN. They want to tell you what President Trump   thought.  Mr. Manager CROW. Now, juries, of course, are routinely asked to  determine the defendant's state of mind. That is central to almost  every criminal case in the country. And it is disingenuous for the  President's counsel to argue that the defendant's state of mind in  unknowable, that it requires a mind reader, or is anything but the most  common element of proof of any crime, constitutional or otherwise. But  if you want more information, let's ask the President whether John  Bolton can help fill in any gaps about his state of mind.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  President TRUMP. If you think about it, he knows some of my   thoughts. He knows what I think about leaders.  Mr. Manager CROW. This case is about the President's conduct in  Ukraine. John Bolton knows a lot about that. Let's hear from him. A  fair trial demands it. It is more than just ensuring a fair trial, it  is about remembering that in America, truth matters. As Mr. Bolton said  on January 30, ``the idea that somehow testifying to what you think is  true is destructive to the system of government we have, I think is  very nearly the reverse, the exact reverse of the truth.''  As Manager Schiff started this out, the truth continues to come out.  Again, in an article today, more information. The truth will come out,  and it is continuing to. The question here before this body is, What do  you want your place in history to be? Do you want your place in history  to be let's hear the truth or that we don't want to hear it?  Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Given our time constraints, we will now  summarize the reasons why Mr. Mulvaney, Mr. Duffey, and Mr. Blair are  also important. [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S758\">Page S758</a>, ]  Let's turn first to Mr. Mulvaney. To begin with, Mr. Mulvaney  participated in meetings and discussions with President Trump at every  single stage of this scheme. We just talked about motives and intent.  Well, if you want further insight into the President's motives or  intent, further direct evidence of why he withheld the military aid and  the White House meeting, you should call his Acting Chief of Staff, who  has more access than anyone.  Mr. Mulvaney is important because the President's counsel continues  to argue--incorrectly--that our evidence is just hearsay and  speculation. Faced with Ambassador Sondland and Mr. Holmes saying this  was all as clear as two plus two equals four, the President says,  ``[T]hey are just guessing.'' That is simply not true. The evidence is  direct, the evidence is compelling and confirmed by many witnesses,  corroborated by text messages, emails, and phone records. But if you  want more evidence, if you want another firsthand account of why the  aid was withheld for the undisputed quid pro quo for that White House  meeting, let's just hear from Mick Mulvaney.  Over and over again, Ambassador Sondland described to multiple  witnesses how Mr. Mulvaney was directly involved in the President's  scheme. Here is some of that testimony.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Dr. HILL. So when I came in, Gordon Sondland was basically   saying, Look, we have a deal here. There will be a meeting. I   have a deal here with Chief of Staff Mulvaney, there will be   a meeting if the Ukrainians open up or announce these   investigations into 2016 and Burisma. And I cut it off   immediately there.  Ambassador Bolton told me that: I am not part of this   whatever drug deal that Mulvaney and Sondland are cooking up.    ", "Mr. CIPOLLONE": " Mr. CIPOLLONE. Opponent.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Schiff, you may proceed.  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Before I begin, Mr. Chief Justice, the House  managers will be reserving the balance of our time to respond to the  argument of counsel for the President.  Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, fellow House managers, and counsel for  the President, I know I speak for my fellow managers, as well as  counsel for the President, in thanking you for your careful attention  to the arguments that we have made over the course of many long days.  Today, we were greeted to yet another development in the case when  the New York Times reported with a headline that says:  Trump Told Bolton to Help His Ukraine Pressure Campaign,   Book Says  The President asked his national security adviser last   spring in front of other senior advisers to pave the way for   a meeting between Rudolph Giuliani and Ukraine's new leader.  According to the New York Times:  More than two months before he asked Ukraine's president to   investigate his political opponents, President Trump directed   John R. Bolton, then his national security adviser, to help   with his pressure campaign to extract damaging information on   Democrats from Ukrainian officials, according to an   unpublished manuscript by Mr. Bolton.  Mr. Trump gave the instruction, Mr. Bolton wrote, during an   Oval Office conversation in early May that included the   acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, the   president's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and the White   House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, who is now leading the   President's impeachment defense.  You will see in a few moments--and you will recall Mr. Cipollone  suggesting that the House managers were concealing facts from this  body. He said all the facts should come out. Well, there is a new fact  which indicates that Mr. Cipollone was one of those who were in the  loop--yet another reason why we ought to hear [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S754\">Page S754</a>, ] from witnesses. Just as we predicted--and it didn't require any great  act of clairvoyance--the facts will come out. They will continue to  come out. And the question before you today is whether they will come  out in time for you to make a complete and informed judgment as to the  guilt or innocence of the President.  Now, that Times article goes on to say:  Mr. Trump told Mr. Bolton to call Volodymyr Zelensky, who   had recently won election as president of Ukraine, to ensure   Mr. Zelensky would meet with Mr. Giuliani, who was planning a   trip to Ukraine to discuss the investigations that the   President sought, in Mr. Bolton's account. Mr. Bolton never   made the call, he wrote.  ``Never made the call.'' Mr. Bolton understood that this was wrong.  He understood that this was not policy. He understood that this was a  domestic political errand and refused to make the call.  The account in Mr. Bolton's manuscript portrays the most   senior White House advisers as early witnesses in the effort   that they have sought to distance the President from.  Including the White House Counsel.  Over several pages--  According to the Times--  Mr. Bolton laid out Mr. Trump's fixation on Ukraine and the   president's belief, based on a mix of scattershot events,   assertions and outright conspiracy theories, that Ukraine   tried to undermine his chances of winning the presidency in   2016.  As he began to realize the extent and aims of the pressure   campaign, Mr. Bolton began to object, he wrote in the book,   affirming the testimony of a former National Security Council   aide, Fiona Hill, who had said that Mr. Bolton warned that   Mr. Giuliani was ``a hand grenade who's going to blow   everybody up.''  Now, as you might imagine, the President denies this. The President  said today: ``I never instructed John Bolton to set up a meeting for  Rudy Giuliani, one of the greatest corruption fighters in America.''  So here you have the President saying John Bolton is not telling the  truth. Let's find out. Let's put John Bolton under oath. Let's find out  who is telling the truth. A trial is supposed to be a quest for the  truth. Let's not fear what we will learn. As Mr. Cipollone said, let's  make sure that all facts come out.  Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, counsel for the  President, last Tuesday, at the onset of this trial, we moved for  Leader McConnell's resolution to be amended to subpoena documents and  witnesses from the outset. This body decided to hold the question over.  You have now heard opening arguments from both sides. You have seen the  evidence that the House was able to collect. You have heard about the  documents and witnesses President Trump blocked from the House's  impeachment inquiry. We have vigorously questioned both sides.  The President's counsel has urged you to decide this case and render  your verdict upon the record assembled by the House. The evidence in  the record is sufficient. It is sufficient to convict the President on  both Articles of Impeachment--more than sufficient.  But that is simply not how trials work. As any prosecutor or defense  lawyer would tell you, when a case goes to trial, both sides call  witnesses and subpoena documents to bring before the jury. That happens  every day in courtrooms all across America. There is no reason why this  impeachment trial should be any different. The commonsense practice is  borne out of precedence. There has never been--never before been--a  full Senate impeachment trial without a single witness. In fact, you  can see in the slide that in every one of the 15 prior impeachment  trials the Senate has called multiple witnesses. Today we ask you to  follow this body's uniform precedence and your common sense. We urge  you to vote in favor of subpoenaing witnesses and documents.  Now, I would like to address one question at the outset. There has  been much back and forth about whether if the House believes it has  sufficient evidence to convict, which we do, why do we need more  witnesses and documents? So I would like to be clear. The evidence  presented over the past week and a half strongly supports a vote to  convict the President. The evidence is overwhelming. We have a mountain  of evidence. It is direct, it is corroborated by multiple sources, and  it proves that the President committed grave impeachable offenses to  cheat in the next election.  The evidence confirms that if left in office, President Trump will  continue to harm America's national security. He will continue to seek  to corrupt the upcoming election. And he will undermine--he will  undermine--our democracy all to further his own personal gain.  But this is a fundamental question that must be addressed: Is this a  fair trial? Is this a fair trial? Is this a fair trial? Without the  ability to call witnesses and produce documents, the answer is clearly  and unequivocally no. It was the President's decision to contest the  facts, and that is his right, but because he has chosen to contest the  facts, he shall not be heard to complain that the House wishes to  further prove his guilt to answer the questions he would raise. He  complains that few witnesses spoke directly to the President about his  misconduct beyond his damning conversations with Sondland and Mulvaney.  OK, let's hear from others, then--the witnesses the House wishes to  call directly to the President's own words, his own admissions of  guilt, his own confessions of responsibility. If they did not, all the  President's men would be on their witness list, not ours.  These witnesses and the documents their agencies produced tell the  full story. And I believe that we are interested in hearing the full  story. You should want to hear it. More than that, the American  people--we know they want to hear it.  The House Republicans' own expert witness in the House, Professor  Turley, said, if you could prove the President used our military aid to  pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival and interfere in our  elections, it would be an impeachable abuse of power. Senator Graham,  too, recognized that, if such evidence existed, it could potentially  change his mind on impeachment.  Well, we now have another witness--a fact witness--who would  reportedly say exactly that. Ambassador Bolton's new manuscript, which  we will discuss in more detail in a moment, reportedly confirms that  the President told him in no uncertain terms--we are talking about the  former National Security Advisor saying that the President told him in  no uncertain terms--no aid until investigations, including the Bidens.  For a week and a half, the President has said no such evidence  exists. They are wrong. If you have any doubt about the evidence, the  evidence is at your fingertips. The question is: Will you let all of  us, including the American people, hear--simply hear--the evidence and  make up their own minds? And you can make up your own minds, but will  we let the American people hear all of the evidence?  You will recall that Ambassador Bolton, the President's former  National Security Advisor, is one of the witnesses we asked for last  Tuesday. We did not know, at the time, what he would say. We didn't  know what kind of witness he would be, but Ambassador Bolton made clear  that he was willing to testify and that he had relevant, firsthand  knowledge that had not yet been heard. We urged--we argued--that we all  deserved to hear that evidence, but the President opposed him. Now we  know why--because John Bolton could corroborate the rest of our  evidence and confirm the President's guilt.  So, today, Senators, we come before you, and we urge again--we  argue--that you let this witness and the other key witnesses we have  identified come forward so you will have all of the information  available to you when you make this consequential decision.  If witnesses are not called here, these proceedings will be a trial  in name only, and the American people clearly know a fair trial when  they see one. Large majorities of the American people want to hear from  witnesses in this trial, and they have a right to hear from witnesses  in this trial. Let's hear from them. Let's look them in the eye, gain  their credibility, and hear what they have to say about the President's  actions.  For the same reasons, this body should grant our request to subpoena  documents, the documents that the President also blocked the House from  obtaining--documents from the White House, the State Department, the  DOD, and the OMB--that will complete the story and provide the whole  truth, [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S755\">Page S755</a>, ] whatever that may be. We ask that you subpoena these documents so that  you can decide for yourselves. If you have any doubt as to what  occurred, let's look at this additional evidence.  To be clear, we are not asking you to track down every single  document or to call every possible witness. We have carefully  identified only four key witnesses with direct knowledge, who can speak  to the specific issues that the President has disputed, and we have  targeted key documents which we understand have already been collected.  For example, at the State Department, they have already been collected.  This will not cause a substantial delay. As I made clear last night,  these matters can be addressed in a single week. As we made clear last  night, these matters can be addressed in a single week. We know that  from President Clinton's case. There, the Senate voted to approve a  motion for witnesses on January 27. The next day, it established  procedures for those depositions and adjourned as a Court of  Impeachment until February 4. In that brief period, the parties took  three depositions. The Senate then resumed its proceedings by voting to  accept the deposition testimony into the Record.  In this trial, too, let's do the same. We should take a brief, 1-week  break for witness testimony and document collection, during which time  the Senate can return to its normal business. The trial should not be  allowed to be different from every other impeachment trial or any other  kind of trial simply because the President doesn't want us to know the  truth. The American people--the American people we all represent, the  American people we all love and care about--deserve to know the truth,  and a fair trial requires it.  This is too important of a decision to be made without all of the  relevant evidence. Before turning to the specific need for these  witnesses and documents, I want to make clear that we are not asking  you, again, to break new ground. We are asking quite the opposite. We  are asking you to simply follow the Senate's unbroken precedent and to  do so in a manner that allows you to continue the Senate's ordinary  business.  The Senate, in sitting as a Court of Impeachment, has heard witness  testimony in every other--as we have said earlier--15 impeachment  trials in the history of the Republic. In fact, these trials had an  average of 33 witnesses, and the Senate has repeatedly subpoenaed and  received new documents while adjudicating cases of impeachment. That  makes sense. Under our Constitution, the Senate does not just vote on  impeachments, and it does not just debate them. Instead, the Senate is  commanded by the Constitution to try all cases of impeachment. Well, a  trial requires witnesses. A trial requires documents. This is the  American way, and this is the American story.  If the Senate denies our motions, it would be the only time in  history it has written a judgment on Articles of Impeachment without  hearing from a single witness or receiving a single relevant document  from the President, whose conduct is on trial. And why? How can we  justify this break from precedent? How would we justify it? For what  reason would we break precedent in these proceedings?  There are many compelling reasons beyond precedent that demand  subpoenas for witnesses and cases and documents in this case.  At this time, I yield to Manager Garcia.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Chief Justice, President's counsel,  Senators, last week, I shared with you that I was reflecting on my  first days at a school for baby judges. You all may recall that. I  mentioned to you that one of the first things they told us was that we  had to be good listeners and be patient, and you, as judges in this  trial, have certainly passed the test. Thank you for being good  listeners and for being patient with us. It has been quite a long  journey.  We are here today to talk about the other thing they told us in baby  judge school, and that was that we had to give all of the parties in  front of us a fair hearing--an opportunity to be heard, an opportunity  to cross-examine witnesses, an opportunity to bring evidence. That is  what I want to talk to you about today because, in terms of fundamental  fairness, subpoenas by the Senate in this trial would mitigate the  damage caused by the President's wholesale obstruction of the House's  inquiry.  The President claims that there is no direct evidence of his  wrongdoing despite direct evidence to the contrary and Ambassador  Bolton's offer to testify to even more evidence in a trial. Let's not  forget that the President is arguing that there is no direct evidence  while blocking all of us from getting that direct evidence.  It is a remarkable position that they have taken. Quite frankly,  never, as a lawyer or as a former judge, have I ever seen anything like  this. For the first time in our history, President Trump ordered his  entire administration--his entire administration--to defy every single  impeachment subpoena. The Trump administration has not produced a  single document in response to the congressional subpoenas--not a  single page, nada. That has never happened before. There is no legal  privilege to justify a blanket blocking of all of these documents. We  know that there are more relevant documents. There is no dispute about  that; it is uncontested. Witnesses have testified in exceptional detail  about these documents that exist that the President is simply hiding.  President Trump's blanket order of prohibiting the entire executive  branch from participating in the impeachment investigation also extends  to witnesses. There are 12 in all who followed that order and refused  to testify. Much of the critical evidence we have is the result of  career officials who bravely came forward despite the President's  obstruction, but those closest to the President--some may say, like in  the musical ``Hamilton,'' those ``in the room when it happened''-- followed his instruction.  The President does not dispute that these witnesses have information  that is relevant to this trial, that these individuals have personal  and direct knowledge of the President's actions and motivations and can  provide the very evidence he says now that we don't have.  The President's counsel alleged the House managers hid evidence from  you.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. [B]ecause as house managers, really   their goal should be to give you all of the facts because   they're asking you to do something very, very consequential.  And ask yourself, ask yourself, given the fact you heard   today that they didn't tell you, who doesn't want to talk   about the facts? Who doesn't want to talk about the facts?  Impeachment shouldn't be a shell game. They should give you   the facts.  Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. This is nice rhetoric, but it is simply  incorrect.  The President's counsel cherry-picked misleading bits of evidence,  cited deposition transcripts of witnesses who subsequently corrected  their testimony in public hearings and said the opposite and, in some  cases, simply left out the second half of witness statements.  The House managers accurately presented the relevant evidence to you.  We spent about 20 hours presenting the facts and the evidence. The  President's counsel spent 4 hours focusing on the facts and the  evidence, and that evidence shows that the President is guilty. But to  the extent certain facts were shown to you, let's be very clear: We are  not the ones hiding the facts. The House managers did not hide that  evidence. President Trump hid the evidence. That is why we are the ones  standing up here, asking you to not let the President silence these  witnesses and hide these documents.  We don't know precisely what the witnesses will say or what the  documents would show, but we all deserve to hear the truth. And, more  importantly, the American people deserve to hear the truth.  Never before has a President been put--put himself above the law and  hid the facts of his offenses from the American people like this one.  We cannot let this President be different. Quite simply, the stakes are  too high.  Second, as this builds on what we have been arguing, the Senate  requires and should want a complete evidentiary record before you vote  on the most sacred task that the Constitution entrusts in every single  one of you.  I can respect that some of you have deep beliefs that the removal of  this President would be divisive. Others, [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S756\">Page S756</a>, ] you may believe that allowing this President to remain in the Oval  Office would be catastrophic to our Republic and our democracy.  But regardless of where you are, regardless of where you land on the  spectrum, you should want a full and complete record before you make a  final decision and to understand the full story. It should not be about  party affiliation; it should be about seeing all the evidence and  voting your conscience based on all the relevant facts. It should be  about doing impartial justice.  Consider the harm done to our institutions, our constitutional order,  and the public faith in our democracy if the Senate chooses to close  its eyes to learning the full truth about the President's misconduct.  How can the American people have confidence in the result of a trial  without witnesses?  Third, the President should want a fair trial. He has repeatedly said  that publicly; that he wants a trial on the merits. He specifically  said it. You saw a clip that he wanted a fair trial in the Senate, and  that would have to be with witnesses that testify, including John  Bolton and Mick Mulvaney. He said that he wants a complete and total  exoneration.  Well, whatever you say about this trial, there cannot be a total--an  exoneration without hearing from those witnesses because an acquittal  on an incomplete record after a trial lacking witnesses and evidence  will be no exoneration. It will be no vindication--not for the  President, not for this Chamber, and not for the American people.  And if the President is telling the truth and he did nothing wrong  and the evidence would prove that, then we all know that he would be an  enthusiastic supporter of subpoenas. He would be here probably himself,  if he could, urging you to do subpoenas if he had information that  would prove he was totally not in the wrong. If he is innocent, he  should have nothing to hide. His counsel should be the ones here asking  today to subpoena Bolton and Mulvaney and others for testimony.  The President would be eager to have the people closest to him to  testify about his innocence. He would be eager to present the documents  that show he was concerned about corruption and burden-sharing. But the  fact that he has so strenuously opposed the testimony of his closest  advisers and all the documents speak volumes.  You should issue subpoenas to the President so that the President can  get the fair trial that he wanted--but more importantly, so the  American people can get the fair trial that they deserve. The American  people deserve a fair trial.  I said at the onset of this trial that one of the most important  decisions you would make at this moment in history will not be whether  you convict or acquit but whether the President and the American people  will get a fair trial.  The process is more than just the ultimate decision because the faith  in our institution depends on the perception of a fair process. A vote  against witnesses and documents undermines that faith.  Senators, the American people want a fair trial. The overwhelming  majority of Americans, three in four voters--three in four--as of this  past Tuesday believe that this trial should have witnesses. Now, there  is not much that the American people agree on these days, but they do  agree on that, and they know what a fair trial is; that it involves  witnesses and it involves evidence.  The American people deserve to know the facts about their President's  conduct and those around him, and they deserve to have confidence in  this process, confidence that you made the right decision. In order to  have that confidence, the Senate must call relevant witnesses and  obtain relevant documents withheld thus far by this President. The  American people deserve a fair trial.  I now yield to my colleague Manager Crow.  Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, counsel  for the President, last week the House managers argued for the  testimony of four witnesses: Ambassador John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney,  Robert Blair, and Michael Duffey. And during the presentations from  both parties, it has become abundantly clear why the direct testimony  from those witnesses is so critical, and new evidence continues to  underscore that importance.  So let's start with John Bolton. The President's counsel has  repeatedly stated that the President didn't personally tell any of our  witnesses that he linked the military aid to the investigations.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  PURPURA: There is simply no evidence anywhere that   President Trump ever linked security assistance to any   investigations[.] [M]ost of the democrats[ witnesses have   never spoken to the President at all let alone about Ukraine   security assistance.  . . .  Not a single witness testified that the President himself   said that there was any connection between any investigations   and security assistance, a presidential meeting, or anything   else.  Mr. Manager CROW. Now, that is simply not true, as the testimony of  Ambassador Sondland and the admission of Mick Mulvaney make very clear.  The evidence before you proves that the President not only linked the  aid to the investigations, he also conditioned both the White House  meeting and the aid on Ukraine's announcement of the investigations.  But if you want more, a witness to acknowledge that the President  told them directly that the aid was linked, a witness in front of you,  then you have the power to ask for it.  I mentioned this portion--there is a slide. I mentioned this portion  of the Ambassador's manuscript in the beginning, and Manager Schiff  referenced it as well, but he said directly that the President told him  this.  Now, the President has publicly lashed out in recent days at  Ambassador Bolton. He says that Ambassador Bolton is--what Ambassador  Bolton is saying is ``nasty'' and ``untrue.'' But denials in 280  characters is not the same as testimony under oath. We know that.  Let's put Ambassador Bolton under oath and ask him point blank: Did  the President use $391 million of taxpayer money--military aid intended  for an ally at war--to pressure Ukraine to investigate his 2020  opponent? The stakes are too high not to.  I would like to briefly walk you through why Ambassador Bolton's  testimony is essential to ensuring a fair trial, also addressing some  of the questions that you have asked in the past 2 days.  First, turning back to Ambassador Bolton's manuscript, the  President's counsel has said: No scheme existed. And the President's  counsel has cited repeated denials, public denials of President Trump's  inner circle about Bolton's allegations--none of them, of course, under  oath. And as we know from the testimony of Ambassador Bolton, how  important being sworn in really is.  But Ambassador Bolton, as the top national security aide, has direct  insight into the President's inner circle, and he is willing to testify  under oath whether ``everyone was in the loop,'' as he testified  before.  Ambassador Bolton reportedly knows ``new details about senior cabinet  officials who have publicly tried to sidestep involvement,'' including  Secretary Pompeo and Mr. Mulvaney's knowledge of the scheme.  Second, Ambassador Bolton has direct knowledge of key events outside  of the July 25 call that confirm the President's scheme. Remember, this  is exactly the type of direct evidence the President's counsel say  doesn't exist. That is partly because they would like you to believe  that the July 25 call makes up all of the evidence of our case. The  call, of course, is just a part of the large body of evidence that you  have heard about the past week, but it is a key part. But Ambassador  Bolton has critical insight into the President's misconduct outside of  this call, and you should hear it.  Take, for example, the July 10 meeting with U.S. and Ukrainian  officials at the White House. Dr. Hill testified during the meeting  that Ambassador Sondland said that he had a deal with Mr. Mulvaney to  schedule a White House meeting if Ukrainians did the investigations.  According to Dr. Hill, when Ambassador Bolton learned this, he told her  to go back to the NSC's Legal Advisor, John Eisenberg, and tell him,  ``I am not a part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are  cooking up on this.'' We already have corroboration of Dr. Hill's  testimony from [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S757\">Page S757</a>, ] other witnesses like Lieutenant Colonel Vindman.  And we have new corroboration from Ukraine too. Oleksandr Danylyuk,  President Zelensky's former national security advisor, recently  confirmed in an interview that the ``roadmap [for U.S.-Ukraine  relations] should have been the substance but . . . [the  investigations] were raised.''  Danylyuk also explained why this was so problematic. He raised  concerns that being ``dragged into this internal process . . . would be  really bad for the country. And also, if there's something that  violates U.S. law, that's up to the U.S. to handle.''  Danylyuk elaborated that there were serious things to discuss at the  meeting, but if instead Ukraine was dragged into ``internal politics,  using our president who was fresh on the job, inexperienced, that could  just destroy everything.''  Another key defense raised by the President has been that Ukraine  felt no pressure, that these investigations are entirely proper. Well,  here is Ukraine saying the opposite of that. You know what else  Danylyuk said in the interview? ``It was definitely John who I  trusted,'' talking about Ambassador Bolton.  So if you want to know whether Ukrainians felt pressure, call John  Bolton as a witness. He was trusted by Ukraine, and he was there for  these key meetings, and he was so concerned that he characterized the  scheme as a ``drug deal'' and urged Dr. Hill and others to report their  concerns to NSC legal counsel, who reports to White House Counsel  Cipollone.  So let's ask Ambassador Bolton these questions directly under oath:  The President says Ukraine felt no pressure, that soliciting these  investigations wasn't improper. Is that true? If it is true, why is  Ukraine publicly saying that the talk of investigations could destroy  everything? And if the President's administration thought this was OK,  why did you use the words ``drug deal?'' We should ask him that. Why  did you urge your staff to report concerns to lawyers? These are all  questions that we can get the answers to.  Third, the President has suggested the House managers have not  presented any direct evidence about Mr. Giuliani's role in the scheme.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Ms. Counsel RASKIN. In fact, it appears the House committee   wasn't particularly interested in presenting you with any   direct evidence of what Mayor Giuliani did or why he did it.   Instead, they ask you to rely on hearsay, speculation, and   assumption, evidence that would be inadmissible in any court.  Mr. Manager CROW. Well, once again, that is simply not true. But if  you want more evidence, we know that Ambassador Bolton has direct  evidence of Mr. Giuliani's role regarding Ukraine and expressed  concerns about it.  The President has suggested that Mr. Giuliani wasn't doing anything  improper, and he was not involved in conducting policy. By their own  admission, they said he wasn't doing policy. So let's ask John Bolton  what Giuliani was doing and whether the investigations were politically  motivated or part of our foreign policy.  He would know. Dr. Hill testified that Ambassador Bolton said Mr.  Giuliani was ``a hand grenade,'' which he explained referred to ``all  of the statements that Mr. Giuliani was making publicly, that the  investigations that he was promoting, that the story line he was  promoting, the narrative he was promoting was going to backfire.'' The  narrative Mr. Giuliani was promoting, of course, was asking Ukraine to  dig up dirt on Biden.  Dr. Hill also testified that Ambassador Bolton was so concerned, he  told Dr. Hill and other members of the NSC staff that ``nobody should  be meeting with Giuliani,'' and that he was ``closely monitoring what  Mr. Giuliani was doing and the messaging he was sending out.''  So let's ask Ambassador Bolton: If Mr. Giuliani wasn't doing anything  wrong, why were you so concerned about his behavior that you directed  your staff to have no part in this? If Mr. Giuliani wasn't trying to  dig up dirt on Biden, why did you seem to think that he could ``blow  everything up''?  Fourth, the President has said that there was nothing wrong with the  July 25 call. But once again the evidence suggests that Ambassador  Bolton would testify that the opposite is true. According to witness  testimony, Ambassador Bolton expressed concerns even before the call  that it would be ``a disaster'' because he thought there could be  ``talk of investigations or worse.'' Now, if the President would have  you believe that the call was perfect, as he has repeatedly stated, why  don't we find out? Because all of the evidence before you suggests  otherwise.  And Ukraine knows this is not the case. The call was not perfect.  Danylyuk is clear on this point. He said:  One thing I can tell you that was clear from this [July 25]   call is that the issue of the investigations is an issue of   concern for Trump. It was clear.  But if there is still any uncertainty, we must ask Ambassador Bolton:  If there was no scheme, how did you know President Trump would raise  investigations on the call? What made you so concerned the call would  be a ``disaster''?  Fifth, the President's main defense, once again, is that he withheld  the military aid for legitimate reasons. But the evidence doesn't  support that. You have heard a lot. The evidence doesn't support that.  Witness testimony, emails, and other documents confirm that Ambassador  Bolton and his subordinates on many occasions, including through in- person meetings with the President himself, urged the President that  there was no legitimate reason to withhold the aid.  But if you are not sure, if you think this could in any way have been  about a legitimate policy reason, let's ask the National Security  Advisor, who was in charge of that. If this was simply a policy  dispute, as the President argues, let's ask John Bolton whether that is  true.  The President also argues that you cannot evaluate the President's  subjective intent--that the President can use his power any way he  feels is appropriate. That is, of course, not the case. Whether his  intent was corrupt is a central part of this case, as it is in nearly  every criminal case in the country. As a backup argument, however, the  President's counsel claims that we want you to read the President's  mind.  (Text of Videotape presentation:)  Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. This entire impeachment process is   about the House managers' insistence that they are able to   read everybody's thoughts. They can read everybody's   intention . . .  Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. They think you can read minds.    ", "Mr. MCCONNELL": " Mr. MCCONNELL.

Mr. President, it is an honor to speak in strong  support of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to serve as an Associate Justice on  the Supreme Court of the United States. After careful review of her  record and her outstanding testimony during her confirmation hearing,  it is clear that Judge Barrett is well suited for a lifetime  appointment on the Court.  Last week, Judge Barrett firmly held her own during hours and hours  of questioning from my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. She did  not once falter during her hearing. In fact, she excelled. Judge  Barrett proved to the [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S6350\">Page S6350</a>, ] American people that she is prepared, talented, compassionate, and, not  to mention, brilliant. Judge Barrett demonstrated that she is an  independent individual who can think for herself. She made it clear  that she is an originalist who will follow the law.  Without a single note or binder in front of her, Judge Barrett  repeatedly affirmed that she would interpret the Constitution and laws  passed by Congress as they were written--no more, no less.  During her hearing, Judge Barrett testified:  I apply the law. I follow the law. You make the policy.  The judge kept pointing out that we, the Senate, are the legislators.  She stressed that she has no mission or agenda to change the law as she  would want it. Judge Barrett made it abundantly clear that in her role  as a jurist, she has no issues with setting aside her personal beliefs  when applying the letter of the law. This mindset and legal philosophy  is exactly the type of jurist we need on our Nation's highest Court.  Not only did we hear from Judge Barrett, but we heard from her former  professors, colleagues, and students. These are the people who know her  best. These individuals were witnesses not only to her intellect but  her character as well. The testimonies on her behalf only proved her  absolute readiness for this position.  Americans should be celebrating the nomination of Judge Barrett. She  is brilliant, hard working, ambitious, and a proud mother and wife. In  a time when we need role models for our youth, Judge Barrett fills that  role.  The judge is a family-oriented woman who reveres the Constitution.  She is a representative for working women across the country and a  testament that women can have a career and family and be stunningly  successful at both.  I also appreciate that she has displayed great strength in  withstanding affronts to her faith and her family during the  confirmation process.  If confirmed--and I am confident that she will be--Amy Coney Barrett  will have the honor to be the fifth woman in history to serve on the  Supreme Court. The first judge as a mother of school-aged children, she  will be the only sitting judge on the Court to not have attended an Ivy  League law school.  We must continue to ensure that women like Judge Barrett are  represented in the highest levels of our judicial system. Judge  Barrett's life experiences as a judge, lawyer, teacher, wife, and  mother will bring a valuable and much needed perspective to the Supreme  Court.  I am proud to support Judge Barrett. Now the Senate must do its  constitutional duty and confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett as soon as  possible.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mrs. COLLINS": " Mrs. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from  Arizona, Senator Sinema, in introducing legislation to support the  operation of a national child abuse hotline. Of all the major national  help hotlines, the crisis line for child abuse and neglect, which is  currently operated by a national nonprofit, is the only one without a  federal authorization and dedicated federal funding. Our bill, the  National Child Abuse Help Hotline Act of 2020, would give the  Administration for Children and Families the authority to award a grant  to a national nonprofit to support a hotline dedicated to the  prevention and intervention of child abuse and neglect. The child abuse  and neglect crisis happening across the United States has only been  exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.  On average, five children die every day from child abuse and neglect.  According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Child  Maltreatment Report, which was published in January 2020 and reflects  2018 figures, 678,000 children were victims of maltreatment in 2018 and  a heartbreaking 1,770 children died--including three in Maine. These  statistics reflect an unfortunate increase in both child fatalities and  victims of maltreatment, and is the first increase for the number of  victims who suffered maltreatment since 2015.  Access to prevention and intervention services nationwide has only  become more critical in the face of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The  current crisis threatens to severely exacerbate child abuse and  neglect, and a number of experts predict that child abuse is currently  being underreported. In Maine, when schools closed their doors on March  16 and stay-at-home orders went in place, calls to Maine Child and  Family Services decreased immediately, falling 32 percent in the first  month. Of note, only seven percent of calls were from school personnel,  which is a dramatic drop from the 22 percent of teachers and other  school staff--more than any other group--who call in typically to  report abuse and neglect.  With stay-at-home orders, school closures, and high unemployment,  families are experiencing financial stress, isolation, and new  anxieties at the very time when children have less exposure to  mandatory reporters--such as teachers, physicians, and coaches--and  safe environments where one may normally escape or seek help. In April,  Dr. Larry Ricci, a child abuse pediatrician at Spurwink, located in  Portland, Maine, said ``our sense is that not only is abuse still  happening at the same rate it was happening before, in all likelihood  it has increased.'' Dr. Ricci pointed out that ``We've known for many  years that the abuse rate mirrors the unemployment rate.'' And as  Michelle Fingerman, Vice President for Childhelp, a national nonprofit  and the current operator of the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline  located in Arizona, details: ``There is a wide range of fallout from  pandemic anxiety and school shutdowns. There is more abuse already  occurring in homes where caregivers are melting down from the stress,  children are trapped at home with abusers, schools and daycare are  closed, and therapists and other frontline providers are now more  difficult to access.''  During a time when children are not going to school, day care, or  family resource centers, and, therefore, traditional resources may not  be as easily accessible, the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline is  a resource that is accessible to children and families across the  country. The hotline, 1-800-4-A-CHILD, saw call volume increase by 33  percent from February to May. Childhelp's text and online chat  platform, which is supported by a $1 million ACF Innovation Grant that  I have advocated for as a member of the Appropriations Committee,  experienced a 66 percent increase in outreach since February.  The helpline importantly serves a wide range of individuals in every  single state--at-risk children, distressed parents seeking crisis  intervention, and concerned individuals who suspect that child abuse  may be occurring. In Maine, where one in every 71 children is a victim  of abuse, the National Child Abuse Hotline assisted nearly 200 callers  in fiscal year 2019. Those in need are connected--either on the phone  or by text or online chat--with masters-level social workers who are  there to offer confidential crisis intervention and information,  literature, and referrals to emergency, social service, and support  resources.  The bill we are introducing today would provide a small but  meaningful federal investment to protect children across the country-- authorizing $1 million annually for the Administration for Children and  Families (ACF) to award a grant to a nonprofit entity to support a 24- hour, national, toll-free telephone hotline that will provide  information and assistance to victims of [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S4547\">Page S4547</a>, ] child abuse or neglect, parents, caregivers, mandated reporters, and  other concerned community members. This does not interfere with any  state-mandated reporter hotlines and can be a resource for these  individuals. In fact, the current operator has more than 80 community  partners in just Maine alone.  The helpline's dedication to the prevention and intervention of child  abuse and neglect is both successful and well-documented, and more  federal support for this resource will improve our ability to reach  children of all ages, as well as parents or caregivers in need. During  a time when these supports are needed more there an ever, I believe the  existing infrastructure and experience of the National Child Abuse  Hotline should be used. Even with just more outreach and  communications, we could better support the needs of children and  families during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and economic recovery.  Action and investment now can help prevent the worst possible outcome-- letting children fall through the cracks during an already traumatizing  crisis.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to put the welfare of our  nation's children at the forefront of our national Covid-19 response  and to support the adoption of this important legislation, which will  benefit children and families in the age of Covid-19, as well as after  this pandemic passes.  Thank you, Mr. President.    ", "Mr. MURKOWSKI": " Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to  meet during today's session of the Senate.

It  has been made clear that we are going to have an opportunity to bring  up for discussion legislation that has been drafted by Senator Tim  Scott from South Carolina, along with a group of fellow colleagues over  here, focused on matters relating to policing reforms.  My hope--it is more than a hope; it is really a prayer. My prayer is  that we will come to this floor next week as colleagues and as  individuals who want to bring to bear good policy for a country at a  time that is so desperate for leadership that is responsive, leadership  that has demonstrated a willingness to listen to the raw emotion of  what we have seen expressed across this country in the few weeks since  the terrible death and killing of George Floyd but recognizing that it  is far more than the horrible death of one individual. It is a history  that in many parts of our country is raw and open and needs to be  addressed.  My prayer is that we can come to this floor not here to debate  through a partisan lens but here to debate those issues that are so  important and so imperative for the American public to hear; that the  response is not a Republican effort versus a Democratic effort, but  that these are matters that we must address, whether it is how we  ensure that there is full and fair accountability, whether it relates  to safe policing practices, whether it is how we address the concerns  with modern policing when there are issues before our law enforcement  officers that span the scope of how we address mental health issues-- those with addictions--and how we respond from a broader view and lens  but do so with our hearts rather than trying to project through our  political alignment.  I even hesitate to say because some would ask: Well, exactly what do  you mean by that?  I guess what I am asking for us to do is to come here and debate  honestly about where we are as a nation, and that comes to ensuring  that when we speak of justice, that we speak of justice for all in a  way that is inclusive, that is fair, that is equal, and that is  compassionate; that we recognize that the men and women who get up  every morning or stay out late every evening to protect and defend,  that we are there with them and for them as they serve us.  I am asking for us to come into our work next week with open hearts  and open minds, having listened well. If we do that, I can only suspect  that the outcome will be good.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    ", "Mr. BLUMENAUER": " Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam President, I am proud to talk about the  National Defense Authorization Act, which has come to this body with a  strong bipartisan vote from the Armed Services Committee where I serve.  I am proud to have helped to craft this legislation, and I am proud to  be voting for some of the amendments that have been permitted votes on  the floor.  One that has not been permitted relates to the Insurrection Act, a  213-year-old law that has been invoked at various points in our history  to protect civil rights as it was during the era of desegregation, but  President Trump has threatened to use this slavery-era law to silence  calls for justice from Americans protesting centuries of racist  oppression.  In effect, he has threatened to invert the Insurrection Act to  deprive Americans of their First Amendment right. So I introduced a  bill called the CIVIL Act that would preserve Presidential  accountability to Congress whenever the Insurrection Act is invoked. It  would require the President to consult with Congress prior to invoking  the act and provide certification to Congress to justify the use of  this authority. It has other provisions.  It was voted down in the markup of the Armed Services Committee, but  I sought a vote on the floor. Apparently, it will not happen.  If the President uses force against Americans at home, Congress  should demand at least the same check that applied to his use of force  against adversaries abroad.  I offered this act as an amendment, and I am grateful to all my  Democratic colleagues on the committee for supporting it. I am also  grateful to the House of Representatives, which, just yesterday, passed  an NDAA amendment to its bill modifying the CIVIL Act, which I  introduced. It is called the Curtailing Insurrection Act Violations of  Individuals' Liberties. I would like to thank my colleagues on the  House side who supported this amendment, particularly Congresswoman  Escobar, who led the charge in the House Armed Services Committee and  on the House floor.  I urge our colleagues, whether it is now in the course of considering  the NDAA or at some point in the future, to hold the President, any  President--we are talking not only about this President but any  President--accountable when he uses military force against Americans.  When the American military and troops of our country are used against  Americans, there ought to be at least the same accountability as when  American troops are used abroad, with the same kind of checks--maybe  not identical, but the same kinds of checks--because the President  using troops against our own citizens denies, potentially, fundamental  freedoms, and the need for accountability is even more urgent. Our  military should defend liberties, not endanger them, misdirected by a  misguided President.  Despite my disappointment in the Senate's lack of action to curtail  the President's unaccountable use and abuse of military power, I am  proud of a number of provisions that I also authored in this bill that  invest in our most valuable military asset, our servicemembers and  their families.  I am grateful to all of the military spouses and advocates from  across the country who shared their challenges with me and my office.  Their stories, their voice, and their faces made an immensely impactful  difference. We used their experience to craft these overdue policies.  I want to say to those families--to the spouses and loved ones--that  they serve as much as the men and women they support in uniform.  The NDAA includes important provisions that I championed to hold  commanders accountable to military families, make childcare more  affordable, expand support for military moms, and prevent mental health  discrimination. These measures are profoundly important.  Provisions I authored with Senator Kaine will make childcare more  affordable by authorizing hardship waivers, requiring fee reductions  for families with more than one child. And the NDAA will support those  military moms by extending TRICARE to include other kinds of services.  The Connecticut military industrial base will benefit from the  increased expenditure and the robust investment in two Virginia-class  submarines. My priority during the negotiations on the conference  committee will be to advance this cause.  These provisions for expanding our production of submarines and other  military platforms must also focus on our supply base, on the workforce  that keeps us safe, and on men and women who comprise, indeed, the most  talented workforce, using and building unmatched military technology to  keep our countries secure.  We should keep in mind the families of our military and continue  fighting for even more provisions that enable them to continue their  great work, but these military platforms assure that our troops will  never have a fair fight--that they will always be superior, no matter  what the terrain or arena or the fight.  I am pleased that the NDAA makes robust investments in Connecticut's  industrial base. I will make as my top priority during negotiations of  the conference committee to restore full funding for two submarines,  even beyond the commitment in this NDAA, to a second Virginia-class  submarine in this budget authorization.  I was pleased, again, to see action by the House, which provides for  two fully funded Virginia-class submarines in the House Armed Services  Committee version of the NDAA.  In addition to fully funding the first Columbia-class submarine--a  historic milestone for this program--the Senate version added an  additional $175 million for Columbia-class supplier development. The  heroes in this story are not only the big contractors. They are the  supply chains--not only the companies with hundreds of employees but  the components makers and the parts manufacturers that may make tiny  pieces of the submarine by comparison to its massive length. They are  all heroes of our defense industrial production.  People are the foundation of the submarine industrial base, and this  bill authorizes an additional $20 million in workforce development  funding. I will seek to expand the supplier development program, which  provides the kind of support that the supply chain needs.  We must ensure that the final bill preserves not only the necessary  levels of funding for the Virginia-class and the Columbia-class  submarines but also for continued growth of our fifth generation  fighter fleet. It is a key component of our national defense. The  Senate version of the NDAA authorizes the growth of the F-35 fleet by  93 aircraft, including 14 aircraft above the President's budget  request.  I remain a staunch advocate of the CH-53K program. I was happy to see  the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee fund nine CH-53K  helicopters. I am going to work to ensure that the final NDAA also  authorizes nine helicopters.  I want to congratulate and thank Sikorsky, Pratt & Whitney, Raytheon  Technologies, and, again, the many suppliers throughout Connecticut  that contribute to an aerospace program second to none in the world.  Finally, let me talk a little bit about the Fair Care for Vietnam  Veterans Act of 2020. Later this week, we will vote on an amendment to  the NDAA based on a bicameral Fair Care for Veterans Act of 2020.  In March, I, along with Senator Tester and 30 Senate colleagues,  introduced this legislation to require the VA to provide benefits for  veterans suffering from bladder cancer, hypothyroidism, Parkinsonism,  and hypertension.  The National Academy recognizes that these illnesses have an  association with herbicide exposure. It reached that conclusion in  2016. Since then, I have been fighting, along with many of my  colleagues, to get the VA to include these four conditions as  presumptive conditions linked to Agent Orange, [[\", <a href=\"/congressional-record/volume-166/senate-section/page/S4339\">Page S4339</a>, ] only to have this administration's officials block us at every turn.  Despite the scientific proof--the incontrovertible science that these  conditions are linked to Agent Orange--and despite more than 83,000  veterans who suffer from these conditions, the Trump administration's  VA resisted and refused to acknowledge the connection.  I look forward to voting to add bladder cancer, hypothyroidism, and  Parkinsonism to the list of Agent Orange presumptives. One condition in  our bill, hypertension, was not included in this NDAA amendment, but I  am committed to adding it during conference. It is supported by the  science as a condition linked to Agent Orange.  The Trump administration says it doesn't want to spend the money to  cover the four conditions in this bill, but when we send people to war,  we make a commitment. We make a commitment, and we accept an obligation  to treat them, no matter what the cost, no matter what the cause of  their service-related injuries are when the science and the facts  support it. Facts are stubborn things, as many have said. To the  veterans in Connecticut and nationwide, I will never stop fighting to  get good healthcare for our veterans. I know this issue is bipartisan  in its support.  I look forward to voting in favor of the fiscal year 2021 NDAA, but I  also think our colleagues must recognize that military spending alone  does not guarantee our national security. These weapons platforms and  the hardware that we produce does not constitute, alone, our national  defense. It is the quality of our people, whether they are in the  supply chain or the defense establishment or our troops on the ground  or in the air or at sea. To recruit and train the best possible  military, we need to have a strong nonmilitary infrastructure.  Education, healthcare, housing--our national defense includes those  essential components.  So I believe that we must scrutinize this budget with a view to  reducing any expenditures that are unnecessary.  I will state as a matter of principle that when we vote on this NDAA,  I will be supportive of amendments that might potentially achieve more  equity and effectiveness in the way we make commitments in support of  our national defense. We must interpret as broadly as is necessary how  that defense must be supported.  It is not alone the money in this NDAA; it is also what we commit to  racial justice in this country; the quality of our policing and our  education, which should not depend on a young person's ZIP Code; the  quality of our healthcare, which right now has racial disparities that  are inexcusable; housing that often results from redlining; and  protections in the workplace, which could be achieved by a fairer, more  effective use of OSHA.  The quality of our society and our projection of power abroad depend  on our quality of life and the quality of services that we provide on  education, healthcare, housing, and all of the other infrastructure,  including transportation. We need to consider those factors and do what  is necessary to assure that our warfighters and our military never have  a fair fight, that they always predominate on the battlefield. We must  protect our veterans to whom we make the commitment that we will always  have their backs when they come home.  I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. BARASSO": " Mr. BARASSO.

", "Mrs. ERNST": " Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I am honored to congratulate Waverly's Randy Druvenga on the conclusion of his tenure as Chair of the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies--NAMIC--a member organization of property and casualty insurance companies. Randy has helped lead this organization through its 125th year of existence, including the NAMIC Mutual Insurance Foundation's drive to raise $125,000 for scholarships to help talented young Americans pursue their college degrees toward careers in insurance. It is fitting that Randy led NAMIC during this milestone anniversary as the association was founded by Iowans in 1895. While the Hawkeye State is happy to share Randy with NAMIC, we are most proud of his servant leadership in his home State. Randy has served as the past president of the Mutual Insurance Association of Iowa and is currently president of First Maxfield Mutual Insurance Association, a farm mutual insurance company serving more than 7,900 policyholders in northeast Iowa. He is a constant presence in his community, supporting numerous causes including the Waverly-Shell Rock Community Schools Foundation, and as a former referee and member of the Iowa High School Athletic Association Officials Hall of Fame. I want to again congratulate Randy Druvenga for his leadership. Iowans are famous for their commitment to their communities, and Randy embodies that spirit at home and beyond.   ", "Ms. FEINSTEIN": " Ms. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  ``Addressing Climate Financial Risk Act,'' which I introduced today.  Background  The average global temperature has increased by over 3 degrees  Fahrenheit in parts of my home State of California over the last  century, and 2020 is on track to be the hottest year on record. Climate  change is driving the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires,  floods, droughts, and other natural disasters and extreme weather  events.  In California, wildfires in particular have become a major annual  concern. This year alone, wildfires have burned 4.1 million acres of  California forests and destroyed more than 10,000 structures, including  more than 5,000 homes.  The damage and risk generated by these events--in addition to the  changes needed to transition to a lower-carbon economy--threaten to  severely disrupt real estate values in high-risk areas, make insuring  against risk increasingly unaffordable, and dramatically change whole  sectors of the economy.  Need for Legislation  Unfortunately, U.S. Federal financial regulators have not done enough  to ensure that they fully understand and are appropriately acting on  the risk that climate change poses to the stability of the U.S.  financial system.  Therefore, I believe there are a series of simple steps we should  take to ensure that U.S. financial regulators are well-equipped to  mitigate climate financial risk.  This bill would make five main improvements to the U.S. financial  regulatory system.  First, it would establish a permanent committee on the Financial  Stability Oversight Council (FSOC)--which Congress has charged with  identifying risks to the U.S. financial system--made up of experts in  climate science, climate economics, and climate financial risk.  This committee would assist FSOC in publishing a report that assesses  the ability of the U.S. financial regulatory system to mitigate climate  financial risk and makes recommendations for improving its ability to  do so.  Second, the bill would require each Federal bank and credit union  regulatory agency to update its supervisory guidance to include climate  financial risk, and to develop a strategy to identify and mitigate  climate financial risk.  Third, the bill would require FSOC to specify how it will take  climate financial risk into account when making decisions on whether to  subject nonbank financial firms to additional oversight by the Federal  Reserve Board.  Fourth, the bill would mandate a report from the Federal Insurance  Office on how to modernize and improve the regulation of climate  financial risk insurance regulation in the United States.  Finally, the bill would express the sense of Congress that climate  change is a global problem, and that U.S. financial regulators should  join international organizations focused on addressing climate  financial risk and work with financial regulators in other countries to  the extent possible and consistent with U.S. law.  Conclusion  Climate change is real. It's happening now and it will have a  profound effect on our financial system if we continue to do nothing.  We must act to ensure that federal financial regulators have expertise  in climate financial risk and develop approaches to mitigate that risk.  I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill. Thank you,  Mr. President, and I yield the floor.    ", "Mr. SCOTT": " Mr. SCOTT. So if my colleague from New Jersey's concern is the  paragraph numbered 4 on page 3, I would ask him if he would object if  we just take that paragraph out and then he would be willing to affirm  that the Senate believes in religious freedom.    ", "Mr. STABENOW": " Mr. STABENOW. Mr. President, I want to take one other moment just to  also speak and thank everybody that is involved at this point in  getting us to where we are on this very important survival package.  I have never felt this was a COVID stimulus. It is about helping  people survive over the next several months, whether that is making  sure they have a roof over their head and food on the table, can pay  the bills, keep the heat on. In places like North Dakota and places  like Ohio, it is going to get pretty cold this winter. Our small  businesses, our farmers, our schools that need help to be able to  succeed, all the support we need to provide for vaccine distribution  and healthcare, and all of the other areas--this has been a tough  negotiation.  I do want to say, on a couple of points where I have been deeply  involved, I want to thank the Presiding Officer for his support and  help on our nutrition and agriculture pieces. We have come together in  a very important step. It is going to allow more people to get help to  feed their families over the next several months--no small thing.  We have a hunger crisis in our country. We have people who have  donated to the food bank, worked for the food bank, and are now sitting  for hours in cars, waiting to drive up and get a box of food, in the  United States of America.  And so what we are doing as part of this package is going to be  significant to help people be able to purchase food in the grocery  store, as well as to get help in other ways--to help our seniors with  Meals on Wheels, to help our children who aren't able to eat in school  right now, and our college students who don't have the opportunity to  be on campus and get support.  So we have very significant food access and nutrition, very positive  efforts in this legislation. And for our farmers, as well, across the  country, there is significant support, as well as help in our food  chain and supply chain areas, where we have all been concerned as we  have watched those involved in the supply chain lose their markets in  restaurants and so on but not have the support and the capacity to take  that milk or take those other commodities and be able to move them over  and package them differently for consumers to go to the food bank. We  make some headway in supporting that, as well, in this legislation.  So I want to thank my colleagues. This is really the last negotiation  that Senator Roberts and I have led, as he retires this year. And it  has been, as I have said before, a great pleasure to work with him and  to be able to achieve this effort--bipartisan effort.  The one thank-you I just want to give is in a whole other area that  has been a passion of mine that I have been proud to lead with a  colleague from Missouri, Senator Roy Blunt. We have very significant  support, as well, for behavioral health services, mental health,  substance abuse services that are desperately needed and have been  amplified, and the need has been expanded even more because of what has  happened with the coronavirus.  And there is important support in this legislation, as well, and I am  grateful to be involved in pushing that forward as well.  So there is more to talk about. I know we are a little ways away from  that final vote, but I am hopeful that the coalition that was formed-- that all of us working together that brought this together and  negotiated, and my colleagues who initiated this bipartisan effort-- will find that this is a coalition we want to keep going for next year,  because there is so much more that we need to do together, and the  American people expect us to get things done. And this, I hope, is the  first step of many to celebrate ways that we are solving problems and  helping people and moving the country forward.  Thank you, Mr. President.    "}
